I also congratulate to him on his appointment.<\/p> <p>I thank him for coming to the House to discuss what is becoming an increasingly frustrating issue for many voluntary schools, groups and commercial entities.  This frustration is accentuated as this is a busy time of year for those who work with children with the school holidays generating increased activity.  Vetting is a cornerstone of any child welfare strategy and is essential to best practice when recruiting people who work with children or vulnerable persons.  The protection and safeguarding of our nation's children is rightly at the forefront of the vetting process.  However, the current delays are having a major impact on those on whom we rely to safely work with children.  It is almost two months since the new e-vetting system went live with much fanfare but the feedback my office has received from child care facilities, kids' sports camps, schools and clubs, unfortunately, is that inordinate delays remain.<\/p> <p>The previous statistic that turnaround only took four weeks was grossly misleading and I wonder if the new target time of just five working days is another red herring.  Under the previous system, while it may have taken less than four weeks for garda&iacute; to log and enter the vetting application, delays of up to three months were still being encountered at the formal vetting stage undertaken by an outside body.  One constituent who contacted me explained that in ten years of working with children, the quickest he had ever had an application completed was ten weeks.<\/p> <p>While the delays, both previous and current, were bad enough, these were further compounded by the wall of silence and bureaucracy the applicants and service providers have been met with when trying to establish the status of their applications, with indefinite periods of delay constantly chipping away at the viability of their operations.  This lengthy timeframe is simply unsustainable, especially for commercial entities working in this sector, many of which rely on part-time or seasonal staff.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For these companies, replacing staff is an absolute nightmare, as they know that after hiring someone it can be months before he or she can actually start working.  This, in turn, costs contracts, leads to disappointment and completely undermines the sector.  The delays stop companies from getting off the ground, prevent people from starting work and limit the options open to parents and others in terms of the services available to children.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State provide a comprehensive report on how the new vetting system is working?  What are realistic and the actual waiting times?  Have the delays really been eradicated?  I am not convinced that they have and want to know what is causing them.  Is it the due diligence process and, if so, can it be improved?  Is it the number of applications which previously stood at 30,000 a month and, if so, can more resources be allocated?  Is it seasonal changes to the volume of applications and, if so, can they be addressed in the months in which additional resources are needed?  As in the case of the passport system, is there scope to introduce a fast-track system for companies or voluntary bodies which, for a fee, are able to have an application fully processed within ten working days in response to exceptional need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#A00500","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his welcome.  As he stated, this is my first time to address the House and I wish all new Senators the best of luck for the future.  My approach on all issues, particularly disabilities, will be to work closely with all Senators.  If they need help or support, they should not hesitate to knock on my door and I will facilitate them to the best of my ability.<\/p> <p>I am responding on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who is grateful to the House for giving her the opportunity to clarify matters so far as this issue is concerned.  The Senator will be pleased to note that there is no undue delay in the processing of applications for persons who require Garda vetting.  The T&aacute;naiste has been informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications is actually four weeks.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the national vetting bureau provides employment vetting for organisations registered with the Garda for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity in positions where they have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  Garda vetting applications are processed as they are received in the national vetting bureau and all organisations registered for Garda vetting are aware of the processing timeframes and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  To put the scale of the operation being conducted by the national vetting bureau into some perspective, in 2015 the bureau, or the Garda central vetting unit as it was then known, processed 335,427 applications for vetting.  This year, up to 31 May, it has processed 129,651 applications, of which 80% were processed within the four week timeframe alluded to.<\/p> <p>Approximately 18,000 organisations are in receipt of vetting services from the national vetting bureau, covering a wide range of health, educational, sports and recreational sectors.  The bureau provides ongoing support and advice for the organisations concerned in managing their vetting requirements.  There will, of course, always be some individual cases where additional inquiries may be necessary and this may result in processing times in excess of the average.  That is one of the points raised by the Senator.  The primary consideration of the bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  That is the key issue.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.<\/p> <p>Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of measures to protect children and vulnerable adults, while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not considered unreasonable.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also committed to ensuring the service provided is delivered in as modern and efficient a manner as possible, which takes advantage of developments in technology.  In this context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-vetting system on 29 April which will facilitate the processing of applications in an online format, thus removing the current time consuming process of manual applications.  E-vetting will further streamline the vetting process and contribute to sustaining reduced processing times for vetting applications.  The e-vetting system has been designed to be compatible with the requirements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and, in this regard, was launched in tandem with the commencement of the Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#B00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply which is slightly disappointing for obvious reasons.  Part of the point I raised has been missed.  I queried the all-in timeframe of the process, not just the amount of time an application rests with the Garda or the body to which the vetting process has been outsourced.  It concerns the period from the time a body submits an application for vetting and to when there is the final clarification.  All of the evidence presented to my office by Montessori schools and children's sports camps shows that it is not a four-week process, that the timeframe involved has not been reduced and that there is still an inordinate delay.  From an employment point of view, when one loses a number of staff members who give two or three weeks' notice, knowing that it will take at least four weeks to have a replacement vetted is one thing, but when the delay extends from four to six, eight or ten weeks, it makes many organisations completely unviable and thus completely restricts what is open to parents and guardians in terms of services they can provide for their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#B00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Of course, I take the issues raised on board and will report back to the Minister.

The point made in the answer I gave on behalf of the Minister is that approximately 80% of applications are processed within a reasonable timeframe, but in the 20% of cases about which the Senator speaking we must ensure we make the process more efficient.  We must act on this issue.  The Senator mentioned commercial activities, sensitivities and the viability of operations.  Of course, we must take these issues on board.

I am particularly pleased that for the first time we have a Minister of State at the Cabinet table looking at the issue of inclusion for people with disabilities, which is a whole-of-government issue.  It is a unique role and, in a sense, the Minister of State has in some way become the conscience of the Cabinet on this issue to ensure effective implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is the linchpin.  Ireland signed the convention in March 2007, which means that we have had almost ten years to prepare for its ratification and introduce the legislative measures required.  At the recent European disability forum conference the Minister of State stated - it has been said over and over - that Ireland's approach had always been not to ratify international treaties until it was ready to implement them.  My simple and logical response, therefore, is that once the convention is ratified, everything has to move and all the buttons must be green.  However, the legislation still needs to be put in place.  The other practical measures to be included in the upcoming budget and resources also need to be put in place.<\/p> <p>I present the Minister of State with an opportunity to confirm that work is under way in Departments and public services to ensure implementation, that ratification will take place before the end of 2016 and that budget 2017 will include resources to progress implementation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> On the legislative side, I mentioned the roadmap, which has been published.  In conjunction with that, however, practical measures must now be put in place with regard to the upcoming budget.  There is a raft of such measures in terms of health, housing, personal assistants, the cost of disability services, transport and many more.<\/p><p>People with disabilities can characterise the recession years in two key ways.  First, there were repeated commitments that their services and supports would be protected and prioritised.  Second, as time went on, there was a gross understatement or under-acknowledgement of the depth and scope of the cuts that continue to impact upon people with disabilities and their families in terms of participation in everyday life in this country.  If a credible start is not made at this stage, people with disabilities can well draw the conclusion that they were hoodwinked during the past decade.  The Oireachtas has not kept faith with them.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is simply a methodology to give effect to the emancipation of 600,000 people.<\/p><p>I have no doubt whatsoever that Ireland can implement the convention well in the time ahead.  We have the resolve, ambition and confidence to do so.  It will be the right and proper thing to do for people with disabilities and, equally, for the economic, moral and social development of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#B00500","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator John Dolan for his best wishes and I congratulate him on being elected to the Seanad.  I have known John for many years and I am aware of the magnificent work he has done with the Disability Federation of Ireland.  It is very important that people with disabilities have a voice in the Seanad.  I wish the Senator well in the future.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Dolan for raising this very important topic, which is also very important to me.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the issue of Ireland's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and to provide an update on the work under way to meet our ratification targets.<\/p> <p>The Roadmap to Ratification published by the previous Government last October detailed all the remaining legislative barriers to ratification and the work that would be undertaken to overcome them.  It also set out a clear timeframe, and I can confirm that we are on track to achieve our target of ratification of both the convention and its optional protocol by the end of this year.  That is something I am working very hard to achieve.<\/p> <p>Much has been achieved already in terms of overcoming the obstacles to ratification outlined in the roadmap, with the enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001, which removed the authority to administer electroconvulsive therapy or medicine, after a three-month period, to an involuntary patient with capacity who is unwilling to consent to the treatment.<\/p> <p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<\/p> <p>Work is also under way on drawing up a disability\/equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to progress the outstanding miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  The Bill will address issues such as the convention's requirements regarding reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  We recently presented the general scheme of the Bill to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>To address Senator Dolan's point about resources for implementation, let me be clear: we need more resources for disability as disability services have taken a hit in the past seven or eight years.  The Government and I will do our best to deliver on that.  My priorities are clear.  Underlining this Government's commitment to the disability sector, I announced last week the provision of an additional &euro;31 million for disability services in 2016.  This includes &euro;3 million for new initiatives, including an additional provision for services to meet the needs of school leavers with disabilities and the anticipated cost of a number of emergency residential placements arising this year.  These are the issues I found when I took office.  These were the priority issues that had to be dealt with immediately.  However, ratification of the convention is a separate issue that is not contingent on resources and does not require additional funding.  When we ratify the convention by the end of this year, we will be making a solemn commitment to the international community that our body of domestic legislation is fully in line with the convention and fully meets the standards required under the convention.<\/p> <p>Issues around the allocation of resources will always be subject to debate and are a matter for the individual Departments involved. Service standards and funding are subject to what the convention describes as \"progressive realisation\" and to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.  It is my job to push for those budgetary decisions and those services.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government sets out a range of commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Government supports - and I will be monitoring the position with regard to the 2017 Estimates, on which I have already started work - an increase in disability benefit and disability allowance, carer's benefit and carer's allowance and the blind person's pension.  I am committed to implementing those policies.  Legislation is being drafted to introduce a new mobility scheme, which I will have ready in the next couple of weeks, and the Government supports further increases in the housing adaption grants.  <\/p> <p>Work will continue on moving people with disabilities who are living in congregated settings to appropriate accommodation where they can live independently.  I take this opportunity to announce that additional funding of &euro;20 million will be made available to facilitate the removal of people from congregated settings.  I will supply a list of the institutions that will benefit from that &euro;20 million later.  The money in question will enable people with intellectual or physical disabilities who are living in institutions to move to appropriate accommodation.  In other words, we will take them out of institutions and put them in smaller community homes with a maximum of four people and with the necessary support staff and services.  That &euro;20 million will be spent in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Dolan for raising this issue.  I would like to change the mindset in that when we talk about people with disabilities we are talking about our daughters, brothers, sisters or neighbours.  We are talking about citizens of this State and protecting their rights.  I am determined that this UN convention will be ratified by Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#C00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>That was a fulsome response.

That is important and should be noted, but I did not hear a response to the third question I asked about an assurance to the effect that resources will be made available in the coming budget to start next year.  The reply is shy in terms of referencing the coming year.  It is critical that once we get over the hurdle of ratifying the convention that there is not another delay that would mean we would have to start thinking about resourcing.  That must be done now.<\/p> <p>In regard to ratification, I do not accept the Minister of State's point that there are no implications for resourcing.

I am giving assurances to Senator Dolan this morning in the House that we have to have done it and we have to have the resources to fund the new services.  Moreover, my position is that we have to have the resources to catch up on the damage that was done in the past nine or ten years.

I am keen to broaden this debate.  Every Minister should have a role in dealing with the issue and supporting the rights of people with disabilities to access services.  For example, I have set myself a target.  The target for employment is 3% but I have set myself a target of 6% in the next three years in respect of people with disabilities.  There are thousands of young people with a physical or intellectual disability.  I met a group of them yesterday at the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I met another group three weeks ago in the Central Remedial Clinic.  These are brilliant talented young people with physical disabilities and they are looking for a job - I am referring to a real job.  I am putting it to every Minister that it is not simply a question of Finian McGrath being the person dealing with disabilities.  We all have a responsibility.  I would appreciate the support of my Seanad colleagues for that vision.

The Minister of State may not be aware but these lands became subject to an agreement with the redress scheme and the religious order in question.  There is some concern that this process has not been completed and that the full transfer of these lands or the conditions of the agreement in respect of these lands entered into by the HSE and the landowners is in question.  While the project is progressing, contracts are being drawn up and tendering processes are being pursued, we want to avoid a situation whereby there is an issue relating to the ownership of the site.  Clearly the State cannot fund and resource a facility on lands in respect of which the title or ownership is not clear.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister of State to use his office to expedite this, take up the issue with the religious order in question and get reassurances.  Ultimately, State investment and money is going into this project.  It would be a terrible shame to have an obstacle relating to these issues at the last minute.<\/p> <p>I am not privy to the finer detail, although I have an idea of what was going on.  Anyway, whatever commitments were given and whatever the conditions, let them be carried out to the letter of the agreement in order that we can get this project under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#D00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his warm welcome and I congratulate him on his election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position with regard to this major capital investment development.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital provides a comprehensive range of specialist services to adult and paediatric patients who, as a result of accident or injury, have acquired physical disability and require specialist medical attention.  Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of disciplines to meet the particular needs of individuals.  I agree with the comments of the Senator on the excellent staff working there.  The objective is to assist with returning to life in the community with confidence.  Approximately 1,000 people are treated on an inpatient basis at the hospital each year.  Approximately 5,000 people are treated on an outpatient basis.  Many patients have a lifelong association with the hospital.  Therefore, the completion of the new national rehabilitation hospital is the priority project in the rehabilitation medicine sector.<\/p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has awarded planning permission for a 120 replacement bed ward block.  It will include support therapies to paediatrics and acquired brain injury units as well as a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall.

Procurement of construction contractors has commenced and within the next week a notice will be advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i>requesting expressions of interest for suitable contractors.  The NRH should be in a position to appoint a contractor at year end, with construction proper commencing in early 2017.  On this basis the new facility could be completed in 2018.  A small enabling works contract will commence in quarter 3 of this year and will be complete by the end of the year.  The hospital is externally accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities.  The commission sets standards of quality by which an organisation providing rehabilitation services is assessed and measured in the delivery and development of medical rehabilitation services.  The Government is committed to the development of the facilities at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  I look forward to the work commencing in the near future and to the completion of a new national rehabilitation hospital.<\/p><p>I take the point made by Senator Boyhan in respect of the ownership of the site and the conditions of the agreement.  That is something we have to be careful about.  Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of lack of clarity over the lands and title.

Tuam is certainly on the map at the moment.<\/p> <p>There has been speculation that the primary care centre in Monksland in south County Roscommon could be moved from the Galway, Mayo and Roscommon community health organisation, CHO, area 2, to CHO area 8, which covers Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth and Meath.  This is a different province.  Roscommon has no political mandate on the HSE in the CHO area 8.  The councillors in Roscommon, Paddy Kilduff, Tony Ward and Laurence Fallon are involved on HSE west.  A decision to move Roscommon to CHO area 8 would create a democratic deficit and take away the voice of the people of Roscommon in their health affairs.<\/p> <p>The HSE has advised that it is currently reviewing how community services can be best delivered locally to communities in an integrated way.  It is not in the best interests of the people of south County Roscommon who have their primary needs looked after in south Roscommon in the purpose-build HSE west primary care centre.  To move it into another administrative district may make sense to faceless bureaucrats who want to tear Roscommon apart at every opportunity - the save Roscommon campaign continues to seek to stop the proposed boundary review commission changes.  This does not make sense to the people in south County Roscommon who want a health service in their locality.  I also seek the Minister of State's support in ensuring that Roscommon is not divided.  It is a form of apartheid to take a progressive region away from Roscommon and move it into Westmeath.  It is an outrageous proposal and I hope the Minister of State, through his involvement in government, will ensure that does not happen.<\/p> <p>The whole ethos of primary care is that it be local health care.  Primary care comprises all the health and social services in the community outside hospital.  It includes GPs, public health nurses and a range of other services and provides a single point of contact to the health system.  There has been significant investment in this centre at Monksland.  Services have been centralised from throughout Roscommon to this primary care centre at Monksland.  While it may be speculation, sometimes speculation becomes reality.  Along with all other Oireachtas Members from the Roscommon-Galway constituency I was approached about this issue and it is only right that I should put it before the House and seek a response from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#E00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Leyden for his kind words and welcome to this Chamber.

I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is elsewhere on Government business.<\/p> <p>The development of an enhanced primary care system and guaranteeing the future sustainability of GP practices in rural and disadvantaged urban areas are priorities under the programme for Government and an important element in the health reform process.  Our ultimate goal is to ensure that people get the care they need as close to home as possible and that they have access to a greater range of health and social care services in their communities.<\/p> <p>Following the decision in 2013 to organise the country&rsquo;s acute hospitals into a number of hospital groups, the HSE was requested to review the structures then in place for the delivery of non-acute services.  A thorough review was commenced in 2013 and completed in 2014.  This examined international experience regarding the implementation of integrated health and social care, with a particular focus on achieving successful integration.  The review also involved consultation with providers and users of health services, as well as the public services including the local authority, education and justice systems.<\/p> <p>The review rigorously evaluated options, taking into account the requirement for appropriate care pathways between primary care and acute services, the planned hospital groups and local authority boundaries.  It also focused on what would benefit the provision of integrated care to the general population and support the implementation of Government policy on the care of older people, people with disabilities and those in need of mental health services.  The review concluded that achieving integrated care means that services must be planned and delivered with patients' needs and wishes as the organising principle and that integrated care can make a real difference to the quality of care and hence patient outcomes.  After a careful evaluation of options, the recommended approach was to restructure the 17 integrated service areas into nine community health care organisations, CHOs.<\/p> <p>The HSE has, since 2014, been proceeding with a detailed implementation plan which positions primary care at the centre of delivering services and will see the establishment of around 90 primary care networks of health and social care professionals, each serving a common population of approximately 50,000 people.<\/p> <p>It is very important to stress that, from the point of view of people using the wide range of services provided by the HSE at community level, the management structures which overlay these should be of little or no consequence.  The objective is to ensure that services are responsive to people&rsquo;s needs and enable them to receive a joined-up service that results in the most favourable health outcomes for patients.  The HSE has indicated that the Monksland primary care centre is currently located in CHO area 2, which covers Mayo, Galway and Roscommon and that no decision has been made to transfer this centre to CHO area 8.<\/p> <p>I understand that four GPs are based in the centre and that other services based there include public health nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, social work, psychology and mental health services.  Other services use the centre for clinics.  This is very much in line with the policy of Government whereby we want people to be able to access the majority of their health care needs in the community, and as far as possible in one location.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#E00400","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's statement that the HSE has indicated that the Monksland primary care centre is currently located in CHO area 2 and that no decision has been made to transfer this centre to CHO area 8.

I would have much more faith in dealing with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Taoiseach or any member of the Government than dealing with the HSE.

I raise in that context the issue of primary care centres.  In 2012, the then Minister for Health, then Deputy and now Senator Reilly, announced 35 primary care centres in locations throughout the country.  In a written reply in December 2015, the progress made in getting the primary care centres which the Government had promised just three years earlier can be described as poor at the very best.  One of the primary care centres the Minister had committed to building in 2012 was in Crumlin-Drimnagh, in my constituency.  The reply received regarding the primary care centre for Crumlin-Drimnagh was, \"Planning not completed in timeframe for PPP\".  This explanation is shocking, that the Government would commit to building a primary care centre and would allow a situation to arise in which the planning was not completed in the timeframe for a public private partnership.  It is unacceptable.  The residents of Crumlin and Kimmage are not alone.  A primary care centre was promised for Knocklyon and Rathfarnham, and the explanation for the fact that it had not progressed was also \"Planning not completed in timeframe for PPP\".  When communities are promised something as important as a primary care centre, it should be honoured, or the basis for not proceeding should be much better than the fact that planning was not completed in a certain timeframe.  It should not be the case that these announcements are done as a public relations stunt for the relevant Minister or Department and are then forgotten about.  I call on the Minister for Health to review the 2012 commitments made and provide an honest appraisal of what progress has been made, what progress he expects to be made over the coming years and what primary care centres announced in 2012 will be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that we continue to engage in debates that are classed as statements.

We had hoped it would be moved on very quickly.  We saw a D&aacute;il committee being set up almost immediately to consider reform of the way in which the D&aacute;il functioned.  We have been calling for this to happen in the Seanad and for the 42 newly elected Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; to be part of that process.  We understand, obviously, that other groupings have asked for different debates on Seanad reform, but the fact that we want a committee to be set up which would include not more than 20 other Members of the Seanad and the Cathaoirleach to consider this issue is extremely important.  It is important that we be seen to take leadership on the issue of Seanad reform.  It was never intended to be a committee that would go on <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  We envisage a finite timescale of a few weeks in order that reviews of Standing Orders could be undertaken.  It is quite clear to me from speaking to everybody, all Senators, old and new, that there is a sense that we really need to review Standing Orders as quickly as possible to do whatever we can within our remit through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, etc.  I will not, therefore, call for an amendment to the Order of Business at this point, but I may do so tomorrow if we do not have some clarification as to when the motion might be debated and moved forward.<\/p><p>I also call for a debate on the fishing industry in Ireland.  I note that my colleague, Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP, has met the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, on the issue of super trawlers.  She has raised the possibility of banning them from our waters because of the impact they are having on the domestic industry and the fact that there is a sense that there is very little regulation and that they do not seem to be inspected as much as those in the indigenous industry.  There was also an Oireachtas joint committee report on sustaining rural and coastal communities which made some fantastic recommendations on fisheries and the maintenance of rural communities.  It had cross-party agreement and is something we could bring forward and discuss again.  The issue of fisheries agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iascaireachta ar fud an ch&oacute;sta would, therefore, be the subject of a very important debate for us to have as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#H00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Yesterday the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny met the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It was interesting that there was a discussion on the commitment in the programme for Government to equality-proofing and gender-proofing of the budgetary process.  In the commitment to new politics about which we have been hearing one of the key matters is reform of the way in which budgets are compiled, as well as the budgetary process, of which the commitment to equality-proofing and gender-proofing is part.  I again ask the Leader to make sure this House will have a role to play in contributing to that new process and the shaping of a stronger commitment to equality and gender-proofing within the budgetary process.  I am keen to know how he might see this House contributing to that process.  I also ask him to recommend that the National Women's Council of Ireland which, of course, has key expertise in gender-proofing be involved in this regard.  We have seen in the health sector which has been discussed in this House this week that pilot health schemes have shown positive outcomes for men and women when a gender analysis is brought to bear.  Again, these measures would be very useful in the budgetary process.<\/p> <p>I also urge the House to consider the role it might play in strengthening the application of the public duty on equality and human rights, something all Departments are required to implement, again as part of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's founding legislation.  I would like to see if it could be attached to the legislation.  We have new legislation going through the House and it would be useful to see how it has been considered in terms of the public duty on equality and human rights.

I would welcome legislation to deal with both.  <\/p> <p>The first issue I wish to address is that of Japanese knotweed.  It is a dire problem which has been encountered in Europe since the 1800s.  It is an issue the Cathaoirleach raised in the House last year.  The plant grows at a rate of 8 in. per day.  Across Britain it has destroyed houses, causing 200,000 people to move out of their homes and making their houses worthless.  In this country, in Kenmare Community Hospital, it cost &euro;100,000 to have it eradicated.  The cost of clearing it from the grounds of the London Olympics ran to an astonishing &pound;70 million.  It poses a serious threat to the construction industry in this country which is only getting back on its feet.  It cannot be burned or eliminated by being cut.  It needs a particular intervention, which we are not seeing.  For the first time I have seen on the back of the product Roundup, a weedkiller, an application to tackle it.  However, we need a national policy to deal with it.  We need the Minister to come into the House to discuss the matter and legislate because, as matters stands, it is only due to the goodwill of people working in local authorities, hedge-cutters, etc., that the position is not worse.  We also need an awareness and education campaign in order that people can recognise it and will know how to deal with it.<\/p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is that of ash dieback, a disease which has only been present in this country since 2006.  It is an aggressive disease which is easily spread by airborne spores.  A survey in 2013 found that there were 46 cases in Ireland.  By the end of 2015 there had been 200 discoveries.  The disease is prevalent in two counties, probably the best hurling counties in the country, namely, Tipperary and Kilkenny.  Funnily enough, it is also prevalent in County Leitrim, even though hurling is not played there.  On a more serious note, the disease could spread across the country and without any intervention will destroy the hurley-making business.  I was surprised to discover that 350,000 hurleys were made per year in Ireland, at an average cost of &euro;30 per hurley.  That makes it a &euro;10 million industry.  We, therefore, need to tackle the spread of the plant.  Teagasc has done some work on the issue and held a number of awareness campaigns and public meetings, but the problem is that the Department's reconstitution scheme, as it is called, only protects forestry and foresters.  There is no facility to assist the smaller guy who might have planted a small number of ash trees.  Therefore, the problem is prone to spread across the country.  Yesterday the Vice President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden, began his visit to this country and, as is the norm, was presented with an ash hurley by the Taoiseach.  This week in Limerick, in an intermediate hurling game, six of the players on the field used plastic hurleys.  Therefore, if we do not do something about the problem, the next time a Head of State or a vice president comes to the country, it is a plastic hurley he or she will be given instead of one made of ash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#H00400","speaker":"1387"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of obesity, on which matter there has been much discussion.

Antibiotics were the medical miracle of the 20th century and were used as an essential part of everyday health care treatment.  Unfortunately, they have been overused in recent times, being overprescribed at GP and hospital levels, often under pressure from patients.  It has happened to such an extent that many bugs have become resistant to them.  This issue must be addressed.

Similar to this is the eradication of vending machines in schools, in particular those machines that contain junk food.  The idea that they are in our hospitals goes against the grain.  This is a wider issue.  The health service is struggling to supply good health care with relatively small budgets in many instances, but our approach to health is ridiculous in many ways.  We must consider the foundation years and take care of people when they are vulnerable.  Children in schools could be looked after via vending machines that dispense apples or the like.  This would help them realise at a young age that food is fuel and will make them healthy.  Vending machines that dispense chocolate bars, crisps and Coke should not be introduced.  Everyone loves to have those foods occasionally, but if they are being eaten regularly, they create a significant problem.  Senator Colm Burke was right.  There is a problem with our general approach to hospitals.  This is a major issue and I support the Senator in his call.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of alcohol consumption, harm and costs.  Today, a new report by the Health Research Board, HRB, highlighted a large number of statistics that I have before me but that I will not go through on the Order of Business.  The impact of alcohol-related issues on our health is serious, although I sound like a killjoy discussing all of these issues on the Order of Business.  The report highlighted that the rate of alcoholic liver disease trebled between 1995 and 2013.  The report makes various points regarding the impact on our health, of which I will mention a couple.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The number of people discharged from hospital whose condition was fully attributable to alcohol increased by 82% between 1995 and 2013, from 9,420 to 17,120.

In 2013, alcohol related discharges accounted for 160,210 bed days in public hospitals.  Alcohol related issues cost the taxpayer &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  I could speak about this issue for an entire day.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister come to the House as soon as possible and progress the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  Minimum pricing will help because there is a clear correlation between the price of alcohol and the amount people drink.

Under the law, households located in urban conglomerations with a population of more than 1,500 have been required to separate waste since July 2015.  As such, all households in such locations have been required for the past year to have brown bins for food and organic waste such as garden cuttings.  However, tens of thousands of homes have not been provided with brown bins and cannot, therefore, comply with the law.  When asked about this, the waste collection companies frequently state they do not have the capacity to provide brown bins.  When they are informed that they are required to provide them, they ask householders to contact their local authority.  Householders then discover that their local authority is not enforcing the regulations, which means they cannot comply with the law.  In one week from now, many more households in many more towns with a population of more than 500 will find they are not in compliance with the law on brown waste.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding the deal the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties have done to kick this issue down the road for another year, will the Leader ensure the Minister comes to the House to explain how he proposes to address the non-compliance of a large number of householders with the waste regulations and the inability, from next week onwards, of tens of thousands more to comply with the law and make a contribution to our European and internationally agreed environmental targets?  If, as appears likely, the Government side proposes to vote against the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion, will the Leader set out what the Government proposes to do to address this serious issue?

I request a debate on the location of the national children's hospital, an issue that has been raised previously in the House.  While An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made its determination and granted planning permission for the hospital, neither House has debated the location for the new hospital which will require public investment of &euro;1 billion.  The D'Alton report of 2012 suggested the cost of building the facility at the St. James's Hospital site would be 25% higher than building it on a greenfield site.  These issues of public expenditure issues need to be debated at the Joint Committee on Health and I suggest the Seanad also debate the location selected for the hospital.<\/p> <p>Many commentators and experts, including children's organisations and medical experts, have outlined their concerns about this issue and their voices should be heard because not only have they not been heard, but they have been diminished.  The reason given by the Health Service Executive and Department for locating the national children's hospital at St. James's Hospital is that it will deliver better clinical outcomes.  There is no scientific evidence to back up this claim.  Major questions have been asked about this substantial investment of taxpayers' money.  The alternative sites available would provide comparable or better clinical outcomes and they should be explored.

I raised this issue yesterday when I had a brief window to do so during statements on health.  Given the severity of the issue, however, it is worthy of a much more substantial discussion.  Many Senators have raised issues connected with health this morning.  To be fair to the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of Health, they do not appear to be reluctant to come to the House.  We should utilise this willingness to the fullest.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to the phrase, \"your health is your wealth\".  My teacher at Me&aacute;nscoil Feirste, Brendan &Oacute; Fiach, had the saying written as Gaeilge - is fearr an tsl&aacute;inte n&aacute; na t&aacute;inte - on the blackboard of our classroom.  It is very true, as was evident in some of the contributions we heard.  The Leader will be aware that the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North, Michelle O'Neill MLA, recently lifted the MSM blood ban prohibiting gay men from donating blood.  Many Senators will have heard the Irish Blood Transfusion Service appeal for blood donations over the summer when donations tend to decline.  Given the many issues that have been raised relating to what is, as everyone appreciates, a very broad field, one of the core issues at the heart of the health service is its ability to help people and save lives.  This means enfranchising people by enabling them to give the gift of life through blood donations.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to come before the House to discuss this issue?  The North-South Ministerial Council is due to meet soon.  Given the evidence based decision taken by the Minister for health in the North, I hope the Minister for Health here will be able to make a similar decision as we move towards equality and better health care provision in this State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#K00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#K00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>The Cathaoirleach caught me on the hop.  I thank Senators for raising the issue and apologise to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for missing his remarks on mortgages and insolvency.

It was announced recently that 14 new primary care centres were to be built using investment secured through a loan from the European Investment Bank.  Under the previous Government, 90 primary care centres came into operation and a further 82 are to be opened.  We all agree on the need to expand primary care because it is the most important element of the health system.  The Senator will not find anyone willing to argue with her on that issue.  She may wish to table a commencement matter on the sites to which she referred.  I will also raise the issue with the Minister on her behalf.  She is correct that primary care is very important.  We must shift the emphasis towards primary care in regard to funding and resourcing and how the population view the issue.  <\/p> <p>A number of other Senators also raised health issues and I will refer individually to the matters raised by Senators Burke, Noone and Gallagher.<\/p> <p>Senators Craughwell, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Norris raised the issue of reform.

I have made the point in this House that we should establish a business committee, similar to the D&aacute;il, whereby we can run business efficiently and effectively.  Thus, Members would have their say and we could conduct our business in a better fashion.  That is not an issue on our side.<\/p><p>The Sinn F&eacute;in motion puts an added and unfair onus on the role of the Cathaoirleach.  He is independent of all of us, as the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, but the motion, as presently constituted, does not allow for same.  A committee comprised of 20 Members would be too cumbersome and one third of the Seanad is new.  The CPP is the vehicle and forum where we can drive change, make amendments to Standing Orders and provides cross representation of all of the House, which is the way we should do things.  We should not stipulate timelines that will not and cannot be met.<\/p><p>The Manning report is one that we have all subscribed to.  Senator McDowell has moved his Bill.  I am happy to allow for his legislation to be taken at a time when we can have the discussion that would bring about change.

I hope that he will attend here for a debate.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of fisheries.  I have already spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and he is happy to come to the House, sometime in July, to have a broad discussion on agriculture.  On that occasion we can include fisheries in the discussion.    <\/p> <p>In terms of legislation, if people listened to this morning's debate they would know that the very first act that we took here, apart from the election of the Cathaoirleach, was to restore Bills to the Order Paper.  There is a deficit of legislation in the other House.  When we talk about new politics one of its by-products is that there is, as mentioned by Senator Craughwell, a lot of hot air and discussion, for the want of an expression.  Whether that is positive or negative is a different matter.  How we do business and arrive at legislation is one that needs to be looked at by everybody, including the commentariat.  One of the positives of pre-legislative scrutiny is that we engage in an in-depth analysis of legislation, which slows the process down.  To be fair to Senator Mac Lochlainn, he was a very fine contributor to the justice committee of the last D&aacute;il in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny.  There are no kudos for being involved in pre-legislative scrutiny but it is the way to go, as I know from my own position on the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  As a House of the Oireachtas, we must acknowledge that legislation will slow down and that the volume of legislation may be less than what existed before.  <\/p> <p>Senator Landy raised the issues of Japanese knotweed and ash dieback disease.  I am happy to invite the relevant Minister to debate both matters in this House but I am not sure whether it comes within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. <\/p> <p>Senators Colm Burke and Catherine Noone raised the important issue of obesity and the availability of vending machines.  The HSE's health and well-being division had an expert group on vending and calorie posting carry out work on the matter.  The results are important because they show that 37% of us are overweight and 23% of us are obese.  We are, as a nation, in danger of seeing premature deaths from obesity and of work hours being lost.  Linked to all of that, the findings show that there is a risk that young people, in particular children, will be obese from a younger age and may never leave the category.  The former Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, introduced a vending policy and calorie posting.  It is important in the context of a discussion that both Senators Burke and Noone requested, and we should have that discussion.  The Department and the HSE has now, as part of their policy, promoted the message that this is about choice so make yours a healthy one, which forms part of the vending machines that are located in hospitals.  The Senators were right to raise the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher also raised the issue of health in terms of over prescription.  I agree with him that we need such a debate.  <\/p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of seagulls.  I do not know who would be the appropriate Minister for such a discussion.  The issue relates to matters of health, the environment, tourism and the economic but I am happy to categorise all of those elements into just one.  <\/p> <p>Senator Norris raised the issue of the \"Oireachtas Report\".  At the risk of causing a row, if we do not give the \"Oireachtas Report\" items to report then it may not necessarily report them.  I agree with him that the \"Oireachtas Report\" should include all of the Oireachtas, be it the committee, the D&aacute;il Chamber or the Seanad.  Yesterday, we had a fine debate on health and we also had statements.  This morning some of the newspapers reported that there was a minute's silence in the D&aacute;il for the late Jo Cox but failed to mention that we had the same in the Seanad.  That shows there is a need to have a discussion with the press office in the Oireachtas.  The Senator made a fair point.<\/p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn made an interesting and valid point about brown bins.  I suggest he raise the matter with the Minister tonight during our debate or table a Commencement matter.  The Senator is right that it is an important matter.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of the national children's hospital.  We have had this discussion since before Bertie Ahern's time to now.  An independent review group was established and clearly outlined its choice of location.  I was Chair of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and other Members of this House were on the committee.  We, as a committee, visited the hospital group and met the board of the national children's hospital.  The visit was very positive.  The issues have been debated and more issues have been raised about the children's hospital.  Independent planning was done by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which refused one site but granted the current site.  Similarly, a review group has been established and a site has been located.  It behoves us now, in Ireland's first digital hospital and first national children's hospital, is to make sure that the venture is a success.  I am sure the Minister is happy to come here to debate the matter.  The Senator may not be happy with his response.  This has been a well-worn long debated argument.  The policy decision was arrived at independently and a final location has been selected.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the health issue of blood donation.  There has been a change in the blood donation policy in the North, which is welcome.  I hope that the Minister for Health in the South will follow suit and make a positive change.  We have been involved with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the matter has been discussed by the health committee.  It is important that we have a change and there is equality.  <\/p> <p>I join with all of the other Senators who have raised the issue in wishing the Irish soccer team good luck tonight.  It is important that we get a result, not just for the team but for the well-being of the nation.  I also pay tribute to the Irish fans who have been a source of pride to us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#L00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466587800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466587800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.20 p.m. and resumed at 12.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mental Health: Statements","time":1466587800,"counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#O00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have been appointed to this position.

The stigma is still there, and while we have made great progress during the past decade, we still have a long way to go.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There has been much discussion recently on the funding of mental health, some of which has been constructive but some of which has not.  I will outline a number of the facts.  The national service plan mental health budget for 2016 is &euro;826 million.  Since 2012, the plan's budget has increased by &euro;115 million.  This year, there will be an increase of &euro;41 million, or 5.2%, on the outturn last year.  The number of child and adolescent community mental health teams and acute inpatient beds have increased substantially while waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have decreased, and initiatives are under way to reduce them further.  We have to understand that there is a great deal of work to do in these areas as well.<\/p><p>In broad terms, we have facilitated the move away from institutional care to community care, providing service users with more accessible treatment in better environments.  We have closed many of the older psychiatric hospital inpatient units, providing new, improved facilities such as The Phoenix Care Centre, the new acute unit in Cork University Hospital and those due to open shortly in Galway and Drogheda.  Preliminary site work has also commenced on the new state-of-the-art national forensic hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  We have helped to foster a greater awareness of mental health promotion in society through campaigns such as Little Things, while the suicide prevention strategy, Connecting For Life, has helped to increase awareness of suicide in society.  While much good work has taken place in recent years, I am under no illusion that more work and further effort is required.  We need, for example, to continue development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care.  We need more community mental health teams, together with improved 24-7 response and liaison services.  Most important, we need to ensure no group, regardless of age, ethnicity, sexuality or circumstances, is left behind or overlooked.  Changes initiated as a result of new funding allocated by the previous Government have paved the way for real and lasting change for service users and we need to build on that.<\/p><p>The national mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, is ten years old this year.  Within the next 100 days, I will initiate an evidence-based expert review of progress in the implementation of this policy and in the improvement of mental health services.  The review will take account of international best practice in the area of mental health and will inform how we will develop our policy.<\/p><p>Perhaps the main challenge to the mental health service is the recruitment and retention of staff.  Many well-trained, highly motivated people are taking up employment outside the public service, either in the private sector or abroad.  I touched on this yesterday with a number of Senators.  I am conscious of the difficulty in recruiting and retaining nurses in the mental health area.  For that reason, I am happy to inform Senators that the HSE is reintroducing a one-year post-registration programme in psychiatric nursing for nurses who are registered in either the general, intellectual disability or children's divisions of the register maintained by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  A total of 30 places have been made available on the programme which is due to commence in autumn 2016 in association with UCD.  While this is a positive move, there is a great deal of work to do, and further recruitment of staff within the HSE requires change, for which I intend to push.<\/p><p>We live in an evolving world.  While we can communicate with people more quickly, in many ways, perhaps, we are becoming more isolated due to the pace of our daily lives and the pressures we are under.  Our pace of life is getting faster.  This puts people under pressure and in need of assistance.  The need to reform and to update our mental health policy and services is clear.  We need to plan for this but also address changes happening now.  Education is key and is most important at an early stage.  Mental health issues often manifest at a much younger age than we like to think about or even discuss, but that is today&rsquo;s reality.  The pressures that young people face today compared with when any of us was in school are completely different.  Every second of a young person&rsquo;s life is online, and while it is visible for everybody to see, it is also visible for everybody to criticise - what they look like, how they dress, who their friends are, who they hang out with, where they go to school and how they do in exams.  There is a different dimension to young people&rsquo;s lives that was not there a few years ago and we need to start dealing with it.<\/p><p>In the next 100 days, I will establish a youth mental health task force.  I am actively working on this.  The task force will consider how best to assist young people in developing resilience and coping skills to support their emotional well-being at an early stage, and to build awareness of how to access high-quality effective services when they need them.  The task force will comprise a number of non-political, non-governmental members with significant expertise in the area of youth mental health and will be supported by a significant cross-departmental effort to establish a new, co-ordinated way of working across government to advance youth mental health and well-being.  This will be a critical aspect of our work.  The mental wellness and well-being of young people is not simply a health issue and it should not relate specifically to the Department of Health.  It is not simply an education issue either.  It is an economic, social and community issue that requires the public, private and voluntary sectors and all of us to co-ordinate and pull together in order that our efforts combined achieve more than the sum of their parts and in order that every young person has the full support of the community they live in to reach their full potential.<\/p><p>I refer again to the marriage equality referendum last year.  This was not mental health legislation but it had a massively positive impact on the mental health of many people.  We need to identify the everyday issues that affect young people&rsquo;s well-being and, as a community and as a society, and we need to equip them with the tools to deal with them effectively.<\/p><p>I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute and I am here to listen to what Members have to say.  I will take on board what they say and, I hope, work them with them into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#O00200","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment and I wish her the best in her important role.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I would like to outline our message on mental health.  Mental health issues continue silently to inflict immense damage on our country.  The undercurrent of depression, anxiety and addiction is a profoundly ingrained problem for society, and no family is untouched by mental health issues.  Beyond the striking statistics regarding suicide rates, the affliction of depression exacts a heavy toll on the day-to-day lives of very many people.  We have successfully confronted dangerous challenges such as this.  The spike in road fatalities that endangered a generation of motorists was tackled head on with the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, increased investment, the penalty points system and so on, and significant numbers of lives were saved annually.  We need a similar concerted national approach to the devastating impact of mental health issues.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in an Ard-Fheis speech a number of years ago referred to the setting up of a mental health authority.  If the Government set up such an authority with the same funding and emphasis as, for example, the RSA, it could prove similarly effective.<\/p> <p>As a republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il believes mental health policy is, ultimately, a question of citizenship.  We believe people with mental health problems must be brought in from the periphery to the centre and encouraged and enabled to give full expression to their citizenship through employment, social engagement and the opportunity to contribute to their communities.  As citizens, people with such problems have the right to equality of access and the full range of modern, cost-effective and therapeutically impactful treatments and not to be bound to the classic services of the past.  Access to services must not be dependent on where people live or their earnings.  The citizenship approach dovetails well with the recovery model of mental health care whereby recovery is built on a partnership approach between the person and his or her mental health care team.  The model moves away from the paternalistic psychiatrist model of the past and towards a more multidisciplinary co-operative approach.  The recovery model recognises that treatment is not merely about the alleviation of symptoms but about working with the person to ensure he or she can live a productive and meaningful life, despite the vulnerabilities that may continue to exist.  They should be equipped with the skills, self-understanding and resources to help prevent relapse.<\/p> <p>Flowing from that is the vision that mental health is a whole of society concern given its prevalence and its impact on individuals, their families, communities and employment.  Mental health policy should be aimed primarily at preventative measures, early action when problems begin to surface and early intervention with children and their families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This approach must extend beyond the health system and be integrated with all aspects of life, including education, planning, employment and communities.  The ultimate aim is to create a mentally healthy society.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il's vision for mental health and well being is built on five key principles.  First, public policy ought to ensure people with mental health problems are included in society and enabled and assisted in playing their part therein.  Second, the recovery model of mental health care is the most appropriate in terms of individuals' well being and enhancing and defending citizenship.  Third, mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health in the deployment of resources, health and safety measures and public planning.  Fourth, the emphasis should be on early intervention and early action, as the Minister of State mentioned.  Fifth, mental health policy must be mainstreamed across society in order to promote mental well-being and reduce the risk of mental ill health.<\/p><p>We need to enhance the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, increase the number of suicide prevention resource officers, expand their role and link them directly with the NOSP.  We must ensure all general practitioners, GPs, are adequately resourced to provide comprehensive help for individuals at risk of dying by suicide.  A system of GP practice must be put in place whereby the prescribing of anti-depressant medication must be reviewed on a monthly basis until the GP is satisfied that the taking of medication is the best course of action.  We must establish out-of-hours emergency social worker teams across the State.<\/p><p>Regarding Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, the principle of early intervention is critical, as properly addressing mental health problems in early childhood and the adolescent years leads to better educational outcomes, avoids severe mental health issues later, improves quality of life and is more cost effective than later treatment.  We need to end the practice of placing children in adult inpatient units and should focus on holistic and accessible services that minimise the use of inpatient beds.  The provision of counselling and a seamless integration with schools and education policy must also be central to plans.  Within schools, all teachers should receive mental health training so as to equip them to identify, support and refer children with mental health problems.  We must restore guidance counsellors to secondary schools; every school should have a named CAMHS worker and all children should have access to counselling services through their schools.  We would anticipate a universal health check being carried out when children receive their booster vaccinations in sixth class or first year in secondary school.  This check would include a mental health assessment to identify developing or existing mental health problems, thus allowing for early and efficient treatment.<\/p><p>We all know that this is a major issue.  It affects every family in the country, every neighbourhood, every community and every workplace.  We must ensure we will do everything possible to improve the service provided.  I wish the Minister of State well in her role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#P00200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and wish her well in her brief.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about the issue of suicide, particularly in the context of the position in my constituency of Limerick City.  Studies have shown that, between 2011 and 2013, it had the highest suicide rate in Ireland.  At more than 21 deaths per 100,000 of population, the rate was almost twice the national average.  The most recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office show that there has been a decrease to 16 deaths per 100,000 of population, but the rate is not decreasing among men.  In 2015, 2014 and 2010 the figure in Limerick was nearly 29 men per 100,000 of population.  In 2015 the figure for females was 3.5, although in 2014 it was very high, at 17.3.  It was nil in 2010.<\/p> <p>I want these issues to be addressed.  We are attending too many funerals of people who died by suicide.  It is a national emergency.  More people die by suicide than in car accidents, yet there is considerable reporting, justifiably so, of deaths on the roads.  Deaths by suicide must receive the same level of concentration.<\/p> <p>Studies have shown that 70% of young males know of someone who died by suicide.  For 17% of them, it was a close friend.  We must address this issue.  A further feature of the statistics is that 60% of people who die by suicide are 44 years or younger.  They are a young cohort.  This issue should be addressed in a practical way.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is carrying out a welcome review of A Vision for Change which is now ten years old.  In the context of the position in Limerick, the fact that the rates have been consistently high needs to be addressed.  A Vision for Change committed to the opening of 20 inpatient child and adolescent mental health beds in University Hospital Limerick, but that has not happened.  It must happen.  As part of the Minister of State's review, this should be a priority.  If a child or an adolescent has mental health issues, he or she will end up in an adult ward, which in the modern age is unacceptable.  Given that the levels of suicide have been consistently high in Limerick City, will the HSE or the Department carry out a specific study of the reasons for this?  There is a myriad of factors, for example, alcohol and drugs.<\/p> <p>In 2014 St. Patrick's Hospital's mental health services presented the stark result of a survey.  Some 65% of Irish people believed being treated for mental health problems was a sign of failure.  We must get rid of this taboo.  Among young males, there appears to be a fear of admitting to any mental health problem because it is seen as a sign of failure.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State discuss a suggestion with her counterpart, the Minister for Education and Skills?  As part of the curricula at primary and secondary levels and as Senator Gerry Horkan referenced, CSPE subjects should include modeules on physical and mental health and well-being which must be on a par.  This would have a major benefit, as people would feel it was not taboo and that, if they had mental health problems, they could treat them just as they could a broken leg.  We cannot afford to have 451 people dying by suicide, as we did last year.  That is the reported figure, but many suicides go unreported.<\/p> <p>As promised in A Vision for Change in 2006, 20 inpatient child and adolescent beds should be provided in University Hospital Limerick.  A study should be undertaken by the Department of Health and the HSE to discover why the suicide level in Limerick City is so high.  Mental health and well-being should be included in the curricula at primary and secondary levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#Q00600","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome.

Last year, I hosted a series of meetings with individual workers who related horror stories to me of bullying incidents and the associated impact on their mental health.  Paragraph 5 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice Detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace) (Declaration) Order 2002 describes bullying.<\/p><p>There is a huge difference between robust management and bullying in the workplace.  I recall that during my time as president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland a colleague contacted me to tell me they were suffering horrendous bullying over their timekeeping.  When I asked what the problem was with their timekeeping they said, \"Well, I am usually in by 9.05\", to which I replied that that was not really bullying but a management issue.  That is what it is all about.<\/p><p>I have looked into the eyes of the cowardly bullies.  I have seen the bullies first-hand, and the way they work.  They take the individual and destroy them psychologically.  They break them down bit by bit until they become a shadow of their former selves.  It is in the loneliness of that existence that I raise this issue in a debate on mental health.  It is when one is in one's sitting room, bedroom or dining room at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning looking into the darkness and wondering why one has found oneself in this position.  Usually, those who suffer from what I call character and personality assassination are the strongest, best workers one will find.  They are the most innovative and friendly on the staff.  They are the ones who are held in the highest esteem by colleagues, yet they are the ones who are broken down.<\/p><p>Only last week a person came to see me.  It took him two years to realise what was happening to him, and it involved sly remarks such as \"We've heard enough from you, John; we don't need to hear any more\" or \"John, don't attend the next meeting; we don't need you\" or \"John, would you stop trying to make out that that job you're doing for us is the greatest thing that ever happened\". That is what slowly brings a person down.  Sadly, I have experienced two examples of that in my lifetime.  I am convinced to this day those people took their own lives for one reason only - they had been broken by the managers they worked with, and I mean they were destroyed by them.<\/p><p>Currently, there is only a civil redress option for those affected by workplace bullying but within the criminal justice system there is legislation entitled the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  We are crossing into two Departments here, and probably three and four - perhaps we should look across all Departments - but when we talk about bullying and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act the Minister of State might work with her colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  We must put bullying onto this footing.  All of us talk about managing bullying among children in schools.  Yesterday, we had statements on the murder of the MP, Joe Cox.  Politicians in this House and in the D&aacute;il, from all parties and none, related stories of the horrendous treatment they are getting online including telephone calls or people coming into their offices and pounding the table.  That in itself is a form of bullying.  It is time we took the bully out of the equation and became a bully-free society that will not tolerate that type of attack on an individual.<\/p><p>Every person has a right to their dignity.  Every person has a right to do what it is they believe is the best by way of their work, their contribution to society or whatever else, yet we have those who would seek to destroy, and I am not talking about physical destruction but the mental destruction that takes place.  While it crosses a number of Departments, the Minister of State can take the lead on this issue and offer those who are suffering this type of horrendous treatment a lifeline by saying she will take an interest in bullying in the workplace and its effect on the mental health of the people.  If she does that, she will do the greatest service that has ever been done to those suffering from this horrendous condition.  I thank the Minister of State for her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#Q00900","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Upper House and congratulate her on her appointment as the new Minister for mental health and older people.  I believe she will take the necessary measures to address the ever-growing and pressing issues surrounding mental health.<\/p> <p>I am also encouraged to see that the Cabinet approved the restoration of the mental health funding for 2016.  Commitment was clearly shown by the previous Government and continues now with this Government in the programme for Government.  A Vision for Change provides for the ring-fencing of &euro;35 million from within the overall health budget to develop community mental health services and to ensure early access to more appropriate services for both adults and children.<\/p> <p>A key focus has been the additional posts to strengthen community mental health teams for both adults and children.  They have been used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services and increasing access to counselling and psychotherapy under the suicide prevention incentives.  Appropriately, 1,550 new posts have been approved since 2012 up to the end of 2016, of which 1,153 have been recruited or were in the recruitment process by the end of last year.  Those posts facilitate the policy of moving away from traditional institutional based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service where hospital admissions are greatly reduced while providing inpatient care when appropriate.<\/p> <p>While all of those steps are working towards a common goal in looking after the needs of those suffering with mental health difficulties, there is a very long way to go.  I will outline some key areas I believe need urgent scrutiny, together with a change in legislation, to help those most vulnerable in our society.<\/p> <p>Ireland has the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in Europe.  Suicide is everybody's problem, and one in four of us will at some stage throughout our lives suffer with mental health issues, regardless of age.  Those at local general practitioner level and staff working in accident and emergency departments are not sufficiently trained to recognise or deal with patients who present with a mental health issue.  What training is provided in this specified area?  Is that training updated, and how often is it updated?  Accident and emergency departments are not equipped to deal with a person in crisis.  Implementation of access to 24 hour, seven days a week trained crisis support is essential.<\/p> <p>I want to give another example of that.  A young man with mental health issues had been in a Dublin hospital for a medical procedure but was discharged at lunch time that same day.  That evening, he was seen by his general practitioner for a check-up and despite the fact that he was attending Pieta House, the medical professionals did not deem him to be suicidal.  That young man took his own life before the day was out.<\/p> <p>A major factor that works against those suffering with mental health issues is patient confidentiality in terms of anyone over the age of 18.  Those who have a member of their family suffering with a mental health condition understand how frustrating it is for them to have their hands tied and unable to intervene to help their loved ones due to this confidentiality provision.  In reality, we have a system whereby the family or a loved one of someone suffering with a mental health illness is not permitted to access the most basic level of information to support their loved ones.  That does not make sense at any level.  Families must be involved in the care of someone suffering with a mental health illness, and I ask the Minister to make that a priority and bring forward legislation to ensure the best possible care for all.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ray Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2303\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2303&amp;amp;pid=RayButler&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the case to which I referred, the mother involved said, &quot;As a mom looking after our son, I should have access to as much information as possible in order to keep him safe.&quot;  In my constituency I had a person with mental health issues, and her neighbours and I watched her die, maggots all over her body, her house filthy.  The HSE told us it could not do anything, bar she signing herself in.  We had to look at this, knowing what was going on behind those closed doors.<br\/><br\/>Access to counselling also needs to be a priority.  Private services are not affordable for the majority.  There are those who desperately need this assistance and shorter waiting times.  Someone who is in crisis may not always have time on his or her side.  People have been referred by the public sector to a private service as the public sector did not have specialists available.  This cost &euro;140 per session.  This is not suitable for anybody.  Sometimes there is no alternative except to endure endless waiting lists and hope and pray that loved ones are able to hold on.<br\/><br\/>I know the Minister of State's portfolio is close to her heart, and it has touched all of ours as well.  I am excited to know which changes she will bring about and I wish her every success in her new ministerial role.  I will finish with a sobering thought written by Shane Gillen:<\/p><blockquote>I am a 28 year old male in Ireland.  Some day I will die, and the chances of me dying by suicide are higher than the chances of me dying of liver disease, leukaemia, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, liver or colon cancer, kidney disease, lymphomas or from a serious injury or car crash.  Today's Ireland sees suicide ranked among the top ten killers in the land.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#R00200","speaker":"1423","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and thank all Senators for their passionate speeches and statements on mental health.  Mental health, according to the World Health Organization, is the most important public health issue.  Even every poor society must afford to promote, protect and invest in it.  Mental illness is the world's most neglected disease and the leading cause of disability worldwide.  Anyone, as previous speakers have said, can experience it.  Depression and anxiety are very common conditions and affect almost half a million people in this country.  One in four of us will be affected by depression at some point in our lives and, tragically, each year several hundred people take their lives, sending grief and shockwaves rippling out to family, friends and communities forever affected.<\/p> <p>We are a society in distress and we have a moral responsibility to demand resources to guarantee the provision of a modern mental health system to meet today's needs.  Public demand has never been so high.  Since the establishment of the State, all Governments have failed miserably in this regard.  They have no comprehension of mental distress and appear not to possess compassion, and \"compassion\" is a word we need to use repeatedly.  We lauded yesterday A Vision for Change, which takes us from the antiquated, Victorian era.  Instead, Governments have used it as a fiscal scalp to cut services without any community replacements.<\/p> <p>Many reports by the Mental Health Commission and Mental Health Reform rage against the failure of mental health services, and yesterday saw the launch of a wonderful document by the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, in Buswells Hotel.  I hope the Minister has a copy and goes through it.  It details the failure of A Vision for Change and the stark fact that the budget was drastically reduced from 14% to a measly 6%.  This is unpardonable and inexcusable.  Of the recommendations in A Vision for Change, 75% have not been implemented.  Regarding inpatient bed status, A Vision for Change was to seek community replacement of inpatient facilities.  Figures from the report show that in 1984, there were 12,500 inpatient beds, whereas in 2004 the figure went down to 4,000 and in 2015 to 1,600.  The percentage drop from 2004 to 2015 is 60%.  The budget was drastically reduced at the same time.  This document speaks of broken promises and heartbreak throughout the country.  Mental health has always been the Cinderella of the health services but it needs to be at the top of the agenda in every Government's decision and policy-making.  It needs to be a central focus of our health policy.<\/p> <p>I applaud and congratulate community groups and families.  They are standing up and are innovators in the vanguard leading the fightback to inform communities and demand the provision of appropriate care and understanding for those in their communities who are in distress.  They are the mental health advocates and warriors and are challenging attitudes and changing lives.<\/p> <p>We do not need any further reviews.  We need implementation.  We have reviews coming out our ears, so to speak.  We all know what needs to be implemented.  The will is needed to do so, and I hope the Minister of State will work with us all in this regard.<\/p> <p>On the issue of stigma, to which the Minister of State alluded in her speech, one hopeful thing was See Change's Green Ribbon campaign, which was fantastic and really well done.  It started a conversation.  If people wear the green ribbon, they are open, they want to talk about mental health and they want to disperse the stigma.  The research that See Change has done over recent years has shown that people are much more comfortable discussing mental health, so we just need to keep that going.  In addition, last week in the Mansion House there was a fantastic community-initiated report on suicide and its effects on communities and families in the Dublin 8 area.  I would love the Minister to invite the South West Inner City Network to present that report.  I would like the to be brought in here, but also to be part of the youth group that the Minister of State wants to pull together.  They speak from the heart.  It is a community initiative.  They are not professionals.  They are concerned with the matter on the ground, and Dublin 8 has seen its fair share of pain and grief.  Their report mostly speaks of the love that they have for the people they have lost.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's report and the postgraduate course to try to convert some of our nurses into specialist psychiatric nurses.  We need to tackle the concerns of the student nurses.  Their intake is 300-odd a year, with drop-outs, yet there are 1,000 vacant posts this year and we will spend 15 years trying to catch up to provide nurses to care for families in distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#S00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and wish her every success in her new role.  Minding our mental health is a constant requirement every day of our lives.  How we feel filters into everything we do and experience, from being involved in our community to having a job to meeting friends to financial stress, online criticism, feelings of inadequacy, bullying and feelings of depression.  We must ensure at all times that all people know how valued they are.  We must ensure in times of difficulty that we have someone to turn to, someone who will listen, that we are equipped with the coping mechanisms to deal with life's challenges, and above all that we have a mental health service which supports us when we need it.<\/p> <p>The Mental Health Commission's annual report for 2015 published a number of days ago clearly emphasises that much work needs to continue in developing a properly resourced community-based mental health service with a focus on prevention and recovery.  At present it is of major concern that just under half the HSE's community mental health services provide support seven days a week.  It is unacceptable that in 2016, substantial areas of the country are still without full weekend support for people with a mental health difficulty.  I very much welcome the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, today that we need more community mental health teams, together with an improved 24-7 response and liaison services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The intensive home treatment team established approximately a year ago in Roscommon works on a seven-days-per-week basis to treat more people at home.  It also allows for greater family involvement.  It has a consultant psychiatrist, an occupational therapist, a psychologist, a nurse and a social worker.  The feedback I have received from number of service users is positive, but teams such as these need to be further developed and properly resourced so that a holistic service is provided, the service user is very much at the centre of his or her own care plan and appropriate supports are provided where necessary.<\/p><p>The restoration of the &euro;35 million for mental health was absolutely necessary in light of the challenges we face in delivering a proper service.  I thank the Minister of State, along with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for ensuring its restoration.  Following publication of the report recently, the chairperson of the Mental Health Commission stated there is still a significant absence of psychology, social work, occupational therapy and other multidisciplinary team members.  There are distinct difficulties in recruiting specific professional staff despite funding being made available in 2015 for an additional 700 staff.  I welcome the focus of the Minister of State on the challenges we face regarding recruitment.  The HSE's reintroduction of a one year post-registration programme in psychiatric nursing is most welcome.  What changes will the HSE and Department of Health recommend as needing to be made to recruit increased staff for all multidisciplinary team positions?<\/p><p>I very much welcome the establishment of the youth mental health task force to which the Minister of State referred.  It is absolutely critical that, from an early age, young people have the coping skills to deal with life's challenges so that we deal with prevention rather than cure.  As the Minister of State is well aware, much urgent work needs to be done in the area of child and adolescent mental health services.  They are not properly resourced and children and adolescents are being assessed and treated at inappropriate facilities.<\/p><p>Voluntary organisations provide vital services, particularly in the context of education on mental health well-being and counselling services.  However, they need to be provided with proper funding support from the HSE.<\/p><p>I am enthusiastic about the need for a review of A Vision for Change, which the Minister of State mentioned.  It is absolutely critical that we respond to the changing demands of our society and I hope a review would allow us to plan our mental health services to respond to these needs.  I very much look forward to working with the Minister of State and I thank her for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#S00300","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I will share time with Senator Kelleher.

On a daily basis, I hear from families and family members that are finding it difficult to access mental health services.

The survey also shows that mental health difficulties are an issue of inequality.  The level of mental health problems is considerably more prevalent among people living in deprived areas, at 13%, compared with that relating to the overall population, which stands at 5%.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State can see from these facts that writing reports and not implementing them fully is costing Ireland dearly, in that we are not looking after the welfare of our people.  Many good people work hard in delivering mental health services throughout the country, but problems in the mental health system are far and wide.  Mental health staffing is still 25% lower than recommended in the mental health policy A Vision for Change.  Specialist 24-seven mental health crisis services are not evenly available throughout the country and, as a result, people may be obliged to wait for hours in accident and emergency departments.  In 2015, approximately one third of child and adolescent admissions to hospital were to adult units.  There is no national advocacy service dedicated to families of people with mental health difficulties or dedicated to those with such difficulties who live in the community.<\/p> <p>We must not ignore the contributing factor that alcohol has on our mental health and how it exacerbates pre-existing mental health difficulties.  Alcohol affects our ability to cope with everyday life and can have significant consequences when we face traumatic life events.  Alcohol has a key impact on the number of suicides, being a contributory factor in more than 50% of cases.  A total of 11,000 cases involving self-harm present to accident and emergency departments each year, and one third of all cases relate to alcohol.  The World Health Organization has estimated that the risk of suicide where a person is abusing alcohol is eight times greater than if he or she were not doing so.  Suicide is the leading cause of death among young Irishmen aged between 15 and 24.<\/p> <p>In tackling mental health, it is imperative that we look at matters in a holistic way.  In particular, we should look at gender analysis.  The HSE and the National Women's Council, along with others, have been successful in securing the visit to Ireland in 2017 of the World Congress on Women's Mental Health.  The HSE has had a successful project in policy-proofing gender analysis and we should work hard to ensure this is implemented in all mental health areas.<\/p> <p>We must also not forget about the families impacted upon by addiction.  This issue is extremely close to my heart.  We need to ensure the appropriate support services are available to these families, that their risk of mental health issues is reduced by early intervention and that funding is found for organisations supporting them.  On a daily basis, I deal with family members who are absolutely heartbroken because somebody they love has an alcohol, drug or gambling problem.<\/p> <p>The task before us is huge.  It is a difficult task but certainly one we should not shy away from or write a report about.  We need direct action.  We need to hold Ministers, officials and service providers to account and ensure that we achieve the highest quality of services for the thousands of people throughout the country affected by mental health issues.<\/p> <p>Mental Health Reform has been campaigning on the implementation of the recommendations and I support it in calling on the Government and the Minister to implement these recommendations and put our nation's mental health as a top priority.  Acting now will save further heartache, anguish and distress to our fellow citizens.  A country is judged by how it treats its vulnerable.

She is passionate about this area of work.  Her passion and commitment will make a big difference in the Department.  Everyone in this House has admired the work done by her predecessor, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Even though Deputy McEntee has big shoes to fill she will make her own mark on the Department.  She will work very hard to deliver better services and change in the essential area of mental health.<\/p> <p>There is a huge degree of unanimity in the House on what needs to be done to promote positive mental health and the type of services that we need.  Just like yesterday's debate on health services in general, there will be  no shortage of ideas about the areas that need to be resourced and where resources should be directed.  First, we need to be very clear about stopping the almost routine discussion or threat of pilfering the mental health service budget in terms of the overall and politically sensitive general health budget.  It is not an overstatement to say that, traditionally, the mental health service has been one of the Cinderella services in terms of the overall funding envelope for health.  My colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, fought a Trojan battle to ensure that resources were ring-fenced for mental health services during the very difficult times for this State over the past few years.  If we are serious about mental health funding then we need to adequately and properly fund positive promotional campaigns.  We must also fund good services - and that is the point - that are proven to work and are responsive to people's needs.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I met part of the leadership team of the Union of Students in Ireland, Mr. Kevin Donoghue and Ms Aoife N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, to discuss their mental health priorities.  It is an organisation that works on the front-line with young people in vulnerable situations.  I pay tribute to its I Am A Reason campaign, which promotes positive mental and identifies the need for improved services across the country.  That campaign, as other campaigns have pointed to, directs much of its attention towards the absence of 24-7 crisis intervention services across the country.  As we all know, trauma and personal crises do not occur on a 9 to 5 basis, Monday to Friday.  The official policy suggests that a network of 16 crisis houses should be provided all around the country.  They would deal and provide accommodation and support to people in crisis situations, on a temporary basis, and until such time as connections could be made with the community and mental health teams to develop proper care programmes to deal with some of the issues experienced by people.  Also, to address the underlying issues that precipitated the crisis in the first place.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State supports this objective and I look forward to hearing her views on how the policy objective can be rolled out.  <\/p> <p>I shall conclude by responding to comments made by Senator Craughwell about bullying in the workplace.  It is an insidious phenomenon.  Many mental health crises that people experience can be put down to some experiences in the workplace that may have been inadequately dealt with.  The Senator is right when he said that there is only civil redress available, which is a costly and slow process.  Workplace bullying is a scourge and is very insidious.  One of the reasons that is the case is that no clear procedures have been set down.  In 2006, the task force on bullying report commented on the lack of clear and formal procedures needed to deal with bullying complaints.  It also mentioned the need to outline a formal route for adjudication on bullying complaints because all too often workplace bullying complaints are not addressed quickly and efficiently and so end up in the courts, which is damaging for both the employees, who may be victims, and employers who may, in many circumstances, be doing their utmost to address an insidious situation.  I wish to correct Senator Craughwell by stating that this is not a matter for the Minister of State or any colleagues in the Department of Health to address the workplace bullying, even though I am sure that the Minister of State has a view on the matter.  It is a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I ask her to accept the will of the D&aacute;il as expressed in the support shown for the Labour Party's motion that was tabled three weeks ago, which included a provision to counteract such bullying by putting statutory redress in place, thus providing a formal route of adjudication to ensure that the scourge of workplace bullying, that can lead to a huge amount of mental distress, be addressed efficiently and effectively.  That is not the case at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#U00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I call Senator Murnane O'Connor and she has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#U00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Can I give my colleague two minutes of my time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#U00600","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#U00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment.

Beyond the striking statistics on suicide levels and the affliction of depression extracting a hefty toll on the day-to-day lives of countless people, the recovery model recognises that treatment is not merely about the listing of symptoms but also ensuring that the person can live a productive and meaningful life despite the vulnerabilities that continue to exist.  <\/p> <p>I want to ask the Minister of State about funding.  As she will know, her Department has an annual allocation of &euro;35 million for the mental health budget.  I ask her to increase the allocation to &euro;37.5 million because the Department of Health has said it needs that amount to provide all of the necessary services.  Increased funding is critically important.  I firmly believe that funding is the key to everything.  We need to ensure that we give a proper service to people in need, in particular people who need mental health services.    <\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to establish a national mental health authority.  Such an authority would show a sense of urgency in terms of tackling mental health issues and reducing self-harm and suicide.  In this regard we must ring-fence funding for mental health services.  Far too often, as the Minister of State will be aware, funding is pulled from the mental health budget and allocated to other areas.  I ask her to ensure that none of the mental health budget is touched and that it is increased.  <\/p> <p>The principle of early intervention is critical.  Addressing mental health problems that arise in early childhood and adolescent years leads to better educational outcomes, the prevention of several mental health issues and, in later life, it can lead to a better quality of life.  This is why it is important that extra funding is allocated.   <\/p> <p>The provision of counselling is essential.  Teachers should receive mental health training in order to equip them to identify whether children need support and, in particular, if they feel a child has mental health issues that they can mention their concern to someone.

A report has found that mental health services for children and teenagers are understaffed and overstretched while access to getting support is confusing.  Given the confusion in this area I ask the Minister of State to look at the issue.  Some 61 approved centres were inspected in 2015 and of these only six were rated compliant.  The remaining number were non-compliant to varying degrees.  It is critical for the Minister of State to establish a youth mental health task force within 100 days.  I make this request as a person who lives in Carlow and who has been a councillor for 19 years.  I have witnessed many changes.  Recently Carlow has had several young suicides.  Like many other counties, Carlow wants to be a part of the task force that is being established for youth and mental health.<\/p><p>In her contribution the Minister of State mentioned that within the next 100 days she will initiate an evidence-based expert review of progress in the implementation of this policy and in the improvement of mental health services.  It is crucial that areas such as my area in Carlow and neighbouring counties play a role in the task force.  Every local authority and every area of mental health can play a role and have its say.  It is crucial that we all know what is happening.  Information on this issue will be crucial.

Working in the homeless sector I have become increasingly worried, especially in the past decade, that having made the transition from institution and asylum type treatment, a large proportion of people who were being cared for within that structure ended up on our streets due to a big gap in services.  They were not being treated in the community but began to be treated by project workers, who are not mental health professionals, within a hostel setting.  To provide a little background, on any given occasion I could walk in on a shift and 12 or more people would have to be put on hourly checks because of their mental health.<\/p> <p>As one opens the door one does not know what one will find.  I have cut people down from nooses.  I have had to use my stockings at one stage to stem the bleeding of a man who had slit his throat.  These are people who definitely should not be cared for within a hostel setting that does not have adequate services to treat them.  At any given time, ambulance personnel would arrive and the resident may refuse to go.  As a project worker one would invest hours trying to convince the person who was suicidal to go to the emergency department where two things could happen.  Because of the dual diagnosis, the addiction takes over and the person goes into a state of withdrawal and leaves without being given adequate treatment or else the person is seen but is told the wounds will be looked at but will not be treated.  Given that dual diagnosis is normal within that sector, care plans should be in place to deal with a person's mental health and addiction rather than sending such a person from one door to another.  On many occasions people have left the emergency department.  Last year, a man went out and straight under a car after he could not handle waiting in the emergency department due to suicide ideation.<\/p> <p>The report, Homelessness: An Unhealthy State, by Dr. Fiona O'Reilly and Dr. Austin O'Carroll, of which I was a part, which looked at the health status, risk behaviours and service utilisation by homeless people in Dublin and Limerick, points out that almost half, 47%, of the sample experienced mental health issues and addiction problems.  This co-occurrence of mental health and addiction has been termed dual diagnosis.  People who have both substance misuse and mental health problems have particular difficulties exiting homelessness and taking care of their physical and mental health.  The research shows that more than half the sample had previously experienced suicidal thoughts and more than a third had attempted suicide.  One in three homeless people have been so desperate as to attempt suicide.  Shockingly, the statistic gets even worse for people with mental health problems with half of those with a diagnosis reporting having attempted suicide in the past.  The depressing statistics, which reflect my experiences, find mental ill health the norm among the homeless population, with 58% having at least one mental health diagnosis.  Some 13% were diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychosis compared with 1% in the general population.<\/p> <p>The inverse care law states that those in most need of care are least likely to get it.  That a cohort of our population exists on the margins of society where mental health problems are the norm demonstrates the existence of this inequitable inverse care law.  Will the Minister of State commit to turning the inverse law on its head and bring equality and fairness to light by ensuring that those in most need of mental health care get it?  Will the Minister of State commit to the following as a matter of urgency: that a coherent and specific stepwise approach to presentations by homeless people in crisis in line with national suicide prevention guidelines be established and rolled out within the homeless sector; and that a crisis house for homeless people as recommended in A Vision for Change needs to be established.<\/p> <p>This can take effect immediately by ring fencing a number of existing beds 24-7 within the homeless sector with nursing staff linked to inpatient psychiatric care for homeless people at risk who would not be best served within an emergency department.  Professional care needs to be equipped with specific skillsets to meet clients' needs, that is, mental health social workers are needed on site in homeless accommodation in numbers with the very high mental health need evidenced in this study.  These professionals can identify need among the homeless individuals and navigate the many excellent mainstream services, removing barriers for homeless people, allowing them access the appropriate care.  Mental health training guidance for workers in the homeless sector and appropriate supports for clients is needed.  Clear recognition for dual diagnosis as a reconfiguration of services to treat this as the norm in homelessness rather than the exception is needed.  Addiction and mental health services have evolved separately and without reorientation towards the service user the homeless person continues to get shifted back and forth between the two services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#V00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.

We are all on the same page in that regard.  It is important that we work together, listen to each other and work with the services to improve what is already in place.  It is reasonable to say, however, there have been real and significant developments in the service initiated by the previous Government.  I acknowledge the work taken on by my predecessor, Kathleen Lynch, and all of those in the Department.<\/p><p>Up to &euro;115 million in additional funding has already been allocated to mental health services under the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan.  That funding is there to enhance all aspects of the service.  New investment and new personnel have been directed towards developing specialised services which, up until now, did not receive the attention they deserve and need.  I will stand over the commitment to increase mental health funding every year.  Obviously, the restoration of the &euro;35 million development fund was important to me and I am glad it is back.  While I am Minister of State, I would like to say it would never happen again.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work carried out by the HSE and the voluntary and statutory organisations because they are working with those who are often at the lowest point in their lives.  It is a difficult environment and, with increased demands and resource limitations, we need to ensure they get all the credit they deserve.<\/p><p>There is a real and genuine will across all political parties to modernise our services and bring us in line with best practice.  Fundamental to that is our attitude to mental health.  While we have come a long way in a short time, there is still a long way to go.  To reduce the stigma and isolation associated with this area, we need to start thinking of it in the same way we do physical illness.  If a person breaks a bone or cuts himself or herself, he or she goes to an accident and emergency department or his or her doctor.  If people feel under pressure or do not feel supported, we need to get to the point where they feel it is okay for them to seek help and the stigma is thereby reduced.  In that regard, we need a concerted effort in respect of men in their 40s in the same way we targeted women through BreastCheck to deal with a specific problem and stop it at an early stage.  We need such a programme to target men who are at risk, particularly those in the workplace.  I hope to progress this in line with our connecting for life strategy and by placing a greater emphasis on health and wellness, early intervention and prevention.  Education is key in this regard.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is rolling out the wellness programme through his Department.  Through my own task force, I would like to see it brought back to an even earlier stage.<\/p><p>The review of A Vision for Change is necessary but I agree that progress cannot be halted at the same time.  The vision will not change, even with a review.  The review needs to operate in tandem with continued investment and implementation.  If changes are to be recommended at the end of the review, they should be incorporated into the policy.<\/p><p>As I have said previously, it is not just the Department of Health which needs to be dealing with this issue.  It also touches on homelessness, the Traveller community, work environments and the judicial system, meaning I will need much support from my ministerial colleagues.  I intend to ask them to identify key areas in which they need support from me.<\/p><p>I will come back to Senators on St. Loman's and other specific issues.  If there are other specific questions I have not touched on, Senators can contact me about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#V00500","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466587800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU-UK Relations: Statements","time":1466587800,"counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#Z00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#Z00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to address the recently convened Seanad.

As Senators will be aware, this has been a closely fought campaign in the United Kingdom and the tragic events of last Thursday understandably cast a dark cloud over proceedings in these final days.  We all felt absolute horror at the murder of Jo Cox, MP, above all for her young family.  As parliamentarians with deep links to our communities and constituencies, we find this brutal killing as Jo went about her work at her clinic particularly chilling.  Jo and her family remain in our thoughts.<\/p> <p>The Government's position on the referendum should be well known to everybody.  We want the UK, as our friend, closest neighbour and partner, to remain a member of the European Union.  This is a view which enjoys almost unanimous support within both Houses of the Oireachtas, although I recognise and respect that there is a differing point of view.  The reasons underpinning the Government position will also be familiar to Senators.  These include important considerations relating to our economy; Northern Ireland; the common travel area and; of course the European Union itself.<\/p> <p>The Government and our diplomatic teams in Britain, Northern Ireland, Brussels and across the European Union have been very active on this issue since the moment the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, signalled his support for a referendum in 2013.  The momentum of this work has never eased at any stage over these past three years.<\/p> <p>Our first core objective was to help get agreement on a settlement package for the UK which would be acceptable to all European partners, and which would enable the British Prime Minister to recommend and campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union.  The Taoiseach was heavily involved in working to secure such an outcome at the February European Council.<\/p> <p>With that agreement reached, the focus turned to the referendum itself.  In tandem with the EU negotiations, since 2013 we have also been systematically setting out the Irish case for the UK remaining in the European Union.  The Taoiseach, I and other Ministers have set out Ireland's position in keynote addresses across Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as with our UK counterparts during regular bilateral meetings.<\/p> <p>I spoke most recently with UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Philip Hammond, on Monday at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg.  He knows from our frequent conversations that Ireland is firmly of the view - one shared by our partners - that negotiation and decision-making at EU level benefit from having a strong British voice at the table.<\/p> <p>At all stages I, other Government colleagues, our diplomats and officials have ensured regular contact with the Irish communities across Britain and it is to these communities that we appeal for participation in this vital decision for all of us.  During the course of a visit to the UK in early April, I identified a desire to hear the Irish perspective among the Irish community, on behalf of Government and Opposition.  My experience of referendums here meant that I was aware of the sensitivities, but at all stages was happy to give our perspective, when asked.<\/p> <p>Over the past three months or so as the formal campaign was under way, Senators will have noticed that the Irish Government, complemented by active engagement by civil society here in Ireland, the Irish community in Britain and leading Opposition figures, has made its own contribution to the referendum debate.  We fully respect that the decision ultimately lies with the UK electorate, but we strove to put across the Irish perspective, including through a programme of 14 visits at Government level to Britain and Northern Ireland since the beginning of April.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I managed this programme across Government and as part of it I visited London, Belfast, Derry, Liverpool and Manchester.<\/p> <p>As I stressed during my visits to Belfast, Derry and elsewhere, the fact that Ireland is the only EU member state that shares a land border with the UK was a particularly compelling reason for the Government to feel obliged to ensure our perspective was known and clearly understood.  As a Minister who has spent a considerable period of my time focused on the need to support and sustain political stability in Northern Ireland, I am acutely conscious of the negative implications of a \"Leave\" decision on the progress that has been made over the past 20 years.<\/p> <p>Polling day is tomorrow and the UK electorate will, of course, have the final say on this important issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Polls suggest both outcomes are equally possible.

People in Britain will make a crucial decision tomorrow.  While the decision is for Britain to decide, Ireland is in a unique position heading into this week's vote as it is the only country in the European Union that shares a land border with the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>Britain is our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner.  Reports have warned of the repercussions for Ireland across several sectors including the trade, travel, tourism, energy and agrifood sectors.  Although a Brexit will affect us all, our Border counties will be most exposed to the effects of that vote if Britain decides to leave.  The 310-mile frontier that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic is the only land border between the UK and the rest of the EU.  Although heavily militarised with checkpoints and road closures during the Troubles, peace has opened up a seamless crossing between both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Young people today do not recall the Border checkpoints and customs hold-ups that we had to endure in the past.  If one crosses the Border now there is little to alert one of such; it is seamless.  One might notice a red post box, a subtle change in the road surface, miles instead of kilometres on road signs or the disappearance of bilingual signs, but that is all.<\/p><p>Thousands of people pass over the Border every day on their way to work, for shopping or on day trips.  If one visits a school along the Border one will find children with parents, grandparents or other family members from across the Border, but it is not just families.  Farms, businesses and property straddle the Border as well.  Thousands of people from our Border counties work across the Border and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  People in Border counties like Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are waiting anxiously to see the outcome of the Brexit referendum.<\/p><p>The &quot;Remain&quot; camp in the referendum, including Chancellor George Osborne, have warned that a hardening of border controls would be inevitable in the event of the UK voting to leave the EU.  Given that migration has been an important factor driving the &quot;Leave&quot; campaign, the British Government could come under pressure to impose Border checks to prevent Ireland becoming an access point for undocumented migrants.<\/p><p>The British Chancellor has warned that a vote to leave the European Union would cause an economic shock in the North, forcing the return of Border checkpoints, slashing farmers' incomes and costing the region &pound;1.3 billion.  Some time ago he stated, &quot;Let's be clear, if we quit the EU then this is going to be the border with the European Union ... ie new immigration checkpoints, border controls and an end to free movement - that has a real consequence, and there would have to be a real hardening of the border imposed either by the British government or indeed by the Irish government.&quot;<\/p><p>For the first time in a generation, Border controls and customs checkpoints between Northern Ireland and the Republic have become a distinct possibility.  We remember the hassle, the nuisance and the cost, the queues of trucks and the overnight waiting.  We are not looking forward to a return to that.<\/p><p>A Brexit would be an obstacle to the cross-Border economic co-operation that is profoundly benefiting both states on this island.  It would also damage trade and investment North and South.<\/p><p>The reality is that those campaigning for a Brexit are asking people in Northern Ireland to swap the benefits of membership of a Single Market with 500 million people for an uncertain future, where free trade will be curtailed and where new tariffs will undermine the competitiveness of Northern Irish exports.<\/p><p>Locals in the Border area fear that such factors and the reinstatement of checkpoints would be a deterrent to trade and travel.  We know from experience that there will be knock-on effects.<\/p><p>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, who is campaigning on the &quot;Leave&quot; side, claims that, in the event of a Brexit, the Border would remain as &quot;free-flowing&quot; as it is today.  Ireland and Britain had a common travel area before either were in the EU, and that arrangement has prevailed over the years, but Ms Villiers has been contradicted by the Governments in Dublin and London which have left open the possibility of new controls being introduced.<\/p><p>It is difficult to imagine a situation where there would be no controls or checks on the movement of goods if the UK left the EU.  This would inevitably involve additional costs.  There might conceivably also be British as well as EU measures.<\/p><p>In Amsterdam in January, the Taoiseach said that if Britain were to leave the European Union we would be looking at Border controls in Ireland, despite the fact that we have a common travel area.  That view has been echoed in London, where a report by the British Government Cabinet Office in March warned that if the UK left the EU customs union &quot;it would be necessary to impose customs checks on the movement of goods across the border&quot;.  It further stated, &quot;Questions would also need to be answered about the common travel area which covers the movement of people.&quot;<\/p><p>In the Border counties and the frontier towns such as Monaghan town, Cavan, Dundalk, Sligo or Letterkenny, the economy is very fragile, and we need freedom of movement for tourism and visitors in particular.  Reports suggest unemployment could rise by as much as 14,000 in Northern Ireland over two years if the UK left the European Union, with 2,000 added to the youth unemployment figure.  It must be remembered that many of those employees are from this side of the Border.  Fewer jobs in Northern Ireland, and possible knock-on effects on business and employment on this side of the Border, would see family incomes hit and the value of people's homes and pensions falling.<\/p><p>The UK has had a greater influence on the EU's development than it realises and if it chooses to stay, Britain can and will continue to have a major influence.  I hope that when the people in the UK and our friends in Northern Ireland go to vote they make the right decision and vote to remain as part of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#AA00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>People in Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to decide whether they should remain in or leave the European Union.  It is the second time a referendum on the issue has been held in the UK.  In 1975, a large majority - 67% - voted to remain in what was then the EEC.<\/p> <p>Throughout the current campaign many issues have been debated vigorously including immigration, security and the economic consequences of remaining or leaving the EU.  Some months ago I had the good fortune of being invited to speak in London to the Irish4Europe organisation.  I said that we have a history of referendums in this country - the people in the UK are not that familiar with them - and that often people do not answer the question put to them.  They might dislike the Government or have a problem with various issues but sometimes the compelling question is not addressed in referendums.  That is democracy, but the important message in terms of immigration, security and economic consequences is sometimes missed in the debate.  This day week I was going into Belfast when I heard a powerful but, I believe, factually incorrect advertisement on a local radio station; it may have been Downtown Radio.  It referred to hundreds of millions of pounds being given every week and that 300,000 immigrants, equivalent to the population of Cardiff, were coming to Britain every year.  That hit a nerve, and it can be said by those on both sides of the debate.  I congratulate the members of Irish4Europe for the work they have done.<\/p> <p>My father worked for most of his life in London, and I know many people who worked in Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, but in the past 50, 60 or 70 years we did not mobilise in the way we should have done.  I put that down to not having the confidence or not being as mobilised as other nationalities.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for all the work they have done, but also all the parties North and South for their involvement in trying to ensure that the Irish in Britain vote to remain in the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a decision for the British electorate.  We have to look at it from the outside.  However, we must have a say and I believe we do.  If one thing happens as a result of this referendum, I hope it is that Irish people who are in favour of the European movement will once more mobilise in a united way to pursue and support all aspects of Irishness in the United Kingdom.  I hope our voice will be heard a little more.  It is wonderful to see all the various people working behind the scenes.  I remember that people of all hues and from all parts of society were at the meeting I mentioned.  Their voices were being and must continue to be heard.  We have come a long way and can now stand up as a nation and as part of a republic and more or less state we have a voice.<\/p><p>The economic arguments in favour of the United Kingdom staying in the European Union are compelling.  Some 45% of the United Kingdom's trade is with the European Union, courtesy of its access to the Single European Market which is free of tariffs and border controls.  It is estimated that approximately 3 million jobs in the United Kingdom are tied to the European Union.  Economic data demonstrate that Ireland's relationship with Britain has been and continues to be incredibly valuable.  The United Kingdom is Ireland's second largest trade market after the United States.  The United Kingdom exports more to Ireland than it does to China, India and Brazil combined.  I will set out some of the data in more detail.  Goods and services worth more than &euro;1.2 billion are traded between our two islands every week.  Some 200,000 people are employed in Ireland as a direct result of the export of Irish goods to the United Kingdom.  This accounts for 10% of all employment in Ireland.  In 2015, 3.5 million UK tourists visited Ireland, while 2.6 million Irish tourists visited the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>When I have to travel to England or elsewhere in Britain, I can take a flight or travel without a passport.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus flights are very good value, but it can cost over &euro;200 if one has to book a flight on the day.  One can get on a boat at 8 a.m. and be in London for 6 p.m., having completed one's journey by train, for just &euro;53.  One does not need a passport, although one sometimes needs identification.  These are things we take for granted.  I travelled to Cardiff for the opening of the Welsh Assembly two weeks ago.  It was a lovely journey and nobody looked for a passport.  I ended up in Cardiff at 9 p.m. that night.  I fear what will happen in the event of a Brexit.<\/p><p>The previous speaker rightly referred to the possible reintroduction of Border controls.  Thirty years ago people were smuggling little items like butter across the Border where I remember queueing up in previous times.  I live 40 miles from it.  I used to represent the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim right beside the Border.  We take for granted the great work done on the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement, into which all of the major parties have put great work.  In the past three years the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association has met in Stormont and this august Chamber.  It has gone unnoticed that members of all the political parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic have attended meetings of the association.  I really think we should rejoice because we have come a long way.  I am worried that people will vote in favour of Brexit, but I hope that on Friday the people of the United Kingdom will vote to remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#AA00400","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I was touched by his references to the late Jo Cox.  Last night I watched an interview with her husband and was immensely impressed by his dignity, self-control and concern for the real issues that lay at the heart of this terrible and tragic political murder, if one can call a murder by a madman a political act.<\/p> <p>I am a reluctant supporter of Britain staying in the European Union, in which I have always believed.  The European Union in which I believe is a union of people, a social Europe, rather than a Europe of financial institutions.  In recent times we have seen the naked exercise of power by unelected and unaccountable European financial institutions, to the great detriment of the peoples of Europe who are fed up to their back teeth.  There is not a country in Europe where there is no revulsion against the European Union and its dictatorial attitudes.<\/p> <p>The holding of this referendum was a particularly stupid idea on the part of Mr. Cameron.  I bet he is now regretting that decision because the margin is too tight to call.  Nobody actually knows how it will go and the reason they do not know is that they are not discussing the issues at all.  They are discussing everything else.  Not a single major company is in favour of Britain leaving.  I have not heard of a single reputable economist who is in favour of it leaving.  Not a single country is in favour it leaving.<\/p> <p>The Brexiteers are saying they do not want to be bothered with all the experts.  If they are not going to listen to the experts, to whom are they going to listen?  Are they going to listen to Boris Johnson?  We all know damn well that he only threw his hat in the ring and changed his position because he had his eye on the leadership of the Tory party.  He is also a liar.  We saw him approximately six months ago talking about Turkey which he was encouraging to join the European Union.  He was saying this would be wonderful, but now it is the biggest scare tactic there is.  It is being suggested all of the Turks will jump into Britain and overwhelm it.<\/p> <p>This immigration business is utterly obscene, disgusting and repulsive.  It does not do credit to a great country like Britain.  It is a very complex issue.  When I was watching television the other evening, it was staggering to hear two people raise the issue of immigration in the most negative way.  One was an Afghan immigrant to Britain, while the other was a Moroccan.  It is the usual human thing that the minute one gets in, one pulls up the ladder to stop anybody else from getting in.  Morally, it is very repulsive.<\/p> <p>People are disillusioned with the European Union.  We can consider what it has done to this country as an example.  I do not want anybody to tell me that Ireland is a net beneficiary.  The European Union is a beneficiary, or perhaps a bene-fishery because it has received &euro;200 billion of our fish stocks for nothing.  An awful lot would have to be paid into the Irish Exchequer to get that back.  We also need to look at what the European institutions did to this country.  They humiliated the people.  They forced a transfer of bank debts onto the shoulders of ordinary Irish people.  They did the same in Cyprus and Greece.  That is how much they care about the ordinary people of this country.  Despite our alleged economic growth, we are still slave labour for the German and French banks, to which this country was indentured in a most disgusting way.  People are disillusioned.  I agree with the Brexiteers who believe there is a lack of democracy in the European Union.  How many people could name those who are actually running it?  They are unelected, paid enormous amounts of money and not accountable.  There is a fundamental lack of democracy.  I hope Britain will stay in, even though the result will be on a knife-edge.  I hope that with the assistance of this country, Britain will help to push through real and radical reform of the European system.  The whole European project was very badly thought out.  The euro is a mess.  It was not properly regarded or analysed before it was instituted.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on what is one of the most crucial referendums in the United Kingdomor the Republic that we will see in our lifetime.  Tomorrow millions of British citizens, from Belfast to Bristol and from Dover to Dundee, will have the opportunity to vote on Britain's membership of the European Union.  We can all agree that it is in our nation's best interests that these millions of voters vote to remain as part of the European Union.<\/p><p>As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I have been following the referendum debate for some time.  A. A. Gill, writing in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>at the weekend, wrote: &quot;The dream of Brexit isn't that we might be able to make a brighter, new, energetic tomorrow, it's a desire to shuffle back to a regret-curdled inward-looking yesterday.&quot;  He was quite right.  If one listens to any of the language being used by those advocating a &quot;Leave&quot; vote, it is always about wanting to make Britain great again, taking back power from Brussels and the other assertions we have been hearing for weeks.  The majority of those who want to leave - they are a mixture of voters, although some claim they are older - are looking back to the bygone days of their youth which they remember with a certain sentimental value.  They believe they can recreate them by voting to leave the European Union, but never has a group of people been so misguided.  The European Union and its predecessor, the European Economic Community, wanted to promote interdependence, peace and economic prosperity among the nations of Europe and make another continental war unthinkable.  They have succeeded in that regard.  If Britain was to turn its back on the European project, it would be turning its back on the most successful political project the world has seen.  It would be turning its back on a shared European history, of which we are all part.  In doing so it would find itself isolated and alone, much like the United States was during the 1930s.<\/p><p>From an Irish perspective, Britain leaving the European Union would have serious consequences north and south of the Border.  As our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom is naturally one of our most important trading partners for goods and services, as has been the case since the foundation of the Irish Free State.  For example, we export goods worth &euro;14 billion and services worth &euro;20 billion to the United Kingdom.  The ESRI has asserted that, if was a Brexit was to occur, it would reduce trade flows between Ireland and the United Kingdom by 20% on average, with the impact differing significantly across sectors and products.  Can we credibly say nothing would change along the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland?  Of course, we cannot.  It is unrealistic of people to suggest matters would remain the same.  We would have an EU border stretching from Dundalk to Derry, similar to the Greek-Turkish border.<\/p><p>The Republic of Ireland holds its breath as we await the outcome of the referendum.  For our sake, I hope the British people will make the mature, smart and right decision to remain part of the European Union.  Consider the effect on tourism.  The British are our best customers.  The numbers we receive each year have been mentioned.  Thanks be to God, sterling is strong.  Last year we had our best season and this year it has been even better.  One cannot find a hotel bedroom in Dublin except at an awful price, but that is a separate issue.  Recently, the stock market became jittery and volatile because the &quot;Leave&quot; side was dominant in the polls.  Thanks be to God, they are back in sync; the markets have recovered somewhat and sterling has strengthened again.  The British are our most valuable customers and we need to hold onto them.  They are playing with fire, but we will have to wait until tomorrow to know the outcome.  I hope the right decision will be made from their point of view, as well as ours.<\/p><p>I support everything the Minister, his colleagues and everyone in the other parties have been trying to do in campaigning to ensure Irish voters, the number of whom is large in Britain's cities and the countryside, come out tomorrow to vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#CC00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht a bheith anseo linn chun an t-&aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute;igh.

I thank the Minister for appearing before us to discuss this important issue.  It is an eleventh hour debate in terms of what we can contribute, but the issue has been raised in the Chamber in the past two weeks and we are unified in our concern about what a Brexit might do to the national interest.  Other Senators have eloquently and comprehensively laid out the potential economic dangers and the impact of a Brexit on the State and the entire island, North and South, all of which would be negative.<\/p> <p>I was going to make a lengthy speech, but I will not now, as I am in the unique position of having a vote on Thursday and I intend to use it to vote in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.  This is not a quick-witted, gut or knee-jerk reaction but a considered and tough decision, as I am sure has been the case for many across the North.<\/p> <p>The Minister and many other colleagues will appreciate that I do not want to be a victim of Little England.  I do not want to be a victim of David Cameron's attempts to see off Nigel, Boris and the rest of those on the far right.  What a political masterstroke holding the referendum has turned out to be for him.  It is a sad reflection that our fortunes, North and South, could be damaged and impeded by that ill-considered move.  At its heart, the referendum is about immigration.  It is not about Britain's membership of the European Union or the benefits it brings to Britain and this island.  It is simply a gut reaction to the pressure exerted by immigration.  What a sad reflection on the political leadership of that country.<\/p> <p>I do not need to remind the Minister that he has a duty of care to Irish citizens across the island, North and South.  In the event of a Brexit, it is imperative that the State ensure there will be no subversion of the institutions which were hard fought for and hard won under the Good Friday Agreement.  This issue must take precedence.  The State must ensure the political protection of citizens, North and South.  It must build on the eloquent points made by Senators about solidifying the peace process and building reconciliation across the island.  The European Union has played a key role in that regard through, for example, human rights legislation.  The Minister knows, however, that the British Government is trying to claw back on the Human Rights Act and that there is no such Act in the North.  If we were to lose membership of the European Union, it would have a detrimental impact.  Human rights, employment rights, maternity leave and trade union rights are affected day to day by membership of the Union.<\/p> <p>A notable issue for me and many others in an ever growing community in the North is that of the failure of the British Government to introduce, as agreed at St. Andrews, an Acht na Gaeilge.  The only legislative protection for the language is provided by European legislation, namely, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.  Losing it would hit the many thousands of p&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ag dul tr&iacute;d an earn&aacute;il gaelscola&iacute;ochta.  It is fair to say we have no friends in the British Government when it comes to upholding their rights.<\/p> <p>Other Senators have referred to the PEACE funds.  Previously, I was employed in a position in north Belfast that was funded under the PEACE III programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was legacy co-ordinator with Bridge of Hope, an organisation based in north Belfast that works to bring together grassroots community leaders, former combatants and political prisoners, and victims and survivors of the conflict in peace building initiatives.  This type of work is invaluable and, as the Minister appreciates and understands, vital for peace building, community relations and sustaining and embedding the peace process, particularly as we head into the summer months when we face the challenges and difficulties that occur every year.<\/p><p>We have the infrastructural benefits of being part of Europe.  The recently opened &pound;30 million extension to the Belfast Waterfront Hall was part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.  This facility will be critical in attracting tourists to Belfast and the North in general.  We appreciate what tourists bring to the economy.  The Border must not be hardened, nor can we return to Border checks and all the problems and nastiness to which previous speakers referred.<\/p><p>The British Government will not reimburse the North for the loss of any European funds because it is, in the first instance, a government of Tories driven by an ideological position that supports austerity and, second, because it has already cut &euro;4 billion from the North's block grant.  That is the agenda it is driving and it will mean farmers, ordinary citizens, workers and Irish language speakers losing out, as will, ultimately, the peace process.  We must ensure the interests of Ireland, North and South, are placed front and centre.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the only certainty in the referendum has been uncertainty.  I also appreciate the restrictions that apply to the Minister and his position.  Nevertheless, a carefully thought-out process will be required in the event of Brexit.  While I hope Britain will not leave the European Union, the Government must have in place a process for such an eventuality, one which ensures the Good Friday Agreement is not subverted, the peace and political processes are sustained and the rights, not least freedom of movement, of Irish citizens are protected and upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#CC00300","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for joining us today and facilitating this important debate.  Many Senators spoke eloquently about the impact and economic costs of a British exit from the European Union.  There is an irrefutable economic case for supporting a Remain vote in the referendum.  Substantial costs would have to be borne if the British people were to choose Brexit, especially in Northern Ireland, as has been eloquently and clearly set out.  What I will focus on initially are some of the other costs, namely, the human and social costs, that could flow from the referendum.<\/p> <p>In the past five years alone, 90,000 Irish people have travelled to live and work in the United Kingdom.  Many of them were driven by a period of austerity and recession.  Building on generations of complex interrelationships between the Irish at home and Irish people in Britain, we now have families with members from England and other European Union member states.  People now have a network of complex family relationships, in many cases involving partnerships with citizens from the European Union, including the United Kingdom.  Families regularly cross borders, whether the Border with Northern Ireland or with the United Kingdom when they fly or take a ferry to the UK.  I share Senator Feighan's interest in the ferry service as I like to travel by sea.  There are constant communications with the United Kingdom and many people have working careers that span Britain and Ireland.  All these people living complicated lives will face undue further complication if Brexit takes place.  Those who must already navigate complex families bred across nations will face further obstacles.<\/p> <p>On a human and practical level, the European health insurance system will not apply in the United Kingdom and the many Irish people who have spent part or all of their working lives in Britain will face unanswered questions as to how pensions will be negotiated between Ireland and Britain.<\/p> <p>People who are married to European Union citizens will face serious obstacles, particularly in travelling and crossing borders.  There is no doubt the Border would also be hardened in the event of Brexit, and customs and associated obstacles would be strengthened.  Social, creative, cultural and human exchange, which has led to deeper connections and a deepening of the peace process in recent years, would be placed in jeopardy.<\/p> <p>In addition to these consequences for Ireland, I will speak briefly about Europe as a whole.  There is no one Europe.  Europe is neither a beneficent monolith nor an instrument of repression but a ground on which we are all active and engage.  There is no consensus in Europe because multiple opinions are battling out what type of Europe we should have.  I share the concerns many people have, for example, on trade, having campaigned against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  I am also concerned about the potential impact of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and the European Union.  Major concerns arise about the austerity policies that have been pushed through the semester process and the downgrading of the much more ambitious and important Europe 2020 commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth.<\/p> <p>There are visions of a social Europe but they are narrowing and there has been an erosion of democratic accountability.  These are real concerns but our allies in these concerns are each other.  It is only by working together across Europe that we can tackle these issues and ensure we have the type of Europe we want.  I assure those who are worried about the erosion of workers' rights in the UK that the European trade unions are their allies.  Those who wish to protect public services are part of many movements across Europe.  For my part, having served on the executive of the European Women's Lobby, I have seen the strong support Europe has given to women's rights in Ireland over the years.  We are now seeing a backlash against women's equality in many eastern European countries and a conservatism that is sometimes frightening.  Being part of Europe, whether in its women's lobby or other such movements, is a resource for civil society in these times.<\/p> <p>Many of those who wish to create obstacles to the free movement of people are not averse to the free movement of capital.  Again, it is Europe that has sought to impose constraints on the free market, while many of those strongly advocating Brexit are happy for their money to travel at will to offshore locations.<\/p> <p>The challenges we face are global.  One cannot run away from the collective action that is needed on issues such as climate change and the building of peace.  These are collective issues and no border or decision can make them any less collective.  I ask and encourage all those in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland to vote to remain in the European Union, to be part of the collective struggle and to reinforce the peace process while working for peace across Europe.  If we see a victory for xenophobia and the types of anti-immigration messages we have seen in the media, the message against peace will have ripple effects across the rest of Europe.  I strongly encourage a Remain vote.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to exceed my speaking time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#DD00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>If speakers confine their remarks to six minutes, everyone who wishes to speak may do so, although that does not appear likely at the moment.

Regardless of the result of this referendum, it is clear that the EU needs to change.  For me, growing up in 1980s Ireland, the European project represented something big but still tangible.  Our copybooks were adorned with maps of the then EEC countries so that we could learn off their capital cities and perhaps dream about visiting those countries with ease, on holidays with our families in France or Spain, or perhaps even working in some of the great cities of the world, such as Rome or Amsterdam.  It was impossible to drive down any new road in Ireland without seeing - and rightly so - huge signage plastered with the European flag, informing us that the new roads were being built with the assistance of Structural Funds.<\/p><p>For older generations, my parents and my grandparents, the European project represented something a lot simpler, namely, bringing peace to our continent for the longest continual period in history: no more ration books, no more air raids, no more fear of men and women being once more called up to \"do their duty\".<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the contemporary EU has drifted.  It has become the very definition of meddling bureaucracy and micro-intervention, an entity whose image is one obsessed with regulating and intervening in the areas and issues that are removed from so many people's daily lives.  Too often national Governments, including our own, are to blame for this.  Governments are too quick to blame Brussels for all the bad news and to jump on the bandwagon in respect of, and claim credit for, all the good news that comes from Europe.  To counter this, the EU, to quote John Major, needs to get back to basics.  We need to see more focus on the positive, obvious initiatives.  Following on from a period of austerity, the EU needs to be front and centre of a new, modern infrastructural programme.  Let us clearly show the ordinary people of Europe how the EU works for them.  A rare recent success in this regard was the new regulations on roaming charges.<\/p><p>We need to champion, not admonish, the four defining freedoms of the EU.  Let us not pick them apart for niche negatives or focus on isolated incidents often taken out of context.  The EU needs to improve existing initiatives and scale back the bureaucracy that stops good programmes such as Erasmus+ from flourishing, preventing many European citizens from reaping the benefits provided due to something daft like a 52-page application form.<\/p><p>Tomorrow's vote in the UK represents the greatest threat to stability in Europe - our Europe - since the Second World War.  Regardless of the result, the UK's relationship within or without the EU will be changed for ever.  It is in this context that Ireland has the greatest challenge to face and perhaps the most important role to play.  I would like to take a moment to thank the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, for their visits to the UK in recent weeks.  I would also like to give credit to Sinn F&eacute;in, which is rare for me, for its activities in the North and the campaign it has run.  The campaigns of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SLDP, the Alliance Party and the UUP will have a major impact, and I hope to see that reflected when the results come in.<\/p><p>That said, I will conclude by putting on the record of the House what I have been annoying many of my friends and family who are voting tomorrow with for the past few weeks, be it on Facebook, by text or e-mail or as part of European Movement Ireland's postcard campaign.  I will conclude with a sincere appeal, one last time, to the good people of the UK, especially the massive Irish bloc entitled to vote: please vote to remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#DD00400","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  History does not repeat itself as much as it rhymes.  In 1975, instead of the Conservative Party tearing itself apart, it was the Labour Party that had a referendum in the UK held against the backdrop of the exact same arguments that are being made today.  Ironically enough, the current leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, voted against remaining in the EEC at the time, and the same arguments that were being made in 1975 are being made today by the former Mayor of London and by Mr. Nigel Farage, that their wives could not get into hospitals and their kids could not get into schools.  Here we are hearing the same arguments being put forward.<\/p> <p>What we must understand is that when the UK joined the EEC in 1973 and started that process over a number of decades, it was doing so from a position of weakness rather than being positive about its engagement with the EEC, as it was at the time.  It was doing so against the backdrop of the loss of empire.  When the Second World War finished, the UK was in charge of nearly a quarter of the planet and 630 million people were under its control.  By 1961 only 300 million were under the control of the British Empire and its dominions, at which time it was engaging with the EEC not because it wanted to but because it saw the Commonwealth and its responsibility, power and influence being diminished and considered the EEC was a way of getting it through what was a very tough economic time.  The UK had also gone through its own form of a bailout, with the IMF coming in.<\/p> <p>What the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and others have said about Britain within the EU is that the latter does not diminish the UK's role but actually magnifies it and its ability to engage with what is now a larger bloc and to have its influence, which, as other Members have said, is very important in lessening the power of the bureaucrats.  In many ways, the European Union has lost its way because it is no longer, and many would say it never was, a democracy.  To some extent, the European parliaments, those Governments that assisted the EU and those that are part of it do not want it to be a democracy, but that means that the public, the general population, the citizens of Europe, do not have any trust in what are unofficial, unelected bureaucrats.  That was the argument put forward by those who were against remaining in the EEC when the previous referendum called by the British Labour Party was held in 1975 and it is being put forward by the Conservative Party again now.  The latter is saying that the European Union is heading towards a federalisation and more and continuous union and that this is not something the citizens of Europe favour, as we saw when the UK voted against the referendum to introduce a European constitution.  That proposal was abandoned by the bureaucrats because referendums kept being lost.  They were lost in France, Ireland and the Netherlands.  Of course, as good bureaucrats do, they found another way and brought in a treaty that was ratified at parliamentary level in every country except Ireland.  Of course, we were asked to vote on it again.  There is no longer any faith in Europe as an institution because it has been designed by bureaucrats to be run by bureaucrats.<\/p> <p>The most fundamental failing of its citizens by the EU occurred when the banking crisis hit Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Cyprus.  It was the citizens who suffered, and the people who benefited the most are the millionaires and billionaires.  There is no way that Europe can regain that trust unless it gives the power back to the people.  The Minister will be aware of the different reports compiled by the ESRI in November 2015.  The ESRI talked about the trade, foreign direct investment, energy and migration issues that will affect us if the UK votes to leave the EU.  If there is a Brexit, everything about this has the potential for negative outcomes.  Teagasc's report on the impact on the farming sector said that it will affect us negatively and result in a direct loss of between &euro;150 million and &euro;800 million.  IBEC has also looked at the issues that will affect us directly.<\/p> <p>There is now also the distinct possibility that another referendum on Scottish independence will take place in the next decade or so.  This is obviously a longer-term, decades-long issue based on what could happen in the referendum tomorrow, if the UK decides to leave the EU.  That is not to say that the Scottish National Party, SNP, is campaigning to leave the EU.  It is telling voters not to make this a referendum on independence.  That is one of the foreseeable outcomes, however, and that in itself, with the loss of 31% of Great Britain's territory, would mean that the foreseeable outcome of the UK leaving the European Union is that Scotland will leave the UK.  Consequently, Northern Ireland would then become a real issue, as my colleague from Sinn F&eacute;in has pointed out.  Nobody knows what will happen to the Border.  What would become very obvious to everybody, however, is that a border re-established in Europe when everybody else is getting rid of land borders would be a disaster for Ireland, North and South.  That could precipitate a longer-term discussion about whether Northern Ireland should remain in the UK.  All these issues are quite foreseeable.<\/p> <p>The outcome, therefore, for Mr. Farage and Boris Johnson, when they are talking about trying to leave the EU, is that Scotland and Northern Ireland could leave the UK, which would then comprise only England and Wales.  The country that will lose most, however, and which, outside of Britain, has most to lose, is Ireland because of our strong trade links, the common travel area and the fact that - apart from the Taiwan-China route - the busiest air route in the world is that which operates between Dublin and London.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask Senators to imagine the chaos of having increased security and border checks as a result of Britain deciding to leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#EE00200","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I again repeat that if everybody steals a minute some Senators will be disappointed, as I will not get everybody in.

This has included interventions such as the Taoiseach's article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>, supporting the &quot;Remain&quot; side while being sensitive to the fact that this is a matter for a different jurisdiction.

Some weeks ago I spoke with Trinity alumni in Derry and have been in contact with Trinity alumni branches throughout Britain and Northern Ireland.  I am very heartened to hear back from so many of our graduates there who are so passionately on the &quot;Remain&quot; side and have been doing a great deal of work canvassing other Irish citizens resident in Britain to seek their support for the &quot;Remain&quot; side.  I speak with people such as Nick Beard, whose blog on <i>headstuff.org<\/i>provides very compelling reasons for the UK to remain in the EU.<\/p><p>I speak with Brian O'Connell from the Irish4Europe campaign group.  He has noted that with over 600,000 Irish-born people living and working in Britain, it is a larger group than citizens from many other EU jurisdictions and could be very influential in the result of the referendum, particularly given how close the sides appear to be according to polls.<\/p><p>As many have said, if the UK votes to leave, one of the main concerns for us on this island would be the citizens in the North.  Most of us are very dismayed at the position that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, has taken on the &quot;Leave&quot; side, not seeming to recognise, as the historian, Roy Foster, has said, that a vote for Brexit could be disastrous for the advances we have seen in relations between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  We should not take for granted the huge role the EU has played in British-Irish relations and its role in the peace process.  British and Irish partners sitting as equals side-by-side at international tables of the EU from the early 1980s onwards arguably did more than many things to improve British-Irish relations and to begin processes leading to the Good Friday Agreement.  That is an important factor for us.<\/p><p>It is also important not to be dismissive of all of the arguments on the &quot;Leave&quot; side because clearly there are people on the &quot;Leave&quot; side who genuinely believe in Brexit without adhering to the horrible rhetoric of Mr. Nigel Farage, MEP, and his allies in UKIP.<\/p><p>Some of the arguments on the &quot;Leave&quot; side indicate a very high level of disillusionment with the EU - a sense of a democratic deficit, as Senator Higgins mentioned, a sense of concern about democracy and decisions being made by an unelected Commission.  Many of us feel that consolidated action is required to tackle that.  We need the added voice of Britain at the table to help us in countering that and putting the case, for example, for a social Europe and in putting the case for the need for the EU to have a united front facing crises such as the economic crisis felt so recently and indeed the crisis of so many refugees seeking to enter Europe.<\/p><p>There are also very strong arguments to remain on economic and social grounds, in particular the strong economic evidence so many have pointed to.  The ESRI, for example, has pointed to enormous losses for Ireland as a crucial partner with the UK.  There are many reports on the adverse economic effects for the British economy should the Brexit side prevail.<\/p><p>However, there are also very strong social arguments for remaining in the EU.  We should not forget that the Nobel committee presented the EU with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012, noting the EU's work over six decades in advancing peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.  The EU serves as an example to many other countries of what can be achieved through solidarity and transnational co-operation.<\/p><p>The EU's work in terms of the social Europe and progress for equality and in particular for women's rights should not be taken for granted.  The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has emphasised the progress for women as a result of EU membership.  Also in Britain, Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress published a report entitled Women's Rights and the Risk of Brexit, making the point that Brexit risks turning the clock back decades on hard-won rights.  The socialist movement in Europe has a strong tradition.  The red flag of the Labour Party was first marched under in 1831 in Merthyr Tydfil by oppressed miners and red remains the colour of many of our social democratic partners in Europe, such as the SPD in Germany.  We see a strong sense of European and national identity emerging from these movements around workers' rights, trade union rights and women's rights.<\/p><p>While the decision clearly rests with others tomorrow and not in this jurisdiction, for us the Brexit debate clearly raises many worrying sentiments and we need to challenge some of the arguments for Brexit and meet them with confidence because the European project of an open society of international solidarity of trust and mutual co-operation is an ideal that is worth supporting and worth building upon in co-operation with our neighbours.  We need to have the confidence and leadership here and elsewhere to counter racist and narrow-minded commentary about immigration and we need to plan for a brighter future.<\/p><p>My hope along with that of so many others is that the UK will vote to remain and we can all work together to face the crises that will confront the EU in the rest of the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#FF00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome Councillor McGuire from Westport, who is in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p> <p>I call Senator O'Donnell who has six minutes.

However, there was also an economic context to that.<\/p> <p>We cannot ignore the advance of people such as Mr. Nigel Farage, MEP, and his party, UKIP.  If the UK had our electoral system, UKIP would have seats in Parliament, but this does not happen with the first-past-the-post system.<\/p> <p>We cannot ignore that there is clearly disenchantment with much of what has happened in Europe.

It was set up around a principle preferred by the Germans which was based on an inflation rate of 2%.  There are elements we have to look at.  We cannot ignore why this referendum has come about with ordinary people.<\/p> <p>Taken in its context, I believe it is not good for Europe overall.  Europe overall will be weakened by Britain leaving the European Union.  Britain would also be weakened by leaving the European Union.  For us in Ireland there is no benefit.  It is a question of how exactly it will impact on us, but it will.  It will impact us in a number of areas.  Clearly economically it will impact on us.  If sterling weakens, our exports are less competitive in a British market and that will cost jobs.  We do not know how many jobs, but it will cost jobs.<\/p> <p>In the area of education, many of our students attend college in the UK.  It would probably have implications for fees for their parents and the students themselves.  On travel and free movement, there will be implications for us.

At present, 600,000 people born in Ireland live in Britain, as do 2 million to 3 million second and third generation Irish.  One of the complaints I have is that in debates people are made to go to polarised sides and common-sense debate does not happen.  The normal rules by which people debate almost seem to go out the window.  This morning I heard a man from Britain being interviewed.  He stated that at that moment he did not know how he would vote.  He could not get a clear pattern of the implications it would have.  After the Second World War Winston Churchill called for a united states of Europe and a couple of decades later we have many Conservatives -  he was once of a different party, the Liberals - looking to leave Europe..  They are doing the people of Britain an injustice because I cannot see how they will benefit.  They will not benefit economically or socially.  They will not benefit from European movement.  I am concerned that people will vote on an emotive basis and how they feel about what is happening in Europe.  They might feel certain factors are not working in their interests, but rather than voting on the issue-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#FF00500","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Can I have silence for the speaker?

The Lisbon treaty inserted an article in the treaties which govern the European Union giving each member state the right, in accordance with its own constitutional arrangements, to withdraw from the Union and provided for a two-year negotiated exit mechanism, and if there is to be any extension of that two year period it would have to be done by unanimous agreement of all member states.  I will come back to this.<\/p><p>The interests of the United Kingdom are a matter for the people of the United Kingdom, and they will not listen to what is being said here and change their views on what we will say.  We must be very clear that Ireland's interests are that Brexit would lose us our strongest possible ally at the European Council table.  I know the Minister will agree with me because I speak from experience in this respect.  The United Kingdom and Ireland are close allies on a great many European issues and we cannot afford to be left alone on many of these issues without a strong ally.<\/p><p>People have spoken about Ireland's economic interests.  No matter how close the post-Brexit arrangements would be, and no matter how closely they would approximate to the Norwegian or Swiss arrangements, there would be some form of economic barrier between this State and the United Kingdom.  Those economic barriers will cost jobs and will raise costs for Irish industry.<\/p><p>Ireland's interests are also at stake with regard to Northern Ireland.  Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement would be seriously undermined if the land boundary from Derry to Newry becomes a tectonic plate San Andreas fault and a line of demarcation between two states going in different directions, one harnessed to the European project and another going in a different direction.<\/p><p>An issue that Donald Tusk, the President of the Council, recently mentioned was the people of Europe have been left behind by rhetoric of a federalist kind at the centre of Europe.  People such as Jean-Claude Juncker, Guy Verhofstadt and Daniel Cohn-Bendit have articulated a model of Europe of a strongly integrated superstate federal type, which leaves most people in Europe cold.  It is not just in the United Kingdom there is a difficulty in this respect.  There is also a difficulty in this country.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which is a strongly pro-European newspaper, ran an Ipsos MRBI poll to see where Irish people stood on the issues that had arisen in David Cameron's negotiations with his European partners, and by margins of 2:1 or 3:1 further integration along the federalist line is opposed by the Irish people.  On other issues the Irish people are not aligning themselves to the federalist model which is being articulated on our behalf by some people who are enthusiasts for these projects.<\/p><p>The debate in this country is very stilted.  It is between negative anti-European people on the one hand and wild enthusiasts on the other.  The great majority of Irish people belong in neither camp, and find themselves without a champion and without people who speak up for their view that Europe should not be a federal superstate but should be a partnership between sovereign states, sharing sovereignty where necessary and retaining sovereignty where it is appropriate.  This is the vision of Europe most people have, and it is not just in Ireland this is the case, it is throughout Europe.  The constitutional treaty was rejected in all of the countries where it was attempted, as has been stated.  The Lisbon treaty was a half-hearted attempt to achieve many of the same results.<\/p><p>Mention has been made of the international trade agreement, TTIP.  Recently, I received a circular stating I could go to a room somewhere, I believe in this building, and, provided that I put away my camera and telephone and entered into a pledge of secrecy, I could examine the current state of the negotiations.  All of us received this invitation, very courteously.  This underlines that if there is a democratic deficit in Europe it is strange that elected representatives, Deputies, Senators, and parliamentarians throughout Europe, are not entitled to seen the negotiating documents-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#GG00500","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#GG00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>-----on which their economic future is being decided.

There are different estimates but the figure is between 500,000 and 600,000.  Up to 24% of the British population claim Irish ancestry.  I welcome all the attempts by the Irish in Britain and those by the Government, Ministers and the Taoiseach to engage with the Irish in Britain to try to ensure a positive vote on the \"Remain\" side.  In the case of a Brexit I hope the Government will show the same zeal, if necessary, on a Border poll on a united Ireland.  It may be necessary post Brexit if Britain decides to leave the European Union.  We will push the Government on that on a different day.<\/p><p>Many arguments have been put forward but I have no doubt that Brexit would leave the agrifood sector North and South in a difficult position with respect to access to export markets.  Farmers in the North currently receive &euro;326 million annually in support.  This money is particularly important to the agricultural industry North and South.  Farmers there have also secured &pound;186.5 million in EU funding towards the new rural development programme, which would be sorely missed.<\/p><p>If the vote to leave was returned, it would inevitably lead to customs and immigration checkpoints being re-established on the Border.  This would be a significant setback for the political process in the North.  In all likelihood it would undermine the protection of human rights and workers' rights.  It would also be a significant move away from building an all-Ireland economy, an all-Ireland tourism destination, an improved all-Ireland transport structure and an all-Ireland approach to agriculture and food production.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is an all-Ireland party committed to Irish unity.  We have no wish for only part of Ireland to be in the EU.  We are the only party with MEPs elected in each of the four European constituencies in Ireland.  We speak with one voice - an all-Ireland voice - and perspective within the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in is critical of many aspects of the EU, in particular, the democratic deficit at its core.  However, the possibility that a part of the island of Ireland could end up outside the European Union while the other stays is not a situation that will benefit the people of this island.  People who live on either side of the Border travel back and forward to work, to shop and to visit relatives, often on a daily basis.  Brexit threatens that important movement.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that the Cameron Government plans to repeal the UK Human Rights Act.  A pro-Brexit vote will encourage this proposal and puts at risk crucial human rights legislation that underpins the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>We want to end the power of the British Government to impose its policies in any part of Ireland and we believe Brexit will increase that power.  We want to end partition while Brexit has the power to entrench partition.  Brexit will hamper trade and investment across Ireland.  Successive British Governments have set aside all human rights norms in the North.  That is why the EU Convention on Human Rights is a central tenet of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the event of a Brexit the British Government could repeal the Human Rights Act and walk away from the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>That EU funding was available to address the decades of under-investment by successive British Governments in the North is a crucial consideration.  History demonstrates that the loss of EU funding in the North will not be replaced by London.  Recent estimates put the cost of a Brexit to the northern economy at &euro;1 billion per annum and the cost to the southern economy at &euro;3 billion per annum.  In the event of a Brexit, the agricultural sector in the North stands to lose &euro;326 million in direct agricultural support payments.  These are some of the arguments we put forward.

On the occasion of my first visit to the recently-established Seanad I was struck by the number of Senators present for the debate.  It underlines the importance of it.  While I am looking around I wish to avail of the opportunity to wish all the new Senators and other Members a fulfilling time personally and professionally.  Although, looking at some of the faces, it may be more appropriate for me to wish them something of a short tenure.  I know many of them would wish to take the opportunity to travel across to the Lower House.<\/p> <p>In closing the debate, I wish to address briefly the core elements of what might take place after the referendum and once the result is known later this week.  In the event of our preferred outcome, that is to say, a vote for the UK to remain firmly and positively as a member of the European Union, the next steps are somewhat straightforward.  The settlement concluded in February by the EU Heads of State and Government will take effect immediately.  The agreed measures relating to the economic governance, competitiveness, sovereignty and freedom of movement would be effective straightaway.  In parallel, work would progress on amending or complementing existing EU regulations to implement the measures agreed in respect of social benefits and addressing the abuse of free movement.<\/p> <p>I have been struck by the number of Members who called for a reformed Europe to take a more socially sensitive path.  That has been mentioned by several Members.  On behalf of the Government I wish to not only note the point but to say that it is something that I will take in hand.<\/p> <p>We need to consider plans in the event of a vote to leave by the people of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland as well as those British citizens who reside in this country.  In the event of there being a desire on the part of these people to leave the European Union, the next steps are obviously more uncertain and less clear.  Procedurally, the expectation is that withdrawal negotiations will take place in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union following a formal notification to the European Union on the part of the United Kingdom of its intention to leave.  This point was referred to by Senator McDowell.<\/p> <p>Negotiations on the future of the UK-EU relationship would also be required.  These would probably take place in parallel with the withdrawal negotiations.  The two sets of negotiations would be expected to last for a period of two years.  However, as Senator McDowell has said, I believe we may well be dealing with a far longer timeframe.  It is important in this regard that we emphasise that the United Kingdom does not leave the European Union immediately if it votes to leave on Thursday.  It continues to remain a member state throughout the withdrawal negotiation period.  The least that can be said at this point is that this would be a lengthy and complex process.  In the event of a vote to leave on Friday, EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, will be in a position to discuss the outcome together almost immediately when they meet next week at the European Council.<\/p> <p>One thing is certain: regardless of the outcome, Ireland's position on EU membership is unwavering.  As part of a competitive diversified global economy we will continue to remain committed members of the European Union and a full member of the eurozone.  Ireland will also have a clear plan in place to deal with the implications in the event of there being a vote to leave.  A framework has been developed on a whole-of-government basis across a range of Departments to identify contingencies that may arise in the days, weeks and months that follow.  As I stated earlier, the key priority for the Government at all times will be to protect and promote Ireland's key interests.<\/p> <p>On Friday, however, I hope that we will be continuing our journey together as a renewed union of 28 member states, including the United Kingdom, working to face the many challenges that face our respective citizens, not only in Ireland but throughout the 28 European Union member states.  In spite of some misgivings on the part of Members, everyone has stated it is their wish that the UK should vote to remain.  In that regard I would remind Senators that they have an opportunity to perhaps consider phoning a friend over the next 24 or 48 hours &ndash; someone who is on the register, a friend, relative or an associate in the UK.  Senators might like to take the opportunity to do no more than impress upon them the importance of British-Irish relations in the context of this very important vote in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#HH00800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466587800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Waste Management: Motion","time":1466587800,"counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#JJ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that Statutory Instrument No. 24 of 2016 &ndash; Waste Management (Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 &ndash; be annulled.<\/blockquote> <p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Kyne.

Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil s&eacute; ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; dramha&iacute;ola chomh maith c&eacute;anna sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht &aacute;irithe seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte &oacute;n aithne at&aacute; agam air go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; a mh&iacute;le d&iacute;cheall &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh cuid mhaith d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta againn anseo ar na h&aacute;bhair sin.<\/p><p>Mar is eol don Aire St&aacute;it, is d&oacute;cha gur th&aacute;inig an cheist seo chun solais i gceantair an iarthair - i gceantar na Gaillimhe, ach go h&aacute;irithe - i bhfianaise an obair taighde an-mhaith a rinne Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; dramha&iacute;ola.  T&aacute; a fhios againn gur thug an t-iar Aire, an Teachta Alan Kelly, isteach an ionstraim reacht&uacute;il seo nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; i mbun Aireachta chun athr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gc&oacute;ras a bhaineann leis na ceadanna a fhaigheann na comhlachta&iacute; bailithe bruscair &oacute; thaobh bruscar a bhaili&uacute;.  Is d&oacute;cha gur th&aacute;inig s&eacute; seo isteach faoin radar nuair a raibh an oiread sin cainte ann faoi c&eacute; mbeadh n&oacute; nach mbeadh i Rialtas.  Bh&iacute; daoine ag iarraidh an mbeadh Miche&aacute;l n&oacute; aon duine eile ann, n&oacute; p&eacute; rud &eacute;.  Murach gur thosaigh dreamanna cos&uacute;il le &quot;Inis Aniar&quot; ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta ag d&eacute;anamh fiosruithe faoi seo, agus gur thosaigh daoine sa phobal ag ard&uacute; ceisteanna, n&iacute; bheadh s&eacute; tagtha chun solais chomh m&oacute;r go raibh an rud seo le bheith chomh &eacute;ag&oacute;rach.<\/p><p>T&aacute; riar mhaith comhlachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha ar fud na t&iacute;re ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; dramha&iacute;ola i bhfianaise socruithe a rinneadh roimhe seo pr&iacute;obh&aacute;idi&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gc&oacute;ras agus an fheidhm sin a bhaint de na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la, rud nach mbeimid ar a son go huile is go hioml&aacute;n.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; beartaithe sa sc&eacute;al seo go dtos&oacute;fa&iacute; ag athr&uacute; an ch&oacute;rais.  Is d&oacute;cha gurb &eacute; an rud is fearr le d&eacute;anamh n&aacute; sampla Chonamara a thabhairt.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i gceist t&aacute;ille seasta a thabhairt isteach ag an dream a bh&iacute; ag f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh leis an dramha&iacute;l i gConamara.  Tuigtear go raibh s&eacute; sin le bheith suas le &euro;224 in &aacute;iteanna &aacute;irithe sula raibh bosca bruscair ar bith pioctha suas.  Bh&iacute; &eacute;ag&oacute;ir breise ansin &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; dramha&iacute;ola chomh maith - s&eacute; sin go mbeid&iacute;s si&uacute;d at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; n&iacute;os faide &oacute;n baile m&oacute;r ag &iacute;oc n&iacute;os m&oacute; mar th&aacute;ille seasta.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an phointe sin go raibh na t&aacute;ill&iacute; a bh&iacute; an chomhlacht &aacute;irithe seo ag iarraidh a bhaint de mhuintir Chonamara &eacute;ag&oacute;rach amach is amach.  Ar an taobh eile, fuaireamar amach go bhfuil an chomhlacht c&eacute;anna at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; ar an taobh sin t&iacute;re ag cur seirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il i gContae Liatroma.  Bh&iacute; muintir Liatroma ag f&aacute;il margadh i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr agus fair play d&oacute;ibh.  Bh&iacute; t&aacute;ille seasta de &euro;80 &aacute; bhaint de mhuintir Liatroma ar an tseirbh&iacute;s ceannann c&eacute;anna sular arda&iacute;odh aon araid bhruscair.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair oibri&uacute; amach c&eacute;n chaoi a bhf&eacute;adfadh comhlacht an m&eacute;id sin a bhaint amach i gContae Liatroma agus i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; - beagnach tr&iacute; oiread an m&eacute;id c&eacute;anna - a bhaint amach i gConamara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#JJ00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Senator, but there does not seem to be any translation service.

In the past few weeks there has been public discourse after it emerged that many of the waste collection companies would double or treble the cost of waste disposal services.  That did not come from nowhere; it did not come from left field.  Let us remember that the legislation was deferred for an entire year.  I would have thought, therefore, that the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, over the heads of his senior departmental officials, would have brought in representatives of the waste management companies and local authorities and said the following to them:<\/p><blockquote>This is what we intend to do and these are the objectives.  We are doing really well in the case of dry recyclables.  We are doing well in recycling plastic, paper and cardboard.  We are doing a really good job because years ago the necessary infrastructure was put in place, but we are not doing well in the case of organic waste.  We are also not doing well in recycling food waste, garden cuttings and clippings and need to do a lot better.  We need you to roll out a three bin system.  In Dublin, for a certain type of recycling service, the bins are green, but in Donegal they are blue.  The brown bins take organic waste; the black bins take whatever is left and their contents must go to landfill.<\/blockquote> <p>It has been a legal requirement for over one year, where one lives in a town with a population of over 1,500, to ensure one's waste is separated.  One must ensure organic waste is put in a brown bin, that dry recyclables are put in a blue or a green bin and that the rest of the waste is put in a black bin.  Tens of thousands of families have yet to see a brown bin.  They cannot, therefore, comply with the law, even if they wanted to and most of them want to do so.  In a week's time people who live in a town with a population of over 500 must comply with the legislation.  Can one imagine the number of towns that will now join the list?  Can one imagine the tens of thousands of households who are supposed to comply with the legislation but cannot do so?  <\/p><p>Today the bin provider in my part of County Donegal received an inquiry.  A member of staff said that not only could they not give a date when brown bins would be delivered but that they would not do so as the company did not have the capacity to do so.  The infrastructure is not in place in the county to make such provision.  In one week the new legislation will come into force, but not a single brown bin has been delivered in County Donegal.  The council was then contacted and a member of its staff said: &quot;We have people on leave, out sick, etc. and cannot oversee it.&quot;  That shows that there is no oversight and regulation of waste companies in the State.<\/p><p>Many good citizens may be listening to this debate, or perhaps they have better things to do, but those listening may think to themselves: &quot;I recycle plastic, paper and cardboard, so I am a good citizen.&quot;  Despite this, significant amounts of recyclables are incinerated in waste energy plants instead of being recycled.  There are big questions marks in that regard.  <\/p><p>What is the level of oversight?  If a local authority does not have oversight of waste management companies and they have no inclination to implement the law the Government is insisting on bringing forward, the entire initiative is a farce.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled the motion to have the statutory instrument annulled.  We want the secondary legislation to give effect to the changes to be annulled and withdrawn and to go back to the drawing board.  In so doing one would avoid the last minute panic in bringing in representatives of the waste management companies to ask them to freeze the charges for one year.  I do not want the Minister to paper over the cracks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister must negotiate properly, which will mean speaking to departmental officials, managers of county councils and directors of services in local authorities.  He must also tell the waste companies what they must do.  If this is done properly, it would have the potential to increase recycling rates, which currently stand at between 40% and 50%.  We can do better than that by minimising the amount of waste going to landfill and being incinerated.  Those who came before us set this process in motion.  They pursued laudable objectives but were failed by a lethargic Department and lethargic Ministers.<\/p><p>One would have expected the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to embrace the motion on the basis that it is common sense and to have called on the Government to go back to the drawing board.  I read the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment on the Order Paper and agree with most of it.  However, the party has decided that the new politics in the Houses will be that its motions will be passed with the collusion of the Government and the Government's agenda will be passed with the collusion of Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, God forbid that a Bill or motion is tabled by any other part of the Opposition because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will vote it down.

If, as expected, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael unite again to vote down a sensible Opposition proposal that would have us go back to the drawing board for the reasons I have outlined, the Minister will have to tell householders in County Donegal and elsewhere who live in urban conglomerations with a population exceeding 500 what they should do with their organic waste.

I know he has been closely engaged with this issue since long before the recent events highlighted by the Opposition and others.<\/p> <p>We need to examine how we behave and manage waste.  The starting point was our unsustainable dependence on landfill.  This has left many local authorities with major legacy issues, with which many Senators will be familiar.  We are still paying the price for unsustainable practices in waste management.  As a result of the various initiatives, including the green schools programme, we need only ask our children what the solution to our waste problem is.  Reduce, reuse, recycle and compost is how we will divert waste from landfill.  However, we must also have in place a formal system that will allow us to manage waste in a responsible manner.  We cannot afford to continue our dependence on landfill because it is unsustainable, costly and bad for the environment.<\/p> <p>Waste collection systems have been introduced nationwide.  As a former member of a local authority for eight years, I recall when change was first proposed in the area of waste management.  When we introduced recycling and charges, Sinn F&eacute;in engaged in populist opposition to the changes.  We are elected to be responsible.  We cannot be populist all the time and while people have legitimate concerns about waste charges, Sinn F&eacute;in is not offering any solutions.  It engages in rhetoric that appeals to emotions and exploits distress without offering solutions.  Over time, people will see through this.<\/p> <p>I support the Minister in his endeavours, especially his efforts in recent days to engage with the stakeholders and the waste management industry.  As we know, this is not about increasing charges but about changing the behaviour of householders in terms of how they manage their waste by encouraging and incentivising a reduction in waste going to landfill.  Ultimately, this will be good for all of us, including future generations.<\/p> <p>I remember trying to adopt waste management plans and introducing the first recycling bags in County Waterford, which I represented on the council.  We introduced what I considered to be a fairly small charge.  Even then, we faced major opposition from Sinn F&eacute;in because there was resistance to change.  In the interim, it has been demonstrated that recycling, for which we charged initially, has been extremely successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#LL00600","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>It was privatisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#LL00700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I do not hear Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledging the significant progress made by local authorities in diverting waste from landfill.  This success and progress should be acknowledged.  Instead, the party acts opportunistically by jumping on people's fears and concerns and hyping up the issue to change it into something else.  I am entitled to hold that opinion.<\/p> <p>Statistics show that in 2011, when the most recent survey was carried out, 46% of households were paying a flat fee, 34% were paying for either a tag or on a per-lift basis and 20% were on the pay-by-weight charging system.  Studies have shown that the introduction of a pay-by-weight system would mean the diversion of more than 450,000 tonnes of waste from landfill every year.  That is the nub of the issue.  The Minister's engagement with the waste companies and commitment to introduce a dual pricing policy will help communicate and raise awareness of how to change behaviour to divert waste from landfill.  If we are all being honest, we must ask whether we compost waste at home and engage in all of the actions we advocate in the Oireachtas.  The home is where waste management starts, which leads be back to schoolchildren and how they could teach us all a lesson or two on sustainability, waste management and caring for the environment.<\/p> <p>Hysteria is being stoked about something that is not an issue.  A regulation is being introduced in accordance with the polluter-pays principle, with which, as has been shown by the support for the waste collection systems introduced ten or 15 years ago in the face of significant opposition from Sinn F&eacute;in, most people agree.  The diversion of waste from landfill works.  I urge politicians to behave responsibly and lead the way, as children are doing in schools, on sustainability and waste management.<\/p> <p>As I stated, the fundamental issue is the polluter-pays principle which incentivises and encourages people to reduce the waste being placed in bins and transported to landfill.  The pay-by-weight system is a means of achieving this and gives people more control over their waste costs.  Those who try to manage their waste in a positive and progressive manner will find their charges will fall because they will send less waste to landfill.  This will, in turn, reduce the costs to the State arising from landfill management and remediation costs.  We are building up a legacy for the future.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify how many millions have been spent in the past ten or 20 years on remediating landfill sites.  A number of such sites have been remediated in my local area at substantial cost.  While some have been turned into beautiful amenities, all of this has come at a cost to the Exchequer and taxpayers.  If we do not manage waste, we will ultimately pay the cost in any event.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately, we are paying for it if we do not manage it and that is a fact.  The taxpayer will pay the price, ultimately.  There are also many private landfill sites around the country which must be managed and remediated.  We have a long way to go in dealing with the legacy we were left with terms of bad practice and bad waste management over many years.<\/p><p>Another issue that must be reviewed is that of franchise bidding versus side-by-side kerb side collections.  In the larger urban areas numerous competing bin-collection companies are operating in the same areas which is causing frustration for householders.  A review took place under the regulatory impact analysis of 2012 which recommended that we continue with the existing system.  However, the next 12 months will provide an opportunity to review that system again to see if there is a more efficient and better way of doing things through franchise bidding in the market.  <\/p><p>I reiterate that it was never the Government's intention to increase charges to householders.  We all have a responsibility to be honest and open with the public.  We are supposed to show the way so rather than creating hysteria we should be communicating, as the Minister is proposing, what the proposed system can bring in terms of benefits for householders if they manage their waste and reduce the amount going to landfill, thus reducing the cost.  The open market can function by competing for household waste business which should also drive down the cost.<\/p><p>It is very important that we acknowledge the enormous progress that has been made in the last ten to 15 years in recycling and the diversion of waste from landfill sites.  We have advanced very significantly and that should be acknowledged by the Opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#LL00800","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I now call Senator Murnane O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#MM00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>It is insulting to call people hysterical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#MM00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Order, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#MM00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the replacement of flat-rate bin charges with pay-by-weight bin charges for households.  This will reduce residual waste going to landfills, give householders more control over their waste costs and reward those who recycle.  However, we acknowledge that the implementation of the new charging regime has been highly problematic due to the opacity and lack of transparency of the new pricing models.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the price freeze for customers for the next 12 months, based on current pricing plans.  During the second half of 2016, the waste industry will engage in an intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign to promote the benefits of the pay-by-weight charging model, supporting customers in understanding how they can change their waste management behaviour and better manage their waste costs.  No later than 1 January 2017, customers will receive a dual pricing plan detailing the costs under the current model and the pay-by-weight model of disposing of the waste they generate and be given the opportunity to switch to the pay-by-weight system.  This is very productive and will give householders the chance to ensure that they pay less for household waste disposal.  Following the 12 month transition period, a review will take place which will inform decisions regarding arrangements from 1 July 2017, including the requirement for comprehensive billing information on the pay-by-weight system, through amendments to the relevant statutory instrument.  It is intended to keep the operation of the price freeze under review, with further legislative interventions to be considered if necessary.  The waste industry has made a commitment to providing a weight allowance to 60,000 HSE patients supplied with incontinence wear in order to reduce their waste charges and the Government has agreed to a 50% reduction in the landfill levy on waste companies in respect of such waste.  <\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il calls on the Minister to introduce a waiver scheme for low-income households, those with special needs, larger households and those with babies which could be negatively affected by the new charging structure.  This is a very important issue for Fianna F&aacute;il and for those who have attended our clinics and argued that the new system will be unfair to them.  Fianna F&aacute;il also calls for a mechanism to be put in place to ensure that apartment dwellers and those who cannot store wheelie bins are provided with a fair pricing system.  We also need to examine the issue of bags because we were told that from 1 July this year bin bags would no longer be collected.  The Government must introduce measures to increase the diversion of food and compostable waste from landfill and to encourage the reuse and recycling of green waste.  Such measures could include ministerial orders compelling waste collectors to provide separate compostable waste bins to areas that do not currently have them and to enable householders to recycle glass in their green waste bins.  <\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in never comes up with answers.

It is simply the new reality.<\/p><p>I wish to put three points to the Minister.  It is important to have a fair national pay-by-weight collection system.  That is simple.  It must be in line with the \"polluter pays\" principle.  It must be based on fairness and the ability and capacity of people to pay.  It must have regard for people who cannot pay and who may need a generous waiver scheme.<\/p><p>Today, I have tried to think how to encapsulate in one sentence what I believe people want, or what the people who have contacted my office say they want, and I am going to attempt to say it in one sentence.  The Government's objective should be to secure a reasonable, free and fair allowance per person for waste and a fair unit price for any excess.  I have not heard too many people talk about that.  There should be a reasonable free element and then payment for any excess above that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#MM01800","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for giving me part of his time.

Senator Boyhan says he does not mind paying.  I do not mind paying for things either.  We pay for water through the water tax.  We pay for bins through the bin tax.  We pay for roads through the car tax.  Then we have the property tax.  Hello.  What is the property tax for?  If we pay for everything else, why are we paying property tax?  People's homes should be sacrosanct.<\/p> <p>Anyway, the real reason I have stood up today relates to a letter I sent to the Minister.  I am unsure whether he has even caught sight of it.  I sent it approximately one month ago and I also sent a copy to Andrew Rae of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  I raised questions about a proposed merger between Panda and Greenstar.  This raises serious questions and I welcome the opportunity to put them on the record of the House.<\/p> <p>I have ten questions for the Minister.  Is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission satisfied that in this matter competition rules have been appropriately enforced?  Is it true that Panda required and was given detailed operational information by Greenstar?  Was the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission informed of this?  Has the commission, as a result, audited company e-mails and records?  That is an important point.  I believe certain things would be revealed if there were such an audit and I call on the Minister to indicate to the House whether such an audit has taken place or will take place.<\/p> <p>If this merger goes ahead, Panda will control the Dublin waste stream with the three biggest waste transfer stations in Dublin, namely: Greenstar, Millennium Park, north Dublin; Panda, Ballymount, west Dublin; and Greenstar, Bray, covering south Dublin and Bray, County Wicklow.<\/p> <p>Waste is an asset, a point not fully understood outside the industry.  Control of the disposal depots for sorting, recycling and bulking up for onward disposal after recycling means all small operations have to pay the waste in-take price.  All kinds of waste, including domestic waste, will be set by Panda.  Does this not constitute a monopoly?<\/p> <p>In addition, I understand that Panda has an agreement to supply the Dublin incinerator with 400,000 tonnes of a 600,000 tonnes annual requirement, thereby allowing Panda to set the price to incinerator operators over time and, therefore, to set the price for the taxpayer.  A Greenstar Panda merger will mean the firm will have a monopoly on this waste stream.  Without a Greenstar Panda merger there is open competition for waste contracts and the waste stream to supply it.  This would drive down the price to European waste disposal levels.  Is this a matter of concern to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission?  Panda will control over 90% of domestic waste customers in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area after the proposed merger.  It has been told that it will have to sell a portion of these customers.  Should Greenstar not have been required to sell the customers under supervision?  Were data protection regulations taken into consideration during the process?<\/p> <p>The new charging mechanism for green bins has recently been signed into law allowing for charging by weight, etc.  Does market research not show that with the new rules waste volumes will drop by 25% initially due to consumer over-reaction to a perceived higher charge?  Then, as consumers get used to the charges, they will readjust and volumes will recover over a short period.  Waste companies will price in the reduction in volume to recover their losses in volume and increase their margin but they will not readjust as volumes recover.  In practice, the real cost of waste disposal to the consumer is set to increase significantly.  Is it not true that in acquiring Greenstar, Panda will also gain 30% of the Cork market and 40% of the south-east market, making it the biggest waste operator in the country with an ability to crush its competition, as many of the waste collectors are small and unable to sustain a major competitor?<\/p> <p>Finally, in assessing the size of the merged entity, I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission took into consideration or included the Kildare and Wicklow regions as well as parts of Westmeath and Louth, i.e., all of the surrounding counties.  Does this not dilute the real picture, as the analysis should have been done on the Dublin boroughs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#NN00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>On a point of order, would you not agree, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that it would be fair for the leaders of the six groups to be allowed to speak before the Minister comes in?

It is an important point given the industry we are talking about.

In fairness, that is their ideology and it always has been.  It has been a disaster.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to recall the dispute with Greyhound only two years ago.  There were 14 weeks of strikes.  Workers were sacked unceremoniously.  It was all because the company was trying to impose pay cuts.  What we have seen in the waste industry in recent years - since privatisation - is a race to the bottom in terms and conditions in order to reduce costs.  This has resulted in squeezing workers at the very margins.  I have heard people from Fine Gael talk about the waste industry but I have yet to hear anyone from Fine Gael ever talk about workers' rights.  Is that ever going to happen?

Again, it is nothing we will ever hear about from Fine Gael.  Having said that, I invite the Minister, if he so wishes, to make an announcement of support for a joint labour committee.  All Members would welcome it, but somehow I think that is unlikely.  It is a scandalous industry, an industry with terms and conditions that have been destroyed.

There are serious consequences to annulling this statutory instrument, for whatever reason.

Last week I answered questions in the D&aacute;il regarding the concerns that were understandably building over the introduction on a mandatory basis of a switch-over to a new charging structure requiring pay by weight, which links back to a statutory instrument that was introduced last January for all the right reasons, in an effort to try to encourage the shift-over for about 80% of people who have bins collected and who are not yet on a pay-by-weight pricing model.  Most of those would not have seen a change in their pricing structure at all under this switch.  For what it is worth, most people, as far as I have heard from them, who have switched to a pay-by-weight model in the last number of years do not want to switch back.  They see the benefits of it.  They have been encouraged to adopt, and have willingly adopted, a different approach to waste management that involves separation at source in the home and the use of three different bins.  I accept what Senator Mac Lochlainn has been saying.

We have responded to the genuine concerns that we heard last week as a Government.  People from all parties and none asked me to engage with the industry and ensure that no household would be ripped off as we try to move to a pay-by-weight charging structure.  That is exactly what I did.  Last Friday, the day after those questions were raised, we met the waste industry for at least three hours.  I had a very direct discussion with them.  I told them that under no circumstances would the Government allow a situation whereby households would be mandated to switch over to a new charging system that would result in dramatic increases for many households.  It would not happen, and it has not happened, and people are talking in this debate as if it will happen.  It will not.  What is now happening is that there is an acceptance by Government that we are not prepared to make the transition on a mandatory basis to a charging structure based on pay by weight.  Some companies are clearly seeking to hike up charges during the confusion and the change of structure and were pointing to the Government as requiring them to do that.  I made it very clear that was not acceptable.<\/p> <p>What we now have, therefore, is an agreement and a deal with the industry that there will be no increases in waste fees or charges for the next 12 months.  During that time, for the first six months we will focus on raising awareness, education and promotion of why it is good to consider switching to pay by weight, and in the second six months of that charge freeze waste companies will be required to offer what is called a dual billing system, whereby people will be able to see what they are paying at the moment and what they would be paying if they chose to switch to a pay-by-weight model.  On top of that, we have an agreement from the industry that anybody who wants to opt into pay by weight can do so, and the industry will be required to allow this.  Therefore, instead of requiring households to change their behaviour and encouraging or punishing that through a mandated charging system, we are essentially encouraging them to do it of their own accord and encouraging the industry to facilitate that changeover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#PP03200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The Minister has one minute left, but I will allow him two minutes because he was interrupted on a number of occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#PP03300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The point I am making is that the approach that was being proposed that resulted in such a negative reaction from many households who had genuine concerns is now not happening.

I still find it shocking that our country lacks an effective responsible waste management policy in this, the 21st century.  We need a waste management policy that operates in the best interests of our economy, citizens and environment, and a policy that treats waste as a potential valuable resource that can be turned around creating indigenous employment supporting local sustainable jobs.  The goodwill on the part of our citizens has been ruined absolutely by events such as those of recent months.  The trust that prices will not shoot up suddenly is undermined and eroded.  There is so much outrage over this issue and I completely understand it.  Many of our citizens are well aware of their responsibilities with regard to the disposal of their household waste and know the benefits of recycling, not only the economic benefits but also the feel good factor of doing the right thing.  Citizens are prepared to pay a fair and reasonable charge to ensure their waste is disposed of properly.<\/p> <p>A pay-by-weight system is, in principle, a good way to ensure those generating excessive amounts of waste pay for what they generate leaving the average householder to pay a fair price.   This should not be undermined by an excessive hike in the service charges.  Once again, the Government has landed us in a dilemma due to its failure to have recognised the importance of the issue.  It is blatantly obvious the Government should have intervened earlier to properly regulate the waste services market.  The Government failed to consult the industry, one of the key stakeholders.  It should have negotiated capping service charges at a much earlier stage.  I understand the Minister has had very fruitful talks in recent days, but it is very late and has caused much concern among citizens.  The Government failed not only to consult in a timely manner with the industry but with all stakeholders involved.  As a result, citizens find themselves once again having to take to the streets.<\/p> <p>Earlier this week, I had the honour of raising the sixth green flag at Gl&oacute;r Na Mara primary school in Tramore, County Waterford.  Pupils there received their global citizen award for litter and waste management.  I cannot help think it is the green schoolchildren of Ireland who are showing us real leadership on how to handle our waste. The Government should not fail future generations and should lead by example.<\/p> <p>I welcome the freeze on the annual service charges announced yesterday as a first step.  It gives time to work out a proper response to fixing the challenges in our waste management policy.  Some may see this as kicking the can down the road.  I see it as recognising the concerns of citizens and taking the time to prepare an effective solution in consultation with all the key stakeholders and in the best interests of the public and the environment.<\/p> <p>We need greater regulation of the waste market.  The Government should consider establishing a waste market regulator to ensure fairer outcomes for citizens.  We need to explore and examine ways to overcome the legal obstacles to introducing a franchise bidding model of waste collection.  This would allow companies to compete for a single contract covering a set area for a set time.  Like many EU countries, we need to examine ways to reduce the amount of unnecessary packaging that enters the market in the first place.  We need to use this time to build a public awareness campaign on the best ways to reduce the amount of waste generated in homes.<\/p> <p>We need to find ways to encourage and incentivise enterprise and industry to create sustainable Irish jobs using this potentially valuable resource.  I ask the Government to stop wasting our time.  Let us use this time to find right solutions to waste management in Ireland.  I understand very well why my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in have tabled this motion on the annulment of this statutory instrument.  Even though I share their concerns about the impact of higher charges on ordinary householders, I cannot support the motion.  However, I look forward to working with them in the Chamber to try to put forward real solutions that will result in an affordable, effective and environmentally sound waste management policy for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#QQ01400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I congratulated the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and I do so again today.  I also congratulate Senator McFadden on becoming the Whip for the Seanad.  I also congratulate the Minister, not only on his appointment but on brokering this deal which will give comfort to people while we have an opportunity to tease out the problems and fears people have about this issue.<\/p> <p>I will not reiterate with the Minister said about the motivation behind the motion, but it is important to reiterate what is envisaged is not a new charge but a new way of charging and that we need, as my colleague has just said, more recycling to reduce landfill waste and to make householders more conscious of how they can help in this way.<\/p> <p>The main purpose of the pay-by-weight system is to encourage householders to recycle and compost more.  I know some households do not have the capacity to compost, but many households do and very often this is underutilised.  I am very reassured there is no charge for the green bin because many households are only coming to terms with learning how to recycle and we need to keep this incentive for them.  I commend the Minister on this.  He has already mentioned the issue regarding people with specific medical problems and needs, particularly with regard to incontinence, which will be addressed and I welcome this also.<\/p> <p>When the price freeze is over the Government will do all in its power to keep prices down.  In my area of Fingal, Mr. Stephen Peppard is responsible for recycling plants, one of which is in the estuary.  It takes all types of waste, including electrical, plastic and wood.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about transparency.  I am very pleased the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the NSAI, has a role in ensuring the equipment used to weigh bins will be properly monitored, as fuel outlets are to ensure pumps are accurate rather than interfered with.  However, I believe there is an issue which needs to be addressed and it may fall within the Minister's remit.  I am referring to the fact that so many of the companies have offshore ownership, meaning we have no transparency over their profits.  If we want trust, their profits should be open to us to inspect.  If they are trying to make a case for increased charges I do not see why we should not know their current profit margins.  They will argue, as they did to Shane Phelan in an excellent article he wrote on 13 July 2015, that they want to protect sensitive commercial information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Let us call a spade a spade.

Thankfully, my hearing in one ear is poor so I will not hear any interruptions the Senators opposite may make.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister and agree with his comment that if the statutory instrument were annulled, it would be open season for the operators.  Those were not his words but that was the nub of his argument.  A previous speaker suggested to the Minister that research is needed on this issue.  The previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, carried out research before introducing the statutory instrument.  Based on this research and three pilot projects in three different local authority areas, 83% of citizens would be better off if the statutory instrument were implemented as intended.  However, the service providers viewed the interregnum after the election and before the appointment of a new Government as an opportunity to increase standing charges.<\/p> <p>The pay-by-weight system is the fairest available.  Providers do not have a right to increase standing charges and I commend the Minister on seeing them off on that issue.  I have no doubt they will try it on again.<\/p> <p>The previous Minister specifically informed the service providers that if they attempted to change standing charges, he would rescind the other elements of this statutory instrument.  The industry made its move and attempted to introduce unacceptable charges in the vacuum created by the absence of a Government.  That is the nub of the problem.<\/p> <p>I propose to delve into history a little, as Senator Coffey did.  In the mid-1990s, local authorities provided an efficient and effective nationwide waste service.  Staff were gainfully employed, trade unions were recognised, proper rates of pay applied and, most important, a waiver scheme was in place in every local authority area.  Across the country, however, the Trots and certain elements within Sinn F&eacute;in started a protest campaign against waste charges and successfully closed down every local authority waste collection system.  Yesterday, one of the leading representatives of the waste companies stated that Cork County Council's waste management service was &euro;12 million in the red.  Before the waste management service in my small local authority of Carrick-on-Suir closed, its share of the market stood at approximately 30%, with the remainder held by the private sector, and some 60% of its users were on a waiver scheme at the time of its closure.  The service was closed down as a result of protests by the Trots and Sinn F&eacute;in elements.  What happened to the protesters when the private sector entered the market?  They disappeared and were never heard from again.  Local authority waste collection services were closed down and transferred to an unregulated private sector that is cherry-picking the best areas and that refuses to provide services in rural areas.  We have to fight to get it to operate in rural areas.<\/p> <p>As Senator Reilly noted, almost half of the 13 major waste collection companies operating here are offshore entities unregulated by Revenue.  Despite this, these companies are securing contracts and licences through two regional authorities and local authorities.  Regulation is needed not only in respect of the prices paid by customers, although this is extremely important, but also in respect of staff in the private waste collection companies who are required to work at low rates of pay and in atrocious conditions.  The industry must be pulled together and registered employment agreements introduced, if necessary by the State or by a regulator under the collective bargaining system introduced by Senator Nash when he was a Minister of State in the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>In 1997, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Martin Cullen, transferred responsibility for waste collection to county managers because he believed elected local authority members would not take decisions on this matter.  County managers determined the waste management policy that would apply in the various regions and subsequently decided - correctly because the system was impossible to run - to allow the service to be privatised.  That is a little history lesson for certain Senators on whom the history of the issue may have been lost and for some genuine Senators.  In this regard, I commend Senator Gavan on his bona fides.  He represented workers in a previous life in SIPTU, particularly Greyhound workers in Dublin who were forced to work under poor conditions.<\/p> <p>A regulator is needed to regulate prices, ensure uniform standards apply nationwide and provide for proper terms and conditions for workers.  These three issues are paramount.  We must study this issue in the next 12 months in order that the Minister or his successor are ready to act when the suspension period concludes.  We should not start to review the system at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#RR00800","speaker":"1387"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  <\/p> <p>As a new Senator, I thought I had a good grasp of politics but it seems I will have to go back to the drawing board.

This has been an interesting debate.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I grew to know him when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the past five years in my role as agriculture spokesperson in the House and always found him to be hands on and that he dealt with issues efficiently and effectively in the public interest.  He has done so in this regard also.<\/p> <p>The statutory instrument was not ideal and the circumstances in which it was introduced were wrong.  It was rushed through.  There may have been consultation with the industry operators, but that is not what they are saying.  Nonetheless, we found ourselves in a  precarious position which had to be dealt with swiftly.  The negotiations between our spokesperson, Deputy Barry Cowen, the Minister and his officials have resulted in the best solution to this dilemma.  The alternative before us, if we were to vote in favour of it, is to annul SI 24.  However, as previous speakers said, it covers much more than some Members would like people to believe.  The Minister alluded to this.  For example, it deals with permits for the collection of waste, a central pillar of our waste management strategy, the tax clearance certification of those who collect our waste, fines, local authority powers and the national hazardous waste management plan, the provisions relating to which would all be annulled if we were to vote in favour of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  That would do a disservice to the environment, the industry and, more importantly, consumers because every rogue dealer up and down the country would be able to collect waste and fleece them from tomorrow morning.  We could not stand over this and support that position.  We engage in realistic politics.  I got into politics to engage with others of different political persuasions to try to ensure a better outcome for the citizens we all represent.  That is the new politics the House is seeing tonight.  It is about responsibility and trying to sit down with those of different political persuasions to hammer out a deal that will benefits the vast majority of the people.<\/p> <p>A study was carried out in 2009 of waste management and how to move forward.  The most efficient and effective way to collect waste for the consumer, the industry, the environment and the State is by using a pay-by-weight system.  We cannot row back on this and even to annul that provision in the statutory instrument would be wrong.  There is a road map for the next 12 months, but serious dialogue must be engaged in.  The Fianna F&aacute;il group in this House and the D&aacute;il will not be found wanting in that regard.  We must have the transparency the window of the next 12 months will open up.

I come from a local authority background, having been a councillor from October 2003 until my recent election to the Seanad.  Some other colleagues from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Senators Boyhan and Richmond, are also in the Chamber.  That council introduced pay by weight in 2005.  Prior to then, one paid &euro;300 per year for as much as one could dump in any bin one liked.  I do not think we even had green bins at the time.  We must acknowledge the progress that has been made.  Initially, green bins did not even take plastic.  Much has changed for the better.  When we are monitored, we behave in a certain way.  People examined their bin weights and started buying compost bins.  They discovered that there was a benefit, not just in reducing waste by composting, but in having compost for use in a garden.<\/p> <p>The amount of scaremongering has been outrageous.  Of course we must take into account people with medical issues or those who may have large amounts of waste.  In the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, we have a flat standing charge of &euro;64 per year with Panda and are charged per lift and per kilo.  Will the Minister consider this system?  Since it is a lift charge and a kilo charge, people only present a bin when it is full, making the system more efficient instead of everyone putting out bins that are 80% empty.  The routes are longer and more efficient, with only one bin in every ten being collected.  Most people have discovered that they hardly ever put out their black bins unless, for example, they have young children or medical issues.  By and large, a significant quantity of what we dispose of is recyclable, for example, paper, Tetra Pak and plastic.  Some operators take glass in green bins while others do not.  Either way, there are numerous bottle banks around.  We should also consider this issue.  I was surprised to realise that many local authorities do not use pay by weight.  Pay by weight is a positive step.  I would not recommend standing charge hikes.  The charge should be as low as possible and one should be charged based on what one puts into a bin and how often one presents it.  This would make people change their approach.<\/p> <p>It is important that civic recycling facilities be available, for example, for fluorescent tubes, light bulbs, aerosols, etc.  We have a landfill levy to try to stop people putting material into landfill.  The more that pay by weight is implemented, the better it will be for consumers.  Assuming the standing charge is fair, few people should end up paying more than they do now.  If people have not considered this system, they should talk to people who have used it, for example, those in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, who have been very happy with the outcome.  When we finally privatised our bin collection, 80% of our customers had already left for Panda and Greenstar of their own will because they were offering a cheaper and better service, with bins being put back onto footpaths instead of being left in the middle of the road.  We were left with hardly anyone.  That was 2010 and Panda applied a price freeze for four years.<\/p> <p>I am sure there are rogue operators, but not all bin collectors are rogue, cowboy, fly-by-night operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#TT03800","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il cheerleading privatisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#TT03900","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>It worked in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and I am sure that it can work elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#TT04000","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I have been listening to this conversation.  Changing consumer behaviour has been mentioned.  I am of the view it is positive reinforcement, not attaching charges to recycling, that will change behaviour, for example, a weight related monetary incentive at the end of the year.  Something must be done to incentivise people.  This situation is being handled the wrong way round.  The <i>Journal of Economic Surveys<\/i>has indicated that monetary incentives had a greater impact on household recycling than any other initiative.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That indicates that the monetary incentives had a greater impact on household recycling than any other initiative.  In terms of people's behaviour, when they are charged or taxed for something they view it as something negative, regardless of whether they save money as a result of it later.  They just see it as a charge and then regard recycling as a negative process rather than a positive one that will be a gain for them.<\/p><p>In terms of having two and three bins, in Tallaght it is very difficult.  If we bring in a pay by weight system I believe it will make the problem of illegal dumping worse because when one lives in a housing estate like Killinarden, we all live on top of each other, so to speak.  Our sitting room is in our kitchen so we cannot have three bins to dispose of our waste.  The structures are not in place for us to do it.  If we have a brown bin, a green bin and a black bin outside our doors, and some of us live in very small apartments and flats, and they are robbed, we cannot afford to replace them.  We cannot bring them into the house because they would be on top of us.  We do not have back and front gardens.  Regardless of what system is brought in, the structures are not in place for residents in many estates to recycle, and it is just counter-productive.  We live at the foot of the mountains.  I could bring the Minister on any trail on the Dublin Mountains Way and he will see the huge amount of illegal dumping, which will only get worse.  Most of us have got rid of our green bins, if they have not been robbed or burned at Hallowe'en.  I am saying to the Minister that there are other solutions which would be regarded as positive reinforcement.<\/p><p>When this debate arose years ago I knew a man who lived in extreme poverty in Cushlawn.  At the time the aluminium factory in Tallaght village used to pay for returned cans and he would spend the entire day collecting cans, which he would deposit them and get back the money.  In Germany, when one deposits empty bottles one gets money back.  That type of positive reinforcement for waste management would be much more productive than charging for waste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#TT04200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#UU00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Is l&eacute;ir, ar aon n&oacute;s, gur tharraing an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo neart cainte.

I thank the Library &amp;amp; Research Service for the great work they do for us but even in its explanatory note it has been made quite clear that its reading, which I would take as an independent reading and not a Sinn F&eacute;in reading or that of anybody else, is that the waste management regulations introduce new rules to come into effect from 1 July 2016, namely, an obligation on all householders, with some exceptions, to segregate food waste from other household waste and an obligation on waste collectors to provide separate receptacles such as wheelie bins for food waste and collect them at least once a fortnight on a pay by weight charging system for waste collection-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#UU00300","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I have no problem with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062200002#UU00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1466587800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>-----which I believe backs up what Senator Mac Lochlainn has been saying.<\/p> <p>I want to address some of the issues raised.

They separate their waste, etc., and, once or twice a month or every couple of months, go to a landfill site and bring in a very small bag of waste but from what I can see, everybody else is paying.  The issue is not about people paying.  It is about people being fleeced, which is what would have happened if the system was introduced on 1 July.

It is my understanding that the local authorities and the community wardens have been asked to police the dumping of rubbish.  The question I asked in my contribution was where the extra money the companies wanted to charge would go.  If they are increasing costs and bringing in income of 200% to 300% more than they were previously for a service they have been providing for a number of years - I did not see any of them go out of business locally in Galway - where was that money going to go?  Was it going straight into their bank accounts offshore?  Was any of it coming back to the community?  Why were local authorities being charged to employ staff to go out and police in areas where we are short of community wardens?<\/p> <p>We are told there has been great investment in recycling centres, etc., something to which Deputy Coffey alluded, but in Casla, in south Connemara, we have been campaigning for a recycling centre for well over ten years.  The county council has asked the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government constantly for money to provide that and it has been turned down by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments in previous years.

Fianna F&aacute;il can then bring forward its motion.  We should appoint, as we proposed previously, an independent commission to proof the measures, assess the impacts on carers and other groups such as those on low incomes, those in receipt of State benefits and those who suffer from ill health or disability, and make their findings known.  Let us do it right.  This is putting the cart before the horse.  It is the private agenda ruling the roost again and we have to oppose that.  We have a chance to do it in the Seanad tonight.
