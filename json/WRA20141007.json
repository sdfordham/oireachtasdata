Ireland and our EU partners strongly encourage any such moves in Iran. My Department has also provided the Iranian Foreign Ministry with information on human rights protection and mechanisms in this country. At parliamentary level, I am sure that visits to Iran this year by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and most recently by the Ceann Comhairle will have helped to underline these messages.<\/p><p>  Ireland has repeatedly addressed the human rights situation in Iran in its bilateral contacts and in the relevant international fora.

At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in September, Ireland expressed concerns about the persecution of religious minorities in Iran and our hope that the stated intention of Iran to improve human rights protection will include these minority groups. The upcoming Universal Periodic Review of the human rights record of Iran at the UN in Geneva will be an important opportunity for states to engage in dialogue with Iran on its human rights record and to make recommendations on how to improve it. In addition, later this year, Ireland will once again actively engage in discussions on the annual resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the current 69th session of the UN General Assembly. <\/p><p>  While we welcome positive overtures by the Rouhani administration, we have yet to see significant improvement on the ground in human rights. It may be that the new leadership&rsquo;s focus on trying to resolve the nuclear issue, and avoid negative domestic backlash particularly from conservative quarters, is limiting their ability to act concurrently in this sphere. But human rights is very much an area where positive words must be followed up with actions and changes on the ground, and this is an area we will continue to monitor closely, along with our EU partners.<\/p><p>  I would hope also that if agreement can be reached on the nuclear issue, as seems possible, this may help to act as a confidence building measure for better relations in other areas as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[37739\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide the details of his recent meeting with the US Vice President and the Secretary of State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I recently visited New York, Washington D.C. and Boston over the period from 23 September to 1 October.

Humanitarian relief is also a critical component of the response to mass displacement of civilians fleeing the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. <\/p><p>  UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2178 adopted in recent weeks require all UN Member States to implement comprehensive measures to address the threat of terrorism including through such measures as taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement by terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, including through community outreach initiatives, and denying financial transfers to terrorist groups; and supporting the provision of bilateral assistance to States in developing national capacities to respond to foreign terrorist fighters.

This material will then be collated for future consideration by the ETC. <br\/><br\/>In the meantime, I would like to bring to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention, a number of examples of progress achieved on some of the reconfigured Actions Points:<br\/><br\/><b>Maximise Ireland&rsquo;s access to international markets <\/b><br\/><br\/>Taking account of the new market approach set out in the Review, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this year opened new Embassies and Consulates General in key locations across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas which will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education.  <br\/><br\/><b>Maximise impact of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period worldwide<\/b><br\/><br\/>As part of the &lsquo;Reputation&rsquo; theme of the revised Action Plan model, the 2014 St. Patrick&rsquo;s period saw 30 trade-focussed visits led by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers. As part of these visits, and over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day season, Embassies and Consulates helped to deliver an average of 17 promotional events and engagements each, across 133 cities in 68 countries. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and the Embassy network promoted key messages on trade, tourism and investment in op-eds and interviews in the international media &ndash; reaching, at a very conservative estimate, over 23.5 million people. When overseas media coverage of events that were part of the high level visits or supported by the Embassy network are added, wider audiences of at least 80 million people were reached.<br\/><br\/><b>Maximise the impact of integrated trade missions <\/b><br\/><br\/>In implementing the &lsquo;Winning Business and Jobs&rsquo; theme, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and other State agencies to promote Ireland, Irish companies and Irish products overseas. This is particularly the case in relation to the preparation for and implementation of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade missions, of which 18 will have taken place during 2014. The focus of such trade missions will continue to take account of the identification of seven Exploratory and High Potential Markets under the Review and the expansion of the Embassy network. [If appropriate: I will be leading one of these missions myself to Mexico and Austin in November]<br\/><br\/>The current Strategy runs to the end of 2015 and, of course, the focus of Departments, the Embassy network and the State Agencies will be on its continued implementation over that period. My Department, in consultation with the Embassy network and other Government Departments, State agencies and private sector members of the ETC, would propose to conduct a scoping exercise in the second half of next year to examine options for future approaches in the trade, tourism, investment and education areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Debt Relief","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[37612\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700053#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide Ireland's policies on debt-restructuring for developing countries; his views on global debt justice; and if he discussed this topic with the UN General Secretary recently.","asker":"1005","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>Ireland has played a strong role in international efforts to alleviate the unsustainable debt burden on some of the poorest countries.<\/p><p>  We have been to the forefront of the work globally to build a consensus on the issue of debt cancellation for the least developed countries.

It is crucial now that all sides respect their commitments and work to consolidate and to build upon this ceasefire to secure a sustainable peace.

I hope to see further progress on a sustainable political solution, based on the principle of respect for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on border security, disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces.<\/p><p>   On the key issue of energy supplies, there have been gas talks between Russia and Ukraine. At a meeting in Berlin on 25 September, both sides agreed to consider a compromise proposal put forward by the European Commission aimed at breaking the deadlock to ensure gas supply to Ukraine for the winter. The proposal would see Ukraine settle its debts in two payments, the first of $2 billion in October and the second of $1.1 billion by the end of the year.

The Council stressed its major concerns regarding the human rights and humanitarian situations within Iraq, and outlined EU assistance being made available. The Council welcomed the establishment of a new Government in Iraq which it hopes will take a more inclusive approach and promote the active engagement by all Iraqis, whatever their ethnic or religious background, in the governance of their country.<\/p><p>  On the security situation, the Council welcomed the provision of military support by individual member States to the Iraqi and Kurdish regional authorities, at their request, to combat terrorism, consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2170.<\/p><p>  In relation to resettlement of Iraqi families, it should be recalled that until June of this year, Iraq was itself a location in which refugees fleeing from ISIS in Syria were being accommodated. <\/p><p>  The refugee crisis in and around Syria and Iraq is of enormous proportions, amounting to over 3 million from Syria alone. Resettlement in Europe cannot therefore be the answer to this crisis, as it could only assist a tiny fraction of those in need, while requiring a disproportionate share of the resources available. In addition, it is the normal principle that refugees should as far as possible be accommodated close to their homes, to facilitate eventual return.

More recently, the Minister for Justice and Equality and I have discussed this problem, and agreed that the Minister for Justice and Equality will look at whether we can make an additional number of places available for refugees fleeing the crisis in northern Iraq where minority communities in particular, such as Yazidis and Christians, have been subject to horrendous attacks by ISIS and other extremists. <\/p><p>  These resettlement programmes are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to whom questions as to the precise numbers and origins of persons resettled here should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Israeli Settlements","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[37687\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he will take to discourage economic links with illegal Israeli settlements due to the deteriorating human rights situation for communities on the ground in the West Bank.","asker":"1192","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The European Union applies a sanction to settlement goods in that they are excluded from the lower tariffs applied to goods from Israel (and many other countries), and administrative measures to implement this distinction are periodically reviewed.<\/p><p>  More recently, in 2013, the EU published guidelines to ensure that any EU research funding received by universities or other institutions in Israel, under joint cooperation programmes, could not be spent in the Occupied Territory, that is, in settlements. <\/p><p>  In May of this year, my Department published, in common with many other EU partners, advice to citizens and businesses warning them against investing in, or commercial transactions with, settlements.<\/p><p>  For further measures, I have called at EU level for the speedy issuance of guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods, to assist consumers in distinguishing them from Israeli produce.

I will be meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland later today.<br\/><br\/>The Good Friday Agreement, as well as the values and principles underpinning it, is at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.Implementing outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as the St Andrews Agreement, is a priority for the Government. Among the elements yet to be implemented are the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and an Irish Language Act. The Government&rsquo;s priority remains to ensure that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement function effectively to the benefit of all. I continue to urge all the parties to progress fuller implementation of the Agreements.<br\/><br\/>In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular of the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. <br\/><br\/>The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of an independent Civic Forum representative of civil society in Northern Ireland. The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North\/South Consultative Forum.  In September 2008, the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The Government awaits a response from the Executive.  We have since raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council and it was on the agenda for the plenary meeting of 3 October 2014.<br\/><br\/>A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. Officials of my Department keep in ongoing contact with representatives of civil society on the issue of a Bill of Rights. <br\/><br\/>I will continue to press the importance of implementing outstanding elements of the Agreements in my discussions with the British Government and Northern Ireland Executive.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor these matters in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office and officials of the Northern Ireland Executive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scottish Referendum","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[37611\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700054#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his Department&rsquo;s engagement with and observation of the recent referendum on independence in Scotland; and his position on the current talks to increase devolved powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.","asker":"1190","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>On 18 September, the people of Scotland voted in a referendum to remain a part of the United Kingdom.

It has also undertaken to look at amending the Constitution to include the principle of gender equality, as well as the use of gender-inclusive language in the Constitution.

Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. <\/p><p>  Persons who are unemployed but not in receipt of a social welfare payment are not, however, disqualified from receiving training and employment supports.

Over the same period, 1,579 JA claims from young people were disallowed on the grounds that the applicant&rsquo;s means (from all sources) were deemed to be in excess of the prescribed limits. Disallowances on grounds of means thus represented a maximum of 3% of the claims actually awarded to young people.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.<\/p><p>  A review of the maximum rent limits is being undertaken within the Department. This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies, landlord representative groups and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Any changes to social welfare supports can only be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p><p>  The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014.<\/p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, over 130 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, in the selected local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[38132\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if moneys owed in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry will be waived due to financial circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 19 August 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[38153\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"to set out the measures in place to financially assist undergraduate and postgraduate students with children; the measures she will implement to give assistance to such students where existing payments and assistance are insufficient to allow for continuation in study; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>The Department has a range of training and education schemes available to assist jobseekers in their efforts to return to employment.

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years, and reports now indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol stretching. This involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the exchequer and the motorist.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (IA) of the Finance Act 1999. It carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment. Where conviction occurs on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and that they have been in contact with the motor and oil trades. I understand also that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations\u00a0 that it has been claimed may have been sources of adulterated fuel, and that they will undertake any further enquiries that are required as a result of reports or information that they receive. These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred, and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.<\/p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that, with this cooperation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. It is essential that petrol distributors report any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel.<\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report to Revenue any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions where possible.

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, applies to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.<\/p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).<\/p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State. In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits to scheme members employed outside the State.<\/p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.<\/p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to have a rate of additional levy as low as 0.15% for the years 2014 and 2015. Making an exception for pension funds with a value of less than &euro;300,000 will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.\u00a0 The inevitable result of this course of action would be a narrowing of the levy base which would result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to go down that road.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts to date in 2014 from the Stamp Duty levy on pension fund assets, introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, amount to &euro;697 million. The Deputy may wish to note that this includes an estimate of payments that have not yet been fully processed as a result of increased payment processing times due to the impact of SEPA in 2014. A finalised figure should be available later in the month.<\/p><p>  The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.<\/p><p>  Preparations for Budget 2015 and the consequent Finance Bill are ongoing. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what changes, if any, are being considered in the pension fund levy or any other tax measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[37776\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if excise duty will be reduced in budget 2015 to protect tourism and small and medium enterprises (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>It is not my practice to comment on what measures may or may not be introduced in advance of the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Compensation Fund","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03750"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[37798\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700056#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to detail the balance of the Insurance Compensation Fund.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The Insurance\u00a0Compensation Fund is maintained and administered by the President of the High Court acting through the Accountant of the Courts of\u00a0Justice.

However, they are not annual taxes on an individual's wealth.\u00a0 Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.\u00a0 Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. \u00a0The Domicile Levy introduced in Budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.\u00a0 The combined yield of these taxes considerably exceeds, on an annual basis,\u00a0that of the\u00a0measures considered\u00a0in the Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700057#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":238,"content":"<p>Question No. 164 answered with Question No. 155.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Oil Specifications","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700057#WRE02250"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[37915\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700057#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures that are being put in place to counteract petrol stretching fuel contamination; if his attention has been drawn to the serious financial implications for drivers who unwittingly purchase the product; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a number of reports of problems relating to petrol quality from around the country in recent weeks.\u00a0 In general, such reports are followed up as a matter of course and samples sent to the State Laboratory for analysis where officers have reason to suspect Excise Duty fraud.\u00a0 The recent reports of suspected petrol \"stretching\" are being investigated by the Revenue Commissioners who have been in contact with the Oil and Motor trade in this regard.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Any illegal activity, such as petrol stretching, would be a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.\u00a0 Section 102(1A) of the Finance Act 1999 makes it an offence to sell, deliver or use oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid.\u00a0 In the normal course of work, Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations. These samples are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis.

This is an important measure that supports employment in small breweries throughout the country. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the important role played by the drinks industry in providing employment along\u00a0all points of the production chain, including distilleries, breweries, and public houses. In this regard, the Government has introduced a number of measures to maintain and create jobs in the broader tourism sector, of which the pub trade is an important component. In July 2011, the 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services was introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative. The reduced VAT rate,\u00a0due to expire on 31 December 2013, was retained\u00a0as part of Budget 2014.\u00a0This decision was taken in recognition of the importance of the tourism sector to the overall economy and\u00a0also in recognition of the success of the\u00a0initiative in helping to create many new jobs, as well as protecting existing jobs. The 9% reduced rate applies to the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering, which of course benefits the pub trade. In addition,\u00a0Budget 2014\u00a0provided for the abolition of the\u00a0Air Travel Tax. This measure was designed to increase the number of tourists coming to Ireland,\u00a0thus benefitting the broader\u00a0hospitality sector, including the pub trade.<\/p><p>  These tax policy initatives,\u00a0combined with\u00a0other measures such as investment in tourism infrastructure\u00a0like the\u00a0'Wild Atlantic Way', have begun to bear fruit.\u00a0Figures from the\u00a0Central Statistics Office\u00a0indicate that\u00a0in the period June   August 2014, the total number of\u00a0overseas trips to Ireland\u00a0increased by 9.7% to 2,484,000, an overall increase of 219,200 compared to the same period twelve months earlier.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The\u00a0nationally representative price (as measured by the Central Statistics Office)\u00a0of a\u00a0can\u00a0of lager\u00a0purchased in the off trade\u00a0increased from &euro;1.77 in 2003 to &euro;1.98 in 2014.\u00a0In the same period the excise imposed on such a product\u00a0increased from &euro;0.43 to &euro;0.48. The price of a pint of lager\u00a0purchased\u00a0in the on trade rose from &euro;3.67 in 2003\u00a0to &euro;4.67 in 2014, while the excise imposed on such a product increased from &euro;0.49 to &euro;0.55 in the same period. Accordingly, the excise component as a percentage of the price\u00a0of a pint of lager\u00a0purchased in the on trade is lower now than it was in\u00a02003, while the excise component of a can of lager sold in the off-trade is broadly the same at it was in 2003. This suggests that excise is\u00a0not the primary driver of the price differential.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would\u00a0point out\u00a0that the percentage increase in excise duty in wine\u00a0cited by the Deputy is based on using 2012 as the base year.\u00a0Excise duty on a bottle of wine in 2009 was &euro;2.46, and stands at &euro;3.19 today.\u00a0\u00a0It should\u00a0be noted that the volume of wine cleared for consumption to end July is 9.2% higher than end July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700059#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700059#WRG00650"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[38205\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700059#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the introduction of a tax credit scheme to cover the significant costs of child care in the forthcoming budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>Tax relief is not available\u00a0to parents in respect\u00a0of creche fees or childcare costs.\u00a0However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <br\/><br\/>In addition, a Single Person Child Carer\u00a0tax credit of &euro;1,650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band\u00a0is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b><\/b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b><\/b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br\/><br\/>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.\u00a0 It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. <br\/><br\/>In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.<br\/><br\/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a similar relief existed where a benefit-in-kind exemption was provided for childcare costs where the facilities were provided by the employer. This was abolished in Finance Act 2011. The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employment does not provide such facilities.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs.

I am pleased that the new Report acknowledges the progress that has already been made by the Government and that its recommendations reflect very similar themes and issues to those contained in the 2011 report that I commissioned through Forf&aacute;s. These issues and themes are guiding the work of the South East Development Forum, which I established to drive the renewal of economic and jobs growth in the region. I have asked the South East Forum to consider the contents of the SEEDS Report in the context of its ongoing work.  The report is a very helpful contribution to identifying possible interventions to assist the economy of the South East Region. Some of the actions in the report fall outside my own remit, while others have not been fully costed but are likely to have Exchequer costs if implemented. This naturally creates challenges in the context of the current public expenditure constraints.<br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, the progress which has been made in job creation for the South East Region in recent times has been very heartening, with employment having increased by 15,000 in 2013 alone, a trend which has continued in 2014 .  The unemployment rate has fallen from 19% at the start of 2013 to 14.3% at the end of Q 2 2014.

The SMS has operated in Ireland since 1982 with the objective of promoting and encouraging the consumption of milk among school children. Its management is primarily through the National Dairy Council (NDC) in conjunction with the co-ops, but take-up is quite limited on a geographical level.<br\/><br\/>The Scheme provides for the payment of aid for milk products to school pupils and is co-financed by the EU and the MS, with DAFM the responsible Department in Ireland. The aid rates were reduced by approximately 7% per annum from 2004 to 2007 in line with the general reductions in support prices brought about by the 2003 Mid Term Review of the CAP. However, the Exchequer has made up for this reduction in the EU contribution, and the overall aid rates have been maintained at &euro;27.89\/100kg. Since 2007 the EU contribution is &euro;18.15\/100kg, with the balance of &euro;9.74\/100kg made up by the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>In School year 2012-2013, approximately &euro;677,000 was spent on the scheme for the provision of milk to nursery, preschool, special schools, secondary and primary school pupils. The cost to the EU was &euro;440,572 and the National Top up was &euro;236,428. <br\/><br\/>Each pupil is entitled to 250 ml of milk or milk equivalent per day at an average charge of &euro;0.20 per 250ml. Milk is sold to schools at a subsidised rate and dairies claim the subsidy back from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The cost of the milk on average, as indicated above, is approximately &euro;1- &euro;1.25 per week per child, which equates to approximately &euro;40 per academic year.<br\/><br\/>For the School Year 1st August 2012 to 31st July 2013 almost 2.4 million litres of milk was supplied to schools around the country, the approximate number of children that benefited was 52,937. For the same school year, 1077 schools participated in the Scheme including 95 Montessori, 855 National, 84 Secondary and 43 Special Schools. In total there are 4014 schools registered on the Department of Education website of which 3152 are primary schools.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the size of the carton utilised all NDC member dairies deliver either a 189ml or 250ml carton\/bottle of subsidised milk. Some dairies additionally provide a 330ml carton at the request of schools, (usually secondary). The maximum quantity eligible for aid and upon which a subsidy is provided is for up to 250ml per pupil per day.<br\/><br\/>In respect of issues relating to scheme uptake, unfortunately subscription to the School Milk Scheme is low in secondary schools. This can be attributed to a number of factors such as the perceived administrative burden of running the scheme and the fact that demand for milk will come directly from pupils rather than parents.<br\/><br\/>In terms of efforts to encourage further uptake, the National Dairy Council actively promotes and provides a support service for the subsidised School Milk Scheme through various initiatives.  The NDC contacts every primary school in ROI each September by letter encouraging participation in School Milk and outlines the health and nutritional benefits provided by milk.  The NDC provides a support service to schools that are interested in subscribing to the scheme by putting them in touch with dairies that can deliver to their school.  The NDC supplies fridges free of charge to subscribed schools, thereby ensuring that milk is provided to children at the optimum temperature.  In addition to this the NDC runs dairy education programmes at both primary and secondary level to promote awareness of the benefits of dairy.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the range of products available under the scheme, revisions to and further development of the School Milk Scheme are under negotiation at EU level. In these negotiations Ireland has sought to appropriately extend the range of products that would form the scheme basis. It is noteworthy that a number of milk categories, including skimmed and semi-skimmed milk are currently permitted under the scheme for the school year 2014\/15 but demand has not been evident beyond the whole milk option. As such, full-fat milk is provided by all NDC dairies as that is where demand has been evident from schools and parents. <br\/><br\/>In respect of the application process, this is a straightforward process for interested schools via the NDC.

For this reason, ICCAT has implemented a strict management regime with the objective of bringing about a recovery of the stock. Within the EU, quotas were allocated over ten years ago to Member States based on track record. Ireland, which did not have the track record, does not have a quota. It has access to a by-catch quota for Bluefin tuna in the albacore tuna fishery. However, this by- catch quota is also available to other Member States, and cannot be used for recreational and\/or sport fisheries.<\/p><p>  The Department has, following recent queries, been seeking to clarify the situation regarding recreational fisheries for bluefin tuna with the European Commission. The unequivocal advice I have received from the EU Commission is that a recreational fishery was not legally possible in the absence of a national blue fin tuna quota. We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. Member States vessels with quota share, which was made available based on historic track record in the fishery, are permitted to fish for bluefin tuna.<\/p><p>  ICCAT (the international Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) is responsible for the management and conservation of tuna. Ireland is represented in ICCAT, along with all other EU Member States by the European Commission. Under ICCAT rules bluefin tuna stocks are subject to a recovery plan due the decline in the stock over the years and catches are very strictly monitored and controlled. There would be no support from any quarter for any action by Ireland that might lead to an increase in bluefin mortality.<\/p><p>  My Department is in ongoing discussions with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which has responsibility for angling, and the EU Commission with regard to the possibility of catch and release fishing for bluefin that would not impact mortality and would contribute to scientific knowledge via electronic tagging. However, this is a complicated area both legally and technically and there are many issues that will require examination and clarification before any strong case could be made to the EU Commission, in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700061#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700061#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[37848\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700061#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a single farm payment and disadvantaged area scheme payment will be made in respect of a person (details supplied|) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>Payments under the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme began issuing, on target, on 24 September.

Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language.  <\/p><p>  I might add that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700062#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1018"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700062#WRK02950"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[37681\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700062#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in determination of an application for naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the application has entered the final stage of processing and I intend to grant citizenship.

The Prison Rules were amended in August of this year to clarify the factors which may be taken into account when considering whether or not to grant a prisoner an enhanced rate of remission.

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products. <\/p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.   <\/p><p>  The other matters referred to by the Deputy, i.e. the banning of price-based promotions and the introduction of a statutory code in the area of alcohol merchandising, are a matter for my colleague, Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald who has responsibility for the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008.<\/p><p>  Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008 contains provisions for the making of regulations concerning conditions for the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  The Government has agreed that the forthcoming Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will give Environmental Health Officers statutory enforcement powers in relation to regulations made under Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008.  The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that they will consider how best to proceed with the making of these regulations following enactment of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.<\/p><p>  The Government has agreed to replace the current Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland (RRAI) voluntary code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets with a statutory code of practice under Section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2011.  It is intended that the statutory code will operate for a 2 year period, after which its effectiveness will be jointly evaluated by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that preparatory work on the statutory code of practice is currently under way and it is hoped to launch a consultation process on the contents of the code in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill before the D&aacute;il recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700065#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700065#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[37660\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700065#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns regarding a decision by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland to increase the annual retention fee for 2015; the action that will be taken to address these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  This is to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.<br\/><br\/>In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<br\/><br\/>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,<br\/><br\/>- price(s) previously charged,<br\/><br\/>- local market price, and<br\/><br\/>- budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<br\/><br\/>The cost of long-term nursing home care in public nursing homes is determined by the HSE.  It is acknowledged that there are variations in the cost of care between public, private and voluntary nursing homes and this is due to a range of factors, including nursing and overall staffing ratios, tenure and other conditions of employment, and the overall dependency levels and care needs of residents.<br\/><br\/>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a Review.

In addition, other pressures such as almost 30,000 new cancer diagnoses each year place increasing demands of the order of 3000 &ndash; 6000 additional referral requirements on the system each month. <\/p><p>  Improvements in chronological scheduling, consistent validation of waiting lists and active engagement with patients to reduce &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; or Did Not Attend rates are underway to address outpatient waiting lists; similar measures, as well as optimisation of theatre capacity and day of surgery admission where possible are being employed to improve management of in-patient and day case waiting lists.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the particular patient query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to him directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[37831\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the Health Service Executive general dental anaesthetic service at St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, is closing down with effect from 1 October 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":733,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to investigate this matter and respond to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[37841\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Carlow will receive an appointment for a medical procedure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular patient query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to him directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[37852\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding closure of a day centre in County Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO04200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Births Data","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO04300"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[37859\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700066#WRO04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of stillbirths that are recorded here on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>The numbers of stillbirths as reported by the National Perinatal Reporting System (NPRS) for 2009 to 2013 are given in the table below.

This is to provide that registrants are up-to-date in their professional practice.  <br\/><br\/>In the case of non-Irish professional qualifications, the processes of the general system of Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of  professional qualifications  are applied to the qualifications of both EEA and non-EEA  nationals.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  <\/p><p>  Having examined the possibility of first introducing a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, this was found to be likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement, given the commitment to providing a universal GP service for all.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. <\/p><p>  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  The view was then taken that this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what would have been only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.  The Government having considered this matter, announced, in Budget 2014, it's decision to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by initially providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees. <\/p><p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014.  The Government has decided to prioritise the over 70&rsquo;s in the next phase of the roll-out of universal GP care.  The Government has approved the drafting of a Bill to provide a GP service without fees for all persons aged 70 years and over. Drafting of the Bill has commenced and is the subject on ongoing interaction between the Department and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office and I anticipate the Bill will be published in the near future.  The objective is to have universal GP care without fees for these 2 phases in place in the coming months, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO and the completion of a fee-setting process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700068#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Audiology Services Provision","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700068#WRQ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[38048\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700068#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the regulations governing the prescribing and fitting of hearing aids; if a person is required to be a audiologist and registered with the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiology; in the absence of such qualification the way they are authorised to fit such important devices; and the recourse that persons have who are not satisfied with the service provided","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>The HSE's hearing services for adult medical card holders and children employs audiologists who have received professional training and certification in Audiology.

More detoxification beds have been made available and opportunities to undergo detox in the community have been increased, and there are more places available in rehabilitation programmes generally.

In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.<br\/><br\/>This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984<\/i>;<i><\/i>and<i><\/i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy<\/i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and\/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.  <br\/><br\/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy on 19 September.  I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.  Two of the groups (Patient Focus and Survivors of Symphysiotomy Limited) have welcomed the establishment of an ex-gratia scheme. The third group (Survivors of Symphysiotomy) has advised women to reject the scheme. I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Key aspects of the proposed scheme include:<br\/><br\/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.  If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist.<br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br\/><br\/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br\/><br\/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000)  a medical assessment may be necessary if up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award.<br\/><br\/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br\/><br\/>- The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.  <br\/><br\/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.<br\/><br\/>While I am aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, the Government believes that the establishment of this scheme is a fair and appropriate response. In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02650"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[38245\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason primary school children who qualify for speech and language therapy only get a six week block of services and then it ceases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":882,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Narcolepsy Issues","counter":883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":884,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[38247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700070#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the supports being provided to children who developed narcolepsy following the receipt of the swine flu vaccine, especially considering that many of these children will soon pass the age of 18 and their needs will change including the need for support in higher education and permanent medical cards.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":885,"content":"<p>The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to provide a range of services and supports to individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination regardless of age, on an ex-gratia basis.

Human rights and accountability form one of six priority areas for action.  The aim is to ensure that principles including non-discrimination, equality, empowerment and participation are integrated across all our development efforts.  In this way, we aim to contribute to the fulfilment of our international human rights commitments, including in the area of disability.<br\/><br\/>The recently released Framework for Action for <i>One World, One Future <\/i>aims to ensure effectiveness and accountability in achieving these policy commitments. To better address the rights of those with disabilities, the Framework identifies the need for the Government&rsquo;s overseas development programme &ndash; Irish Aid &ndash; to address the needs of the most vulnerable and consistently address inequalities in policy and programming.  It also identifies the need for a sustained focus on access to services, with a sharpened focus on reaching the most marginalised.<br\/><br\/>Through the Irish Aid programme there has and will continue to be a strong focus on addressing the needs of vulnerable groups.  We have provided support to a wide range of Irish-based NGOs, including Plan, Sightsavers, Christian Blind Mission, Children in Crossfire, to undertake work that specifically benefits people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Throughout our Partner Country programming there is also a strong focus on disability.  In Mozambique, Irish Aid is supporting NGOs to implement a project entitled &ldquo;Living without Limits&rdquo;.  In Vietnam, disability is one of the focus areas for Irish Aid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Civil Society Facility&rsquo;.  Under our Partnership Programme with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), a priority area of focus is on assisting people with disabilities and advocating on disability legislation in Africa.  Irish Aid support has facilitated access for women entrepreneurs with disabilities into mainstream women&rsquo;s entrepreneurship activities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<br\/><br\/>At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland called for an ambitious Post 2015 framework that can drive efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, reflecting the rights and priorities of the almost 1 billion people currently living with disabilities.  Ireland has successfully advocated for better and more disaggregated data, including for disability, to ensure that the Post 2015 agenda 'leaves no one behind'.  Such data can facilitate a clearer understanding of the relationship between disability and poverty and the barriers that disabled people face in fully participating in economic life.<br\/><br\/>These represent just some examples of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities.  Through the implementation of <i>One World, One Future <\/i>and the associated Framework, the Irish Aid programme will continue to be strongly focused on supporting policies and programmes that eliminate exclusion, thus ensuring that the most vulnerable have access to essential services and opportunities throughout the developing world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700072#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":978,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700072#WRU01850"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[37858\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700072#WRU01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the pro-democracy protests taking place in Hong Kong; his views on whether Hong Kong's democratic structures are now under threat; and his discussions at EU level regarding these development.","asker":"1037","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":980,"content":"<p>My Department is monitoring the situation in Hong Kong closely and is in regular contact with our Consulate General in Hong Kong and with our Embassy in Beijing.<br\/><br\/>Ireland supports Hong Kong&rsquo;s Basic Law protections of internationally recognised fundamental freedoms, including freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.

The latest report on the implementation of Resolution 2139 sets out very clearly that the fundamental obstacles to the provision of humanitarian assistance remain in place across Syria, and that the parties to the conflict remain in breach of international law. These resolutions make absolutely clear the obligations and duties on all parties, especially the Assad regime, to uphold humanitarian principles and international law. Full compliance without any further delay by all parties is the only acceptable response to their adoption. <\/p><p>  The growth of extremism and the threat posed by ISIS and other jihadist groups to the people of Syria and Iraq was extensively discussed at the UN General Assembly which I attended last week.

Enlargement is a conditional process: prospective member states must achieve progress on reforms in order to move forward on their EU paths. <br\/><br\/>The European Commission actively supports the reform process by preparing annual country progress reports, which outline the extent to which the candidate and potential candidate countries have advanced to reach the necessary standard to join the EU.

The promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas is vital to the recovery and development of the domestic economy. The Department is committed to using its full resources, at headquarters and through the Embassy network, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests, cultural profile and reputation internationally. The work of the Embassy network is essential to efforts to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and to drive economic recovery through the promotion of trade, tourism and investment.  The Embassy network is uniquely placed to influence key decision-makers and opinion formers around the world.  In the wake of the economic and financial crisis, the Embassy network has played a particularly important role in repairing and enhancing our reputation and promoting economic recovery.  In addition, our Embassies in the EU have played a key role in mitigating the impact of the crisis, through sustained engagement with EU institutions and member states, supporting the restructuring of the promissory note, the clean exit from the EU\/IMF programme and the recent agreement on early repayment of IMF loans.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Embassy network supported a total of 136 high-level visits with a significant economic or promotional dimension across 52 countries. The Embassy network also undertook more than 730 engagements to facilitate trade and investment supporting jobs in Ireland, as well as more than 660 specific engagements to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic position to office-holders worldwide. Ambassadors and Embassy staff engaged with over 1,150 representatives of the international media to promote Ireland&rsquo;s profile and global reputation, and key messages on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and its strengths as a location for foreign investment were promoted in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 53 million people. Speeches and public presentations by Embassy staff promoted Ireland&rsquo;s interests directly to audiences of over 778,000 around the world.<\/p><p>  The Embassy network has continued this work throughout 2014. In particular, the unique promotional opportunity presented by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been used to full effect to advance Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests. This year, our Embassies and Consulates, 60 percent of which are staffed by just one or two diplomats, helped to deliver an average of 17 promotional events and engagements each during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, across 133 cities in 68 countries, and supported 30 trade-focused high-level visits. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and the Embassy network promoted key messages on trade, tourism and investment in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 23.5 million people. When overseas media coverage of events that were part of the high-level visits or supported by the Embassy network is added, wider audiences of at least 80 million people were reached.<\/p><p>  Our Embassy network plays an important role in the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. In priority markets, our Ambassadors chair Local Market Teams, which consist of representatives of the Embassy and State agencies that are present in the market and are responsible for the development of annual Local Market Plans. The implementation of these plans is reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which works to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment.<\/p><p>  Recognising the important contribution that our Embassies and Consulates make to the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas, the Government decided in January of this year to open eight new diplomatic Missions &ndash; five new Embassies and three Consulates-General. These new Missions include newly-established Embassies in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), along with the reopening of the Embassy to the Holy See, and Consulates in Hong Kong (China), S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazil) and Austin (Texas, US). The opening of these new Missions will expand the global reach of our economic diplomacy efforts and strengthen our capacity to advance key national interests in trade, tourism and investment promotion, as well as building our broader diplomatic relationship with the countries concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukrainian Conflict","counter":1028,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[38231\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the European Union continues to monitor the situation in the Ukraine with particular reference to the need to ensure the protection of democracy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>The situation in Ukraine remains a major priority for the EU and we continue to closely monitor developments there.

Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme has always had a strong poverty focus and the new development policy &ldquo;One World One Future&rdquo; will strengthen that focus and adjust it to the changing context in developing countries. Our aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the most effective in reaching the poorest.<\/p><p>  Ireland directs the greater part of its assistance to some of the neediest countries in the world.  Approximately 80% of our bilateral assistance goes to Least Developed and Low Income countries and to Africa. Programmes funded with this aid are designed and monitored to ensure that our support reaches the intended beneficiaries.  They are appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability and cost effectiveness. The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit. Qualified Irish and local staff manage in-country aid programmes and ensure that both financial and results reporting by partners is satisfactory. Having a presence on the ground in our partner countries ensures that the management of partners and the dialogue with partner governments are effective.  Programme monitoring visits are carried out regularly to assess that funds are appropriately used and programme objectives met.<\/p><p>  Robust accountability systems in Partner Countries are essential to ensuring that development assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries.  Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of these systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance.  Our own management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.<\/p><p>  We will continue to encourage and work with all our partner governments, NGOs, multilateral organisations and others to ensure that they adhere to the high standards of accountability and transparency promoted by the Irish Government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[38235\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700073#WRV03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the top ten locations worldwide wherein serious human rights abuses continue; the extent to which efforts are ongoing by the international community in terms of a positive influence at such locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>Neither Ireland nor, as far as I am aware, the European Union or the United Nations maintains a list of locations in regard to the greatest human rights violations as requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.<\/p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.<\/p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.<\/p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.

They include the ability to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the role of teachers as educational leaders who contribute to creating and sustaining learning communities in their classrooms and in their schools, strategies for developing positive relationships and to communicate effectively with colleagues and to use appropriate class management and organisational skills to cater for a range of classroom situations. <br\/><br\/>  In addition my Department funds the national induction programme for teachers (NIPT) which provides an interactive workshop that focusses on the classroom environment and planning to support inclusion.

As such it is the Council, not the Minister, that sets out the programme criteria.  Changes to the structure and content of the Gaeltacht Placement arose from the Teaching Council's new accreditation criteria, published in June 2011 (Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers) which provide, inter alia, for &quot;an extended and reconceptualised Gaeltacht residency which will now form part of the overall programme and be under the direct jurisdiction of the teacher education providers.&quot; <br\/><br\/>  The Teaching Council established a Gaeltacht Placement Working Group and published a report in May 2012 which, among other things, provides for the placement duration to be extended to take place in two blocks of two weeks and a common course content across all initial teacher education providers.  Initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes.  My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education.<br\/><br\/>  A decision was made to abolish payments by my Department towards the cost of attendance at Gaeltacht courses by initial teacher education students with effect from September 2012.

In the majority of home tuition cases there will be one child in receipt of an individualised educational programme on a 1:1 basis.<\/p><p>  A focus of my Department in the implementation of the scheme has been to ensure that the services which the Department pays for are delivered in line with the sanction provided.  My Department has no preference, from an educational perspective, in the delivery of the scheme for 1:1 provision. 1: 1 provision is not an educational feature of the scheme but is an effective consequence for these children, other than in the case of siblings, who are tutored in their homes.<\/p><p>  My Department has a responsibility to ensure that the funding for the scheme is managed and monitored appropriately.  To ensure that the funding is used fully for its intended purpose the Department specified in 2013, and subsequently, to parents of children, for whom the tuition is being provided in the home, that tuition must be  1: 1, again with the exception of siblings. This is to avoid the possibility that group arrangements would be arranged without the knowledge and authorisation of the Department.<\/p><p>  This is not a requirement of parents which have been approved for the group arrangements.<\/p><p>  Where parents of children who are eligible for home tuition have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition my Department has responded and facilitated by putting arrangements in place with private commercial organisations which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting. Payment in these cases is made directly to the service provider and is calculated on a group rate basis.  My Department has no contract with these providers and therefore the question of procurement or tendering does not arise.<\/p><p>  The arrangements facilitate the transfer of home tuition payments, normally paid directly to the parents, to the provider and a reduction of the rates paid in recognition of the fact that the service is less expensive than normal, as the children are tutored together. The agreed group rate is not directly comparable to the cost of school based provision which includes teacher and SNA salaries, capitation and the various other supports provided by my Department, many of which, including capitation, are not available to the private providers referred to by the Deputy. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware home tuition is not an alternative to school and is provided in very limited and specific circumstances.  For children with a special educational need seeking an educational placement, tuition will be approved as an interim measure, until a school placement has been identified.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will assist parents experiencing difficulties in this regard. The arrangements in place with private providers are clear that where school placements are found for participating children the providers will support the child's integration into the school setting.  It is for this reason that the arrangement with the initial private provider was intended to be for one year only pending the roll out by the NCSE of school based provision.  However the arrangement has continued due to further requests from subsequent parents of children on home tuition to use such facilities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has queried further to Parliamentary Question No. 223 of 30 April 2013, the reason the exception referred to in that reply was made by my Department for just one private commercial organisation involving the education of children with autism. At that time the organisation concerned was the only one with whom my officials had concluded an agreement.  Also at that point in time my officials were aware of other groups of parents of children on home tuition seeking similar arrangements.  Therefore there are now similar arrangements in place with other private commercial organisations which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1131,"content":"<p>Question No. 476 answered with Question No. 466.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Higher Education Institutions","counter":1132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1133,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[37942\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that many students with disabilities access university and third level colleges via FETAC courses; if her further attention has been drawn to the fact that they must achieve a high standard in their FETAC course in order to do this; if her further attention has been drawn to the fact that they may not access university using DARE having secured FETAC qualifications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1134,"content":"<p>As higher education institutions, including universities and institutes of technology, are autonomous bodies under the relevant legislation, the management of their academic affairs, including admissions criteria, are matters for the individual institutions concerned.

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.<br\/><br\/>Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br\/><br\/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br\/><br\/>In considering how a social context profile might be developed for schools, the working group noted that the Department currently holds information which underpinned the development of the Developing Equality in Schools (DEIS) schools programme. However, this information dates from 2005, and was not considered by the Working Group to be current enough to provide a social context component for any new SEN Resource Teacher\/Learning support allocation model.<br\/><br\/>The group therefore recommended that a new social context schools survey should be conducted.Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives.<br\/><br\/>The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br\/><br\/>It was considered that the issuing of a new survey was a preferable option to using existing data from 2005, or data from limited sources that may not capture the full current complexity of a schools school's make up.<br\/><br\/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.<br\/><br\/>At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.<br\/><br\/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br\/><br\/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br\/><br\/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Data","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[38064\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700075#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a breakdown of the amount of surveys-questionnaires, that require personal and sensitive information on pupils and their families, that schools are currently required to carried out; the purpose of gathering such sensitive material; the person that will have access to the material; and if a school declines to carry out these surveys-questionnaires the impact it will have on the school.","asker":"1037","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department, in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre, recently requested schools to complete a social context survey, to assist the development of an educational profile for schools which might support a proposed new model for allocating resource teachers to schools.<\/p><p>  Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.<\/p><p>  The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. <\/p><p>  Schools were not asked to return personal or sensitive data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils or their families.<\/p><p>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire.

There is no impact on schools at present if the information on Ethnic or Cultural Background is not returned, however, as POD has been developed to replace a number of data collections including the National School Annual Census, for the 2016\/2017 academic year onwards, if pupils who are Members of the Traveller Community are not identified in POD the school will not be able to receive the enhanced capitation for travellers.<\/p><p>  Finally, I can advise that my Department also collects details of post-primary students enrolled as at 30th September each year.

Schools have autonomy in relation to the deployment of classroom teachers to individual classes. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.<\/p><p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. <\/p><p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. <\/p><p>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level was extended for the current school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.

The purpose of this period was to enable those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) which were ready to apply, and which had expressed a strong interest in gaining recognition for 2014, to do so through a revised and strengthened process.<\/p><p>  Providers were required to attend a briefing before making an application, and three such briefings took place during that period. I am informed by QQI that the briefings were held on 30 October 2013, 28 November 2013 and 9 January 2014 and that a total of 53 providers were represented.<\/p><p>  By 31 January, QQI\/ACELS had received a total of 35 applications for recognition. As of 25 September, 5 of those applications had been successful, 1 application had been refused and 10 applications ceased due to closure, suspension or a change of circumstances post-application. The remaining 19 applications are still in process, with 14 of those applications being close to completion.<\/p><p>  With regard to the International Education Mark, QQI published its White Paper on the International Education Mark in May and published a draft Code of Practice, developed in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, last week. The final Policy on the International Education Mark and the Code of Practice will be published by QQI before the end of the year. QQI will begin to accept applications for authorisation to use the International Education Mark from English Language Training Organisations at the beginning of 2015 and higher education providers will then be able to apply in the second half of the year. Details of the application process will be made available when it is opened to providers.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012, sets out the legislative framework for the International Education Mark. The Act provides that the Mark will be authorised at provider level, rather than at programme level, and requires that providers will have to &ndash; <\/p><p>(1) agree quality assurance and access, transfer and progression procedures with QQI before applying for authorisation,<\/p><p>(2) ensure that their programmes lead to awards which are recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications (where they are capable of being so recognised), and<\/p><p> (3) demonstrate their overall compliance with the Code of Practice for the provision of education to international learners. <\/p><p>  Therefore, if the awards referred to by the Deputy are recognised through the Framework they would not prevent the provider concerned from gaining authorisation to use the International Education Mark.<\/p><p>  It should be noted, however, that authorisation to use the International Education Mark will not, on its own, allow providers to recruit non-EEA students from 1 January 2015. The regulatory reform of the international education, which I recently announced with the Minister for Justice and Equality, requires that the programmes concerned lead to awards made by Irish awarding bodies, such as the universities or QQI. Therefore providers will not be permitted to recruit non-EEA students to programmes leading to the awards referred to by the Deputy. <\/p><p>  From 1 January, eligible programmes will be listed on an Interim List of Eligible Programmes for Student Immigration Permission, and the detailed criteria for inclusion of programmes on that list can be found on www.intregister.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700076#WRY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Administration","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700077#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[38151\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700077#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the guidelines under article 15(8) of the student grant scheme 2014 that allow an awarding authority discretion to waive the provisions of articles 15(6) and 15(7); when he issued those guidelines to the awarding authorities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1218,"content":"<p>The Guidelines for an Awarding Authority, which includes the guidelines under article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2014, referred to by the Deputy, issued in hard copy to the awarding authorities on 28th May and in electronic format on 29th May.<br\/><br\/>The guidelines document issued in conjunction with the 2014 Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2014\/15 academic year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700077#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Support Schemes","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700077#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[38154\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100700077#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students who have left undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014 due to financial reasons; the measures she has in place to assist students with children keeping their places in university; the steps she will take to improve retention of students with children in undergraduate and postgraduate study; the financial assistance she will make available for such students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>The information in relation to students who have left college due to financial reasons is not available in the format requested.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place o f residence. The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pa y the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.<br\/><br\/>Part 12 of t he Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.<br\/><br\/>A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.<br\/><br\/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at, encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases . It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and that it shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <br\/><br\/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data are only used for the purpose collected and must also ensure that any data collected are stored securely.  The collection of PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings.<br\/><br\/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Throughout the last number of weeks , Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.  The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. <br\/><br\/>Last week the CER made a determination on the water charges plan, submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details.  In these circumstances, a default charge which does not include the free allowances will be applied to such customers.  The relevant details of the determination are available on the CER website (). <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, . It has confirmed that this notice was, and is, fully compliant with data protection requirements. However, by providing additional clarity, it will re-assure customers that data are held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where necessary for the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks.  Any advice given to Irish Water from the Data Protection Commissioner will be further incorporated into its data protection notice.<br\/><br\/>Customers wishing to avail of the direct debit payment facility can do so by providing Irish Water with bank details on the application form.  This is optional for customers and in its customer handbook Irish Water has outlined several other methods of payment that will be available to its customers. <br\/><br\/>Management companies of student accommodation and businesses such as summer colleges are already categorised as non-domestic customers for water services.

The amount billed to domestic customers for the year 2015 based on the charging structure announced will be in the order of &euro;300 million.

The Market Corporation Test is a requirement that income from customers be greater than 50% of production costs. <\/p><p>  If this test is not met, then Irish Water&rsquo;s borrowings would be considered as part of the General Government Debt.

Developments in the broadband market over recent years means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of rural Ireland, including the area previously covered by the National Broadband Scheme. Details of commercial services available in each county can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual operators.<\/p><p>   The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Following a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS. The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate. EU State Aid approval was granted for a scheme of limited duration. As a consequence, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.<\/p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis offering consumers the same choice of Broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they have also informed my Department of their plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS Coverage Areas within the next three years.<\/p><p>  The correspondence refers to customers previously served by the NBS satellite service, which was utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises. Digiweb, who provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, continue to offer broadband services on a commercial basis to these customers. My officials understand that Digiweb have recently contacted customers regarding an increase in tariff to rates similar to those charged by Digiweb outside of NBS areas. For this increase the majority of customers will receive increased download and upload speeds and a 37% increase in data allowance. A very limited number of customers affected by this tariff increase cannot receive the upgrade in speeds and data allowance as the technology deployed does not allow for an upgrade to their service. Digiweb have advised my officials that they are investigating a plan to transfer these customers to the newer technology.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas. Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list of areas has already been identified and includes 59 areas in County Kerry. I am also aware of extensive rollout of high speed broadband services in County Kerry by at least one commercial operator.<\/p><p>  As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September. 31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year.

During the tender process for the project, the consultants retained by the Department evaluated a range of options for the postcode structure, including the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. After detailed consideration an approach using a unique identifier was recommended to Government by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The postcode design and brand &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; was approved by Government in April this year.<br\/><br\/>There has been widespread support from both public sector bodies and private businesses with particular interest from the retail and financial industries for the introduction of postcodes nationally.

These have included the introduction and progress of the third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster parliament, the formation of Volunteer movements, and the outbreak of World War I.  Economic and social issues were examined in 2013 on the Centenary of the 1913 Lockout along with the role of suffragettes.  This year has seen significant attention to the mobilisation in Ireland and across Europe for the First World War.
