Our 6 National Parks account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. <\/p><p>Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country. <\/p><p>However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. <\/p><p>In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.<\/p><p>In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership last year with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination. F&aacute;ilte Ireland invested capital funding of &euro;550,000 to kick-start the initiative.  This initial funding focussed on the five National Parks and five Nature Reserves situated on the Wild Atlantic Way in addition to Wicklow Mountains National Park. The funding facilitated the undertaking of feasibility, scoping and design of tourism and recreational projects, building on the strengths of each location, as well as further promoting track and trails within our National Parks and Nature Reserves for walkers and tourists.<\/p><p>One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte is &ldquo;<i>Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland<\/i>&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, and it is currently being finalised. This will prioritise and deliver significant investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage. The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities. <\/p><p>I recently launched &ldquo;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage&rdquo;, a ten year plan setting out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage. A major investment programme in our National Parks is envisaged under this Plan with significant investment in visitor facilities and a strong emphasis on conservation and protection of biodiversity. Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage will support significant investment in recreational facilities including trails networks. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all. <\/p><p>Over the period of the plan, the following projects are planned: <\/p><p>- Improvement of visitor facilities at Connemara and Glenveagh National Parks;<\/p><p>- New walking and cycling trails at Ballycroy National Park;<\/p><p>- Investment in outdoor recreational facilities in Killarney National Park;<\/p><p>- Investment in interpretation at our Nature Reserves; and<\/p><p>- Enhancement of the visitor experience at Wicklow National Park.<\/p><p>- Strategic park enhancements<\/p><p>So while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development Funding","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[19918\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide additional information on the provisions contained in the Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 plan for a regional production fund aimed at assisting with the cost of filming outside counties Dublin and Wicklow.","asker":"1328","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s capital investment plan <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018- 2027 <\/i>provides for funding of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and audio visual industries through the Irish Film Board over the next 10 years which will have a positive impact right across the country. <\/p><p>This will assist in realising the vision under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland Programme to develop Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production.<\/p><p>Related to this my Department will soon publish the report on the &ldquo;Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;  and related Government Plan for the Audiovisual industry which will set out in greater detail how it is proposed to develop the industry further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hare Coursing Data","counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[19896\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900060#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of hares dying at coursing clubs by club in 2017 and to date in 2018; if post mortems have been carried out in all cases; the number which had pre-existing conditions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>Figures available to my Department from the Irish Coursing Club indicate that during the 2016\/17 and 2017\/18 hare coursing seasons the number of hares that died at coursing meetings was 26 and 24 respectively.

The Bill has three main Parts, amending the Canals Act 1986, the Wildlife Acts and the Heritage Act 1995.<\/p><p>The principal purpose of the Bill is to implement the Report of the Critical Review of the Heritage Council approved by Government in 2013. <\/p><p>The Bill also amends the Canals Act 1986 to allow the making of bye-laws by Waterways Ireland for the regulation of boating and management of the canals. <\/p><p>The Bill also<i><\/i>provides for controlled burning of vegetation under strict regulation in the month of March on a pilot basis for a two year period, and for the managed cutting of roadside hedges, under strict regulation, in August, again for a two year pilot period. The Bill also clarifies the powers of authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts and harmonises the provisions of the Roads Act 1993 with the Wildlife Acts.<\/p><p><b>Burning of vegetation in the month of March <\/b><\/p><p>The provision in the Heritage Bill is not a blanket approval allowing the indiscriminate burning of vegetation in March.  The legislation provides for Regulations (on a two-year pilot basis) to allow burning in certain areas of the country, at specified periods in the month of March, for example where burning has been impossible earlier in the year due to adverse weather.<\/p><p><b>Cutting of hedges in August<\/b><\/p><p>The Regulations will require that any cutting of roadside hedges in August may only be of the current year's growth. Heavier cutting must still be done during the existing permitted period, i.e. between September and the end of February. There will be a public consultation process including consultation with relevant stakeholders in finalising these Regulations which are for a two-year pilot period.<\/p><p><b>Harmonising the Wildlife Act with the safety provisions in the Roads Act <\/b><\/p><p>Section 70(2) of the Roads Act obliges landowners to ensure that vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.  A local authority may serve notices on landowners to deal with vegetation, for safety purposes, along public roads.  However, the Wildlife Acts state that such works may not be undertaken by landowners.<\/p><p>The conflict between these two pieces of legislation needs to be resolved and so the provision in the Heritage Bill is designed to harmonise both sets of legislation, clear up any confusion and remove conflict. <\/p><p><b>Regulation of boating on the Canals<\/b><\/p><p>The amendments to the Canals Act will allow Waterways Ireland to make bye&ndash;laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals and will enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage these waterways for the benefit of all their users.<\/p><p>Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  There are over 500 boats on the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation and Waterways Ireland is seeking to encourage more visiting boats onto the waterways.  The existing bye law regime is not conducive to advancing this objective.  The proposed bye-laws are intended to encourage tourism and leisure craft users by supporting the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals and by enhancing Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, care for and maintain the canals and to help to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users. <\/p><p><b>The Heritage Council<\/b><\/p><p>In implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Critical Review of the Heritage Council approved by Government in 2013, this Bill will refocus the activities and functions of the Heritage Council, with a particular emphasis on engagement with communities and local authorities. The Bill also introduces the non-remuneration of Board members while continuing their entitlement to expenses incurred in discharge of their duties, reduces the size of the Board and removes the requirement for statutory Standing Committees on wildlife, archaeology, architectural heritage and inland waterways.

Over the last number of years, Irish talent has been a consistent presence at the Academy Awards, with Nora Twomey&rsquo;s debut animated feature, The Breadwinner, leading the Irish charge at this year's ceremony alongside other nominations for Irish talent including Saoirse Ronan, Consolata Boyle, Martin McDonagh and Daniel Day-Lewis. The industry&rsquo;s current flourishing is the result of the Irish Film Board&rsquo;s years of investment in Irish creative filmmaking talent, made possible through consistent Government backing as well as Section 481, which plays a crucial role in attracting inward production to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  In partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my Department commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries.  The Report by consultants Olsberg SPI with Nordicity found that the Irish audiovisual industry, comprising Film, TV and animation; commercial advertising; and video games, supported 14,370 full-time equivalents jobs in 2016; with Gross Value Added amounting to &euro;857 million and an estimated &euro;191 million in export earnings for Ireland.  The industry also provided valuable cultural exports reaching substantial global audiences and bringing benefits to other industries such as the tourism sector.  <\/p>  <p>  This Report will provide an input for the development of an industry-wide long term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland Programme.  The Plan will set out an agenda to further develop the Irish Audiovisual Industry and in that context my Department will work with the Film Board and all sectors of the industry to address any barriers to continued success.

The concessionary post is only retained until such time as one of the existing cohort of teachers leaves the newly amalgamated school and, as such, is not a permanent allocation but is a temporary measure to assist in the amalgamation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900066#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900066#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[20277\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900066#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools in County Louth which have prefabs on site.","asker":"1330","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[20278\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900066#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools in County Louth which have more than one prefab.","asker":"1330","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[20279\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900066#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the location of schools in County Louth which utilise prefabs on their site.","asker":"1330","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 to 114, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department does not hold details relating to the information requested.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is my intention to replace all purchased temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation, where the need is established, over the lifetime of my Department's Capital Programme (2016 to 2021).

The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900069#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900069#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[20448\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900069#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the capital allocation across his Department in each of the years 2018 to 2022.","asker":"1280","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[20465\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900069#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his Department's capital allocation for projects under way and projects already tendered or committed to spending contractually.","asker":"1280","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[20482\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900069#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his Department's capital allocation in each of the years 2018 to 2022 disaggregated according to capital allocated to projects under way, projects contractually committed to and projects yet to be initiated.","asker":"1280","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 to 134, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s capital allocation for the years 2018 to 2022 is as follows:<\/p><p>2018 - &euro;745m<\/p><p>2019 - &euro;941m<\/p><p>2020 - &euro;942m<\/p><p>2021 - &euro;1,006m<\/p><p>2022 - &euro;1,100m<\/p><p>The capital funding available to my Department for the years 2018 to 2021 has been allocated across the various sectors as set out in the table.<\/p><p>The National Development Plan signalled a capital allocation of &euro;1.1 billion for the Department of Education and Skills in 2022.

The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase &ndash; up from\u00a02,270 in 2010 to 3,661 as\u00a0of 1st May 2018 and there are now 2,491 GPs contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme compared to 2,098 in 2008.  It should be noted that as of 1st March there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has also taken steps to expand GP training.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and this year we expect to fill\u00a0194\u00a0places, an increase of over 60% in this nine year period.  The Programme for Government commits to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the\u00a0current GMS contract.  Our goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion, disease prevention and for the structured care of chronic conditions.  This will enable general practitioners to better meet the needs of patients and will also promote general practice as a viable and rewarding career for both existing doctors and future medical graduates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[20327\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients per general practitioner in each CHO area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>As this question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[20328\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900075#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the stage at which his Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are in relation to providing a new supported model of housing for elderly persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>Both the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are working together in finalising a high-level policy statement that will provide a framework by which Government can facilitate and promote a variety of housing options, including supported housing (i.e. housing with care), for older people. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this the Department and the HSE are participating in a demonstrator project in partnership with Department of Housing, Dublin City Council, the HSE and the Irish Council for Social Housing.

This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.<\/p><p>Minister of State Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that\u00a0will\u00a0lead to improvements for\u00a0consumers across Ireland.<\/p><p>In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:<\/p><p>- My\u00a0Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.<\/p><p>- Both Departments also\u00a0worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing and has been\u00a0included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.  It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.<\/p><p>- Under Action 40\u00a0of\u00a0the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.  This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives, in providing guidance with respect to\u00a0specific categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.<\/p><p>- ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem\u00a0with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness,\u00a0allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.<\/p><p>In terms of tackling broadband deficiencies, the Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0 The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today\u00a0almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government has come into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State-led intervention.\u00a0 The procurement process is now in the final stages.<\/p><p>Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.  I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie\u00a0and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from\u00a0service providers to make contact with the Regulator.<\/p><p>A\u00a0national\u00a0list of Broadband Officers can be found at the below link.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900081#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900081#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[20312\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900081#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the contracts awarded by his Department or an agency under his remit to a company (details supplied) since March 2011, by year, in tabular form; the cost per contract; the basis for each contract; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>The company referred to in the Question was awarded a 10-year contract in December 2013 to develop, implement, maintain and promote the use of the National Postcode System \"Eircode\".

My Department would not be a party to the SEO process, however, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.

This review is examining the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare, including a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion- the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years.

The MWP report itself was published in April 2017 following a commitment in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy 2015 -2024 and was undertaken in order to better identify how people with disabilities could be supported to achieve their employment ambitions.  <\/p>  <p>  The consultation reflects a commitment made at the time of the publication of the MWP report to consult widely with persons with disabilities and their families in relation to the number of recommendations about the principle of early engagement and a proposed reconfiguration of the Disability Allowance (DA) payment.  One MWP recommendation is to support young adults through education, training and social inclusion according to their capacity, and to change the lowest qualifying age for DA from 16 to 18 years.  The other recommendation was to adopt an early engagement approach in order to support the employment ambitions of people with disabilities.  Early engagement would mean that the State will support people with disabilities at the earliest stage possible to help them achieve their employment goals.  To this end, people with disabilities would begin receiving assistance, advice and support from the departments Intreo service or other related services when they apply for a disability income support payment.  <\/p>  <p>  At the launch of the consultation process, I together with the Minister of State for Disabilities made clear that engagement would be voluntary: in other words, it would be a matter for persons with disabilities themselves to decide whether they wanted to avail of the supports offered through the Intreo service.  This has been stressed at all stages throughout the consultation process.  <\/p>  <p>  The national consultation process concluded on April 13th and now will be followed by further consideration of the results with a stakeholder focus group.  This group is comprised of persons with experience of disability issues and was established last September and has helped my Department with the design of the national consultation process.  <\/p>  <p>  I together with my Government colleagues, look forward to learning the outcome of the consultation process in due course.  The Government will then consider what actions will best support the overall objective of improving employment outcomes for persons with a disability.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900085#WRAA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Partial Capacity Benefit Scheme Administration","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900085#WRAA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[20301\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900085#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the average processing times for applications for partial capacity benefit; her views on whether the time it is taking to process such applications is discouraging persons from returning to work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>The partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows people with restricted capacity to avail of employment opportunities while still in receipt of an income support.

HAP recipients are required to set up\u00a0automatic electronic rent payment arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. Accordingly, the day-to-day operation of the social housing system, including HAP, is a matter for the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with regard to differential rent, section 58(3) of the Housing Act 1966 provides that, subject to such Regulations, as may be made by the Minister under the section, a housing authority may charge such rent or other payment, as they may determine from time to time, in respect of a dwelling of which they are the owner. The making and amending of rent schemes and the administration of such schemes is accordingly the responsibility of housing authorities, as an integral part of their housing management functions. <\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on local authorities to ensure that the administration of rents and associated matters are undertaken within the framework of an effective system for the proper management and maintenance of the housing stock.\u00a0 Rental income is the main source of funding for the management and maintenance of dwellings.\u00a0Rent schemes developed should ensure that the overall rental income reflects adequately, insofar as it is practicable to do so, the cost of management and maintenance of the local authority's rented housing stock and enables the authority to fulfil its obligations to its tenants in regard to the management and maintenance of their dwellings. Broad principles in relation to this matter were laid down by my Department via Circular letter and associated guidelines, which drew on an extensive process of consultation with local authority practitioners, were also issued which should be of assistance in\u00a0 achieving good practice in the administration of rent related matters.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme.\u00a0The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Outside of issuing the formal notification letters, there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process. Depending on the activity of arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and\/ or cessation\u00a0of the HAP payment. However, in the\u00a0vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise\u00a0the landlord. <\/p>  <p>  If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing,\u00a0both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased. <\/p>  <p>  To date, the approach has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2017, when nearly 18,000 additional households were supported by HAP, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900086#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Data","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900087#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[20210\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900087#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of judicial reviews undertaken in the context of Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 in the past five years to date; the outcomes of same; if he will supply this information by development under the provisions and local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>The annual planning statistics compiled by each planning authority for collation and publication by my Department do not include information related to judicial reviews of decisions made by planning or local authorities in the performance of their functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, or the Planning and Development Regulations made thereunder.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, this information sought is not available in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900087#WRCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900087#WRCC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[20222\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900087#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the requests received by his Department from a county council (details supplied) for funding due to extreme weather events; the funding sought and the works proposed; when the application was submitted; the decision made on the request; the funding allocation made in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>Since 2009,\u00a0my Department has made financial support available to assist local authorities in meeting the costs of clean-up and necessary immediate works associated with the response to significant severe weather emergency events.

In that context, arrangements are being made for further discussions on the next stage of this process, which will take place in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland, and is committed\u00a0to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[20347\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of new social houses on which construction work was completed in 2017, by local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>Through the supports made available from my Department,\u00a0funding is available to all local authorities to deliver additional social housing through new construction projects,\u00a0through the acquisition of new and previously owned houses\/apartments and\u00a0through working with approved housing bodies under a range of delivery options. <\/p><p>Details on the number of new social homes delivered during 2017 under these funding initiatives, including those\u00a0built in each local authority area, for letting to those on the social housing waiting lists, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i><i>.<\/i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[20365\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of times the National Homelessness Consultation Committee has met per annum since its establishment to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[20366\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900088#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department consulted with the statistics subgroup of the National Homelessness Consultation Committee in relation to the calculation of homeless figures for March 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.<\/p><p>The National Homelessness Consultative Committee (NHCC) was established in April 2007.
