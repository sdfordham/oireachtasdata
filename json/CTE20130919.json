It is to be noted and published.  The annual accounts of Bord na gCon are before the committee for noting today.  As we have had a lot of correspondence on this body, I will deal with separately when dealing with the accounts.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.9, correspondence dated 31 August 2013 from Mr. Frank Ahern on matters arising from meeting on 20 June 2013 on the SKILL project.  It is to be noted.  We will deal with this matter when we resume the hearings with SIPTU.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.10, correspondence dated 2 September 2013 from Mr. Paul Dillon, Irish Greyhound Board.  This is to be noted.  This issue is related to the correspondence at No. 3B.8.

The Comptroller and Auditor General is to review all the papers and if there is an issue that requires further investigation he can do so.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.13, correspondence dated 20 August 2013 from Mr. Eugene Mitchell, Ballinasloe, County Galway, on flooding in Ballinasloe and alleged waste of public money by Galway County Council.  It is to be noted.  While this is primarily a matter for the local authority, funding was provided by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to alleviate flooding and it appears from Mr. Mitchell that this funding was wasted because the problem has not been solved.  As public moneys are involved here, the OPW should be satisfied that the co-funding it provided in this case was used to solve the problem.  If it did not, as appears to be the case, it should get answers from the council on what it intends to do.  We will also ask the reply to the OPW&rsquo;s request to be sent to the committee.<\/p><p>  No. 3C.1, correspondence received 16 September 2013 from Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, chief executive officer, IDA Ireland, on briefing paper on matters to be considered at today&rsquo;s meeting.  It is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 3C.2, correspondence received 18 September 2013 from Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, chief executive officer, IDA Ireland, on his opening statement.  It is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  The following items concern reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 18 July 2013.  No. 4.1, annual report of the National Pension Reserve Fund; No. 4.2, annual report and accounts for the National Treasury Management Agency; No. 4.3, financial statements for the National Development Finance Agency; No. 4.4, financial statements, Enterprise Ireland; No. 4.5, annual report for Forf&aacute;s.  In this, attention is drawn to non-effective expenditure of &euro;1.4 million incurred during 2012 on rent and associated costs related to unoccupied office space.<\/p> <p>We might schedule a meeting with Forf&aacute;s at the next available date.  No. 4.6 concerns the financial statements of the Royal Irish Academy of Music for the year ended 31 December 2012.  No. 4.7 is the 2011 annual report of the Irish Greyhound Board-Bord na gCon.  In this report, attention is drawn to the occurrence of a number of incidences of non-compliance with public procurement guidelines and a case of overpayment of prize money.  Attention is drawn to note 24 regarding ongoing concern, so I propose that we invite the Irish Greyhound Board-Bord na gCon to appear before us on 17 October 2013, which is the next available date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  No. 4.8 concerns the director's report and financial statements of Abargrove Limited for the year ended 31 December 2012.  No. 4.9 concerns the financial statements of the Irish Medicines Board for the year ended 31 December 2012.  No. 4.10 concerns the financial statements of Limerick Institute of Technology for the year ended 31 August 2012.

No. 4.12 concerns the annual report and accounts 2012 of the Health Insurance Authority.  No. 4.13 concerns the financial statements of the Adoption Authority of Ireland for the year ended 31 December 2012.  No. 4.14 is the annual report 2012 of the Carbon Fund.

No. 4.18 concerns the financial statements 2010 of the Church of Ireland College of Education.  No. 4.19 concerns the financial statements 2011 of the Church of Ireland College of Education.  No. 4.20 is the annual report 2011 of Irish Water Safety.  No. 4.21 is the annual report 2011 of Ordnance Survey Ireland.  Again, Ordnance Survey Ireland has bonus payments totalling &euro;30,000 that were not in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, so we might schedule that organisation to appear before us.  In respect of No. 4.18, why are the financial statements not up to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900003#B00500","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379581800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I do not know.

It does this by promoting Ireland as an attractive location to potential investors and through the payment of grant aid in appropriate cases and the development of industrial property.<\/p> <p>In 2012 IDA Ireland spent &euro;89 million on grant aid to industry, with almost half of this figure being spent on support for research and development activities.  IDA  Ireland has a substantial industrial property portfolio across the State which is held for the purpose of assisting the promotion and development of industry.  The portfolio had a net book value of &euro;116 million in December 2012.  Inevitably, it has not been immune from the fall in property values in recent years.  This is reflected in the cumulative provision for impairment which stood at &euro;191 million at the end of December 2012.<\/p><p> The agency's expenditure in 2012 on promotion and administration amounted to &euro;38.5 million, of which approximately &euro;9 million was spent on marketing, consultancy, promotion and advertising.  The primary source of the agency's income is Oireachtas grants which totalled &euro;132 million in 2012.  These were paid from a separate IDA  Ireland subhead of the Vote for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The agency's accounts for 2012 received a clear audit opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900004#C02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379582400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. O'Leary to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900005#D00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379582400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I shall put the role of IDA Ireland in context of the national economy.  Foreign direct investment plays a more important role in this economy than in any other European Union country.  We have a portfolio of approximately 1,050 companies that we have attracted to Ireland over the years.  They have a strong impact, with direct and indirect employment of 270,000 people and exports of &euro;122 billion in goods and services.  That accounts for more than 80% of all exports.  They spend approximately &euro;19 billion in the economy, of which &euro;7.3 billion is by way of payroll.  They are also the largest payers of corporation tax, with almost 70% of all corporation tax, as well as almost 70% of business expenditure on research and development, coming from multinationals.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland is global by nature.  We have to travel the world to identify companies and convince them to come to Ireland.  The primary market, or the one that is most productive in terms of foreign direct investment, is the United States where we have six offices.  We have three offices in Europe but in the so-called emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil we have expanded in the last six years from two offices to 11 across a variety of countries and locations.  As part of our strategy, we aim for an exceptionally high market share in the sectors on which we concentrate.  In other words, if we are going after a sector, we want to be sure we have the environment that would attract the leading companies.  Areas of particular strength in Ireland include information technology with names with which members will be familiar such as IBM, HP, Microsoft, Intel and EMC.  In the pharmaceutical sector we have nine of the top ten companies in the world, with multiple locations in Ireland.  These include Pfizer, Merck and Novartis.  In respect of medical devices, we have 17 of the top 25 global players, including Abbot, Covidien and Johnston and Johnson.  In the international financial services sector we have 50% of the leading institutions.  Citibank, BNY Mellon and State Street are the key players in this regard.  In the somewhat newer area of digital and social media we have the top ten companies, including Google, eBay and PayPal.  We target development and manufacturing, research and development and global service in these sectors.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the multinationals created 12,772 new jobs which resulted in 6,570 net jobs in IDA Ireland's portfolio.  It was the largest increase in net job numbers in more than a decade, as well as the lowest number of job losses.  Our key wins in 2012 included Allergan which will employ 200 people and invest &euro;250 million in its facility in Westport; eBay; PayPal which will employ 1,400 people in Dundalk; Nypro's creation of 200 jobs in Waterford; Fidelity's 200 jobs in Galway and Dublin; SAP in Dublin and Galway; Northern Trust which will employ 400 people in Limerick; Abbot in Sligo; Eli Lily in Cork; and Cisco in Galway.<\/p><p>  In the past two and a half years we have been targeting a sector in which we were previously not very active, namely, the emerging companies concentrated in the New York area and Silicon Valley in San Francisco.  These are young companies which have gone through one round or two rounds of venture capital funding and are the future Googles or Facebooks.  Since we started that programme we have attracted 55 of these companies.  We are active with the large multinationals, mid-size companies and, increasingly, high growth companies in the technology sector.<\/p><p>  We have observed increasing competition in the last year or two not only from emerging economies but also some of the most established economies in the world.  The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have made significant changes to their offerings and places such as Luxembourg, Singapore, Switzerland and the eastern states of the United States have also come up with attractive packages that include corporate tax offerings.<\/p><p>  A large proportion of IDA Ireland's budget is spent on what we describe as the transformation of the existing client base.  We want to make sure the world leaders we have attracted to Ireland continue to invest and transform here.  We offer a wide range of supports, including support for technology uplift, skills uplift, process improvements, research and development and energy efficiency in order to drive efficiency and place these corporations higher in their corporate world and attract new investment to Ireland.  It is fair to say Ireland's value proposition - in other words, what makes Ireland attractive to multinationals - is constantly being enhanced.  There is a constant task in maintaining the most important elements such as the talent base, our strong track record in attracting companies and getting them to reinvest in Ireland, the corporation tax offering and our technology capabilities.  Other areas are also important.  If, for example, we are trying to attract a pharmaceutical investment that could amount to &euro;250 million to &euro;500 million, we must be able to locate sites of 50 to 100 acres with access to 2 million gallons of water and 10 MW of power.<\/p><p>  I thank my colleagues in IDA Ireland for their enormous commitment, dedication and flexibility in working long hours to secure foreign direct investment for Ireland.  I have often referred to the importance of team Ireland in winning foreign direct investment.  We have worked closely with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and other Ministers in a wide range of Departments and State agencies to achieve substantial FDI benefits for Ireland.<\/p><p>  This meeting is reviewing our accounts for 2012, but in regard to our outlook, the strong flow of foreign direct investment has continued in 2013.  A number of leading companies have announced investments in new activities or the expansion of existing operations.  However, we face a challenge in that the majority of the foreign direct investment we attract to Ireland is focused on supplying markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  These markets remain flat, but we are hopeful the European market will improve.  Our efforts are firmly focused on generating a pipeline and converting it.  At any one time we need in excess of 100 investments in play around the world, for which other countries will, of course, be competing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1379582400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. O'Leary's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900005#D00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379583000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1379583000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the three witnesses for their statement, which is a fair reflection of their success.

In the EU, countries get approximately 2.4% of their GDP by way of corporation tax.  Ireland gets 2.6%, so it is higher than average, and the UK gets nearly 3%.

I think we know that and have been very good at it.  We annoy countries by being so successful in attracting so many companies into Ireland in the past 25 years.  The reason the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom are changing their tax regimes is that ours has proved to be so successful.

Notwithstanding some of the fall-outs we have had, during the past 18 months, since the beginning of 2012, we have secured approximately eight or nine investments in the biopharma area, with more to come.  It is an issue of timing.  These biopharmaceuticals are exceptionally expensive.  The cost of treatment per year ranges from between &euro;3,000 per person to &euro;120,000.  This will feed into the exports area.  Amgen is investing &euro;200 million in its biopharmaceuticals facility on Pottery Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, while Lilly is investing &euro;400 million at its facility in Cork.

Even if they did, some of what they have done is well behind the curve of what is going on across the world.

These conversions can take some time, so if we had some footprint down there we would at least be looking at it.

Kostal has approximately 800 people between Mallow and Abbeyfeale, while Liebherr in Killarney has between 500 and 600.  However, it has proved rather tough to get manufacturing in the engineering sector here because of the competitive nature of it.  In particular, much of the business is tied to the automotive industry or capital goods.  A good deal of the German investment in automotive components is going to where the big plants are and many of the big plants are going into Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, etc.  However, it is an area we continue to monitor and I believe Ovens has, thankfully, recovered competitiveness.

I will ask one or two regional questions.  Cork has been mentioned as a place that gets significant investment, and it does.  However, as we all know, Cork is a large county.  I come from north Cork, which does not get the same penetration, and I am keen to discuss that.  We have EMC in Ballincollig and VMware, which is an amazing success story that would not be there otherwise.  I know this because I have a close relationship with those involved down there.  They give great credit to Mr. O'Leary and his team for what is happening down there, and the spin-offs that have resulted for Ballincollig have been incredible.  The company has recently opened a new plant in Mahon.  Macroom has Nutricia, and Millstreet is another success story.  In the 1980s the IDA did a great deal of work there.  It is a small town - the one that I live in - with only approximately 1,500 people.  In the 1980s Apple came to Millstreet.  Then the plant closed down.  IDA Ireland came in and we now have ALPS there, which will celebrate 25 years in business this year.  It employs approximately 600 people as well as some seasonal work.  The spin-off to that area is phenomenal.  It is an example of where a region works really well because of the commitment that exists.  I was a small girl when the company came first and I do not remember all the details but my understanding is that one of our local people built the factory and it was a case of \"If you build it, they will come.\"  I am unsure whether that works all the time, but that was a good example of when it did.  However, Kanturk is a complete black spot.  There has been no investment there for several years.  Our bakeries are gone.  It is a major food and agricultural area and one would have thought that some areas could have been examined in that regard.  I have been in touch with the Cork office about Charleville on many occasions and it is an area that has a good deal of engineering.  One of the things we were asked to do by IDA Ireland was a skills survey.  We have now completed that at a cost to the community of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000 and we are getting support from the locals to figure it out.  What will the next engagement be?  Charleville is between Cork and Limerick.  There are significant numbers of people in Cork and Limerick and therefore it has a good deal of potential given its location.  How do we develop Charleville with an IDA Ireland footprint?  I appreciate that when people come here to set up businesses we do not have a choice and cannot tell them where to set up.  How can we sell some of these regions better?  Now that we have carried out the skills survey, what is the next plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013091900016#P00600","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379589000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I imagine Deputy Collins will fully understand that it is impossible to have investments for each and every town or city.

N&iacute;l i gceist ach 0.02% den bhuis&eacute;ad de &euro;55 billi&uacute;n a chaitheann an Rialtas in aghaidh na bliana.

This is their first meeting.  <\/p><p>  Today's discussion is on the September General Affairs Council, GAC, meeting.  We are delighted to be joined by our new Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  Everybody will be aware that he is an ex-member of the committee and was its Vice Chairman.  On a personal note, I must say that while he served as Vice Chairman, he was exemplary in the role, extremely helpful and diligent.  His promotion is very well deserved.  He will bring to his role a unique knowledge of European affairs, having served on the committee and led the sub-committee that examined the issues involved in one of the previous referendums.  While we are saddened that he has left the committee, we are delighted to have someone of his calibre in the position of Minister of State.  He is very welcome.  He will attend the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 30 September when the Council is expected to discuss EU cohesion policy which, as we all know, has a profound impact on Europe's poorer regions.  We would like to hear from him on how he expects the GAC meeting to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900002#A00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1379595600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your kind words, Chairman.  I am delighted to be with the committee members.  My appearance at the committee is striking for two reasons - at least, it is striking for me - the first being that I spent seven very happy years working with it on matters about which we were concerned.  I had the privilege of being a member of the committee as a Senator and then being its Vice Chairman.<\/p> <p>I then worked with some members, most notably Deputy Timmy Dooley, on an Oireachtas sub-committee in which I was involved while serving as a Senator.  It is a real privilege for me to be present working with members in my new role.  <\/p><p> Another reason my appearance before the committee is particularly striking for me is that today is my birthday.  I could not think of a nicer group of people with whom I would want to spend the afternoon of my birthday and if that does not get our relationship off to a good start, I am not sure what will.  On that relationship, I wish to make clear a couple of points.  I note the value with which I hold the committee and with which I accord my ability to work effectively with members.  In this regard, this meeting is an opportunity to speak to members about both the forthcoming General Affairs Council, GAC, meeting and what my priorities will be as Minister of State.  In the weeks since my appointment I have had the opportunity to consult colleagues and stakeholders and have a discussion on what I believe my important priorities should be and on how I will deliver on them.  That is now clear in my mind and while there will be little in the discussion I will have with members that will surprise or be new to them, this is the first place in which I will have that discussion.  I have not spoken about my priorities elsewhere since my appointment and it is appropriate that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs be the place within which these priorities and ideas are enunciated and I have the opportunity to talk to members, get their feedback on them and hear what areas they believe are particularly important.  In the time available to me I also wish to address that issue and to make a few comments on where the European Union stands.  Previous summits the committee has discussed have been characterised by the frequency of economic crises and difficulty.  Recent weeks and months have I hope provided some signs on where the European Union, its institutions, peoples and economy stand.  I also wish to make some overall comments in that regard.<\/p><p> Before turning to those areas, I will take up the committee's invitation to speak about the forthcoming General Affairs Council.  I make the point that I am speaking to members a considerable time before the meeting takes place.  Consequently, a fair amount of detail will only be filled in between now and the actual Council meeting.  This is because some decisions have yet to be taken.  If any member probes or asks me about these particular points, I simply will be obliged to acknowledge them and state that when there is greater clarity on how matters have progressed before the meeting, I will be in a better position to address such questions and appear again before the committee.<\/p><p> The forthcoming General Affairs Council is notable for being the first formal General Affairs Council meeting that will take place as a Union of 28 member states.  Many members were highly supportive of the accession of Croatia to the European Union and I had an opportunity to meet my new colleague at the informal meeting that took place in Vilnius at the end of August.  The value Croatia accords to membership of the European Union is greatly striking both because of the journey it has made to get to that point and because of the value it believes such membership to have.  I will take the opportunity to formally indicate how warmly the Government welcomes Croatia to the European Union and state it looks forward to working with it.  I have alluded to the point that the forthcoming gathering of the General Affairs Council is not actually the first Lithuanian Presidency event for Ministers such as me.  I attended the informal meeting the Presidency held at the end of August and I will return to that meeting presently.<\/p><p> As for the GAC agenda which has been circulated to members, the main item for discussion at the meeting is the cohesion policy legislative package.  Members are aware that one of the main roles of such meetings is to prepare the agenda for the subsequent European Council meeting, that is, the meeting of the Heads of Government and State.  The General Affairs Council plays a key role in preparing the agenda for that meeting.  I do not need to tell this committee about the huge importance of the European Union&rsquo;s cohesion spending or policy for the Union or Ireland.  It lies at the heart of the jobs and growth agenda for the Continent in the future, just as it has been a primary instrument in the past in ensuring counrties such as Ireland can prosper and make the most of the opportunities the European Union can afford to them.  In the future it will be one of the primary instruments available to the Union to drive investment and promote growth and job creation.  As I have emphasised, the Government is well aware of the value of this policy, its investment and the big difference it has made to Ireland.  It is expected that during the lifetime of the forthcoming programme Ireland will receive approximately &euro;1 billion in Structural Funds between the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and the European Social Fund, ESF.  Notably, I acknowledge the special provisions of &euro;100 million for the Border, midlands and western region and &euro;50 million for the PEACE programme which the Government secured in the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.<\/p><p> In the forthcoming discussion the focus will be on finalising the package of cohesion-related legislative instruments on which the Irish Presidency had been leading until the summer.  As many members will be aware, during that period the Irish Presidency made significant progress in advancing this dossier and, in particular, the negotiations with the European Parliament.  An enormous effort went into this, for which I thank everyone involved.  It consisted of almost 90 trilogues under the Irish Presidency alone across the six files that comprise the legislative package.  This is very technical with links to the multi-annual financial framework and the logistical challenges of dealing with six separate parliamentary negotiating teams.  Under Ireland's chairmanship, the Council endorsed agreements reached between the Parliament and the Irish Presidency on four of the regulations that form part of the overall &euro;325 billion package of cohesion funding.  Agreement was also reached on 90% of the key common provisions regulations.  In addition, agreement was reached on a key element of the European Social Fund regulation, namely, a minimum share for the ESF.  However, our colleagues in the Lithuanian Presidency still have a number of significant issues to be addressed, most notably on macroeconomic conditionality and the performance reserve, both of which are related to the multi-annual financial framework.  The priorities for the different funds will be threefold, namely, combating long-term and youth unemployment and social exclusion, the promotion of research and development investment and the competitiveness of the business sector and the promotion of an environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient economy.<\/p><p> The ERDF funding primarily will be allocated for research and innovation, supporting SMEs and energy efficiency, while the ESF funding will support important human capital programmes in the labour market such as upskilling and activation measures.  Consideration will also be given to supporting territorial co-operation programmes such as the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  Given the importance of cohesion spending for the growth agenda, I wish the Lithuanian Presidency the best of luck in making progress on this programme.  It will be crucial for agreement to be reached on the nuts and bolts behind all of these programmes in order that member states, obviously including Ireland, can get on with spending and investing this money on the important priorities.<\/p><p> The next item on the GAC agenda is the formal presentation of the annotated draft agenda for the October European Council.  In this regard, I reiterate that one of the main roles of the General Affairs Council is to prepare the agenda for the European Council.  In the outline work programme for the European Council up to 2014 President Van Rompuy has earmarked the digital agenda and innovation policy for attention at the October meeting.  In so far as the digital agenda is concerned, members will recall that the compact for growth and jobs sets the clear objective of having a well functioning digital single market by 2014.  This is an area in which important progress was made during the Irish Presidency, including taking forward work on the collective rights management, data protection and e-identification files.<\/p> <p>We also hosted a very successful Digital Agenda Assembly in Dublin Castle at the end of June.  As signalled in her contribution to the Digital Agenda Assembly, the Commissioner, Ms Kroes, produced important proposals on 12 September for the development of a single telecommunications market.  These are positioned as a key enabler for further development of the digital economy.  In so far as innovation policy is concerned, the key contribution of the Irish Presidency was, of course, finalisation of the political agreement on the &euro;70 billion Horizon 2020 package under the new MFF.  The next step is to seek to maximise the impact of what will be the world's largest public research programme.  This agenda for the October European Council will be available on Monday.  The final item is a possible update from the Lithuanian Presidency on files in the co-decision process with Parliament, which is a useful reference list, but not intended for any discussion.<\/p><p> I stated at the outset that I wanted to give the committee an update on the discussion that took place in the informal meeting in which I participated in Vilnius at the end of August.  The theme of that discussion is something that this committee has grappled with and discussed over the past number of years.  The two themes were clear and straightforward; first, how do we ensure democratic accountability of European political institutions; and second, how can we promote greater public engagement in EU affairs.  These are vital issues all the time but they are hugely important now in the run-up to the European Parliament elections next summer.  The informal meeting in Vilnius focused very much on these issues in the context of those elections but also, importantly, in the context of relations between the Council and the European Parliament after the summer elections.<\/p><p> Under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, the European Parliament has been given increased capacity in many areas that matter deeply to citizens, and a subject of discussion was how that capacity would be exercised in the future, what the role of the Parliament would be, how the MEPs would exercise their responsibilities and how Council would respond.  A theme of the discussion that took place was the declining voter turnout at recent European elections.  There was broad agreement on the need to communicate actions taken at EU level to citizens between now and the poll in order to reverse this trend.  The benefits of EU membership are all too often taken for granted - for example, the Single Market and the role that European institutions play in the national economy and in protecting countless jobs across Ireland and the EU.  In other words, we must find a way of focusing the debate on the bread-and-butter issues impacting on citizens' lives rather than on institutional discussions that mean little to them.  I am of the view that we should ban the use of the word \"institution\" in public discussions.  Given everything in which Europe is involved and given the role that the national Parliament plays within it, we need to refocus on language that is meaningful to citizens.  We in Ireland are best positioned to do that because of the role of referendums in our decision making, but we will all be aware that when we talk to those we represent about issues such as the two-pack, the six-pack, automaticity, the Stability and Growth Pact and trialogue, we wonder what they mean to them.  Of course we know about the outputs; what matters to people is their lives, their health, their work and their ability to access work.  However, I am struck by how much time we spend talking about the inputs and processes involved, as opposed to the outputs of all of this work, which makes a difference to people and which we know they all care about.  These issues will also feature prominently in COSAC meeting discussions next month under the Lithuanian Presidency, which I will miss attending, because I always found them informative and interesting.  I am sure the committee will continue to play an important role in it.<\/p><p> The core theme of my contribution in that meeting was the role of the European Parliament.  The point that I underscored to colleagues is that, while we all appreciate the increased role of the European Parliament under the Lisbon treaty, when a country is involved in delivering a Presidency, the Parliament and the amount of time one must spend with the Parliament become exceptionally important.  The Parliament's role in co-decision making and in all the different ways in which decisions are made is immensely important, and a point we made is that this needs to be recognised in terms of time set aside as colleagues prepare for and deliver future Presidencies.<\/p><p> We also had a discussion on the idea of how we can ensure respect for the institutional - there I am, using the word \"institution\" again - balance laid out in the treaties regarding who should do what and how, and how to ensure that the roles that different persons play are in accordance with the roles assigned to them under the treaties for which the people have voted.  This is something on which I and everybody else who contributed on that day focused.<\/p><p> I look forward to attending the next plenary session of the European Parliament in October and to meeting key contacts to underline the priority that the Government attaches to the European Parliament and to the main issues on which it is working that are crucial to the national interest, such as the MFF, completion of the banking union and agreement on legislation that supports growth and job creation.<\/p><p> I have already mentioned the October European Council on the digital agenda and innovation policy for Europe.  The themes of the European Council in December will be enlargement, defence and the report from President Van Rompuy on economic and monetary union.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, the focus of the European semester in the second half of the year is on national implementation of the country-specific recommendations through the budget processes, which, of course, is one of the reasons our budget will be held sooner this year.  The European semester is all about how national budgets are put together and the role of others in having a look at those budgets and understanding the impact they will have on their own economy and the economy across Europe.  This is a new system.  It is one with which we in Ireland are familiar regarding the discussion on the fiscal governance treaty last year.  The operation of the European semester in the first half of the year will be subjected to a review and a lessons-learned paper will be produced and brought to the General Affairs Council in November-December.  The Irish Presidency's management of the semester process in the first half of 2013 was successful, but in a new and complex process it is helpful to review and refine procedures for the following year, and the GAC will do this.<\/p><p> On enlargement, the accession of Croatia to the Union was a great start to this six-month period.  In the lead-up to consideration at the December European Council, the Lithuanian Presidency will have to see what progress can be made on advancement with Montenegro, Turkey and Serbia.  The enlargement package will be published in October, with draft Council conclusions discussed at the October GAC.<\/p><p> Finally, the GAC is scheduled to consider the draft directive on maritime spatial planning in November, with the aim of agreeing a general approach on the text for future negotiations with the European Parliament.  The Greek Presidency in 2014 will then lead the negotiations with the Parliament.<\/p><p> I am happy to listen to the views of members of this committee on the General Affairs Council agenda, and to answer questions in that regard as well as I can.  I am conscious of how long I have been speaking but I want to conclude with some observations on the areas on which I want to work that I have identified as being priorities for my time in this role, which I look forward to speaking to the committee about in the weeks and months to come.  There are four areas that I have identified as being both appropriate to this role and essential to delivering the programme for Government commitments that are laid down with regard to our engagement with Europe and the engagement of our institutions - there I go again - of Parliament here in Ireland with Europe.  The first, an obvious one but one that we know really matters, is effective representation through ministerial engagements and public diplomacy.<\/p> <p>That means that throughout the coming months I will be a frequent visitor to the European Parliament during plenary session.  In my earlier contribution I identified for members the important role the European Parliament is playing and will play.  By attending frequently during plenary session, I will have the opportunity to meet contacts in the European Parliament and make advances on issues we know to be important and in the national interest.  Alongside this, I will be representing the country with the T&aacute;naiste at the General Affairs Council and travelling with both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to various meetings.  In particular, I will be travelling to the European Council meetings with the Taoiseach.  I look forward to engaging at these meetings and with public media.  In my first foray abroad, when I visited Copenhagen, I spent some of the afternoon in a discussion with Danish media on what was happening regarding Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the European Union.  I outlined the difficulties we had in talking about the European Union and what we did well when we talked about it at home.  I was delighted to participate in a radio interview in that regard and I am looking forward to visiting Lisbon next Tuesday.  I will be participating in a conference with journalists on what is happening in Ireland and the work that is under way.<\/p><p> The second area of great importance is cross-government engagement and work.  Simply put, what matters very much to all of us stretches across more than one Department in terms of how we engage with the European Union.  My colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are the key people in developing and implementing our cohesion policy.  Their work has considerable consequences for other Departments.  Work on which we are engaging in the European Union on unemployment, including youth unemployment, and the digital economy stretches across more than just one Department.  I will have a role in accelerating the work of our engagement group to ensure we can identify cross-departmental priorities and work on and communicate them effectively.<\/p><p> The third area on which I want to touch is our proposals and scrutiny by our national Parliament of EU directives.  I spent the morning in the Seanad debating a directive on child pornography and the dissemination over the Internet of images of violence against children.  I would very much welcome the opportunity to work with the Chairman and colleagues on our scrutiny processes, as they stand, particularly the change we have made regarding sectoral evaluation.  Transport issues, for example, will be handled by the committee responsible for transport, as opposed to the committee responsible for European scrutiny, as was the case when Deputy Bernard J. Durkan was Chairman.<\/p><p> The final area I have identified is public understanding of the European Union.  I want to examine what we are doing in regard to the Blue Star Programme for primary schools and how it can be developed and strengthened.  I will be looking forward to many public engagements on how we talk about the European Union to the people, schools, trade unions, businesses and academics.  I am particularly conscious of the view people hold on the European Union because I was involved in work on this issue a number of years ago.  I refer to people younger than me who may have a different view on the European Union than the one I held when I grew up.  They look at debates and events in the European Union very differently from previous generations.<\/p><p> I have identified the four areas on which I want to focus.  While I am conscious that there is nothing that will come as a surprise to any of the members, I have made a point of making the committee the first place at which I have talked about my objectives.  Thus, members know where I am coming from.<\/p><p> The other area that will be of real interest to me, on which I touched publicly, is the debate in the United Kingdom on the European Union.  We should be very clear that Ireland, as a country that regularly holds referendums, recognises fully the right of any other country to do exactly the same as us.  However, I hope to work with members publicly on the consequences for Ireland of a debate in another country on future membership of the European Union.  What could it mean?  What will happen is unclear, for very obvious reasons.  So much is contingent on the composition of the next UK Parliament and who will be in government.  I will emphasise again that we recognise and appreciate the need for other countries to have such debates and make their own decisions, but in doing so we must not be blind to the fact that decisions other countries make can have considerable consequences for us.  We are well capable of engaging publicly in the necessary nuanced manner.<\/p><p> I have outlined the various blocks of work on which I hope to follow up.  I thank members for giving me the opportunity to attend.  I am sorry I have spoken for so long, but this is my first time here.  I will do my best to be briefer in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900002#A00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379596800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Paschal Donohoe who is present for the first time in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I wish him well in his role as Minister of State and congratulate him on his assessment of circumstances Europe-wide.  I have a couple of questions that I believe need to be addressed.<\/p><p>  At the June Council meeting the Heads of State agreed on the issue of youth unemployment and identified certain procedures in that regard.  Will the Minister of State comment on the progress made because it affects us all in each member state?  If possible, I would like to receive an update.<\/p><p>  The investment plan for Europe reflects SMEs and the mobilisation of European Investment Bank resources.  It has come to my attention recently that citizens are affected in this and other European countries by the fact that many SMEs have had their credit ratings seriously damaged.  As we know, the damage to the credit rating of the country can seriously debilitate its ability to assert itself economically and make progress.  The principal of a company or small business, for example, might have found the company&rsquo;s credit rating damaged and might have had the business referred to the credit bureau, with the consequence that it could not make progress, borrow money or receive any consideration for five years.  For five years the company must remain stagnant.  This should be dealt with at national and European level.  The Minister of State might consider this.<\/p><p>  I particularly welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s appraisal of the enlargement process and the necessity to keep it on track.  He might indicate the extent of progress on banking union because it was mentioned at the June Council meeting.<\/p><p>  Ireland has made huge sacrifices in recent years, as the Chairman and every member knows.  There has been considerable progress and improvement in recent years as a result of these sacrifices.  I hope our European colleagues are fully conversant with the sacrifices made and the progress made to date.  An example of progress is the net rate of job creation in the country in the past 12 months or so.  It has been spectacular.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State has commented on the possible withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in the aftermath of a referendum.  What would be the consequences of such an outcome for the European Union in general, the special Ireland-UK relationship and the common travel area, etc.?  What is the potential for damage to the very concept of the European Union in the event that one country is seen to withdraw from it?<\/p> <p>In any such situation negotiations have to take place.  As the Minister of State has said, each member state has the right to determine its own future in this regard.  However, we are in a Union and there are consequences in the event of any fallout.  If one country breaks from that Union the concept of the Union is gone and may be irreparably damaged.  In my opinion it will have disastrous consequences for the UK.  It will certainly have disastrous consequences for this country and for Northern Ireland, as well as for the European Union itself.  The withdrawal of a major power from the Union will be hugely negative in terms of the perception of that Union worldwide.<\/p><p> I am sure the Minister of State and others have noticed that there is currently a growth in fervent nationalism within the EU, which is not conducive to a Union.  As the Minister of State said, the EU's institutions constantly strive to make themselves more relevant to the electorate.  However, it is equally essential that that nationalism be recognised and addressed in some way.  If we do have the development of ultra-nationalism in the future there will be no Union because the two cannot co-exist.  There could be further disastrous consequences.  There are many issues that the EU and its institutions have to address in the near future rather than in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900005#D00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379597400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has presented a lot of interesting information and ideas on how he sees his role.  He is as familiar as anyone with the problem of youth unemployment.  There is a lack of urgency across Europe concerning this matter.  I hope that in his new role the Minister of State will try to tackle that problem urgently.  According to those involved in youth work, both here and abroad, many young people are disengaging.  There are 2,249 people on the live register in my own area of Tallaght.  In the neighbouring constituency, there are 1,223 on the live register in Clondalkin.  However, a significant number of young people are not signing on.  They are outside the system and are disengaging, which will cause difficulties.  I can guarantee that that is happening right across Europe as well.  It is clearly urgent that we deal with this problem.  How does the Minister of State propose to speed up and front-load youth employment initiatives, including the youth guarantee?  How can we instil urgency in dealing with the difficulties involved?  Can the Minister of State outline what the Government will do to speed up and expand such initiatives?<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to social inclusion.  Role models are the key for those who are excluded from society.  From our local authority work we know what can be done about that.  There is no point in local or national government discussing the matter unless they create specific plans.  For instance, South Dublin County Council put Travellers in front-line positions such as customer care.  People with disabilities are also being put in front so that the public meet them.  The Government should come up with novel ideas in this area.<\/p><p>  One of the areas we examined in trying to deal with youth unemployment was the use of JobBridge interns.  We had the example of 14 Departments employing 228 interns, but not one of them was kept on due to the jobs embargo.  What message does that send out to the rest of society if the Government is not taking a lead?  Whom can we ask to take the lead if the Administration does not do so?<\/p><p>  The Minister of State talked about cross-Border initiatives and he is familiar with the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900006#E00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1379597400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900006#E00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1379597400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The Narrow Water Bridge project is a key component of that, which symbolises the unity of people rather than the divisions between them.

It is a worrying development, particularly given the extent to which the Commission has been driving the troika's austerity programme.  Can the Minister of State outline the timeline for this potential interference in our budgetary process by the Commission?  Can he guarantee that any changes proposed by the Commission will revert to the Oireachtas for discussion?  Can he outline what the procedure would be if there was a disagreement between the Government and the Commission over the proposed budgetary changes demanded by the latter?<\/p><p>  The Minister of State is right about the language being used, including terms such as \"six-pack\" and \"two-pack\".

He has a considerable track record and I have no doubt that he will continue his work in a non-partisan manner, demonstrating humility every step of the way.  It has been a hallmark of his time on this committee.  I am being absolutely sincere about it because for seven or eight years I worked on this committee with Deputy Donohoe before he was appointed to his new ministerial portfolio.  We have always had a good working relationship that was based on putting the interests of the country ahead of any self-interest.  That is why I am delighted he was chosen for ministerial office.  He can maintain that non-partisanship which is so important for this country.  We should not divide along standard political lines, which has happened in more recent times, on the issue of Europe.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will continue with the non-partisan approach.  There are huge challenges, which he has set out today.  They include issues that have arisen at the European Council and elsewhere.  I look forward to seeing the Minister of State's efforts in that regard.<\/p><p>  The crisis of spiralling unemployment is the big issue that Europe is attempting to resolve.  It is bedevilling not just us but the rest of Europe also.  The Minister of State has identified the necessity of front-loading youth employment initiatives as well as speeding up the implementation of the youth guarantee.  These are hugely important matters.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to suggest more ideas to resolve that problem.<\/p><p>  He also referred to institutional reform and his work with the European Parliament.  It is important to assist the citizens of this State in having a better understanding of what our participation in Europe can do for us.  We have been good at blaming Europe for so much, but that will not be a feature of the Minister of State's period in office.  I am sure he will explain what we can and cannot expect from Europe.  Anything we can do to focus on job creation is critical.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the digital agenda and innovation policy, but we also need to focus on mainstream, blue-collar jobs.  Because the central focus in Europe is the drive for innovation and new technology, we often lose sight of blue-collar jobs which are the bedrock of economic activity across Europe.<\/p> <p>That has been a loss to Ireland.  While it does not fall within the Minister&rsquo;s remit, we have focused too much on this notional value chain.  The higher up one goes, the further one gets from the notion of being a low-cost economy and there is potential for everyone.  The fact of the matter is for many there will not be.  We have got to bring that back into the discussion.  When one raises the digital agenda and new technologies, it can turn many off.<\/p><p> The Minister of State referred to the necessity to deal with the banking crisis and the European banking union.  Unfortunately, the relatively slow pace of development in this area is damaging to the perception of Europe.  We have identified the lack of a banking union as a significant problem to the eurozone.  We have set ourselves the task of implementing such a union but we are slow in our approach.  I am not suggesting this is the fault of the Irish but our citizens would like to see a much speedier resolution to this matter.  I understand there are significant issues concerning its establishment but we need to see a greater involvement.<\/p><p> I wish the Minister of State well.  He has a difficult task but he is the right person for the job.  I look forward to him attending the committee in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900006#E00500","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379598000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and colleagues for their comments.

I have no doubt during my tenure in office I will get sucked into using the same language.  At the beginning of my opening statement, I spoke about banning the use of the word \"institution\" and then used it throughout my contribution.  I welcome the fact that many members spoke about outputs and what comes out of Europe.<\/p><p>  Deputies Durkan and Crowe spoke about the tragedy of youth unemployment.  I agree with Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s point about the impact it has on young people for the rest of their lives.  It changes the options a young person will have as they move through life.  The multi-annual financial framework has set aside moneys for projects, such as the youth guarantee, to tackle youth unemployment.<\/p><p>  The reason the banking union is so important is that we need to get credit in Europe flowing for businesses and families.  The three elements of the union will be the single supervisory mechanism, which will deal with how banks, particularly those that stretch across many borders, are regulated, the resolution framework to deal with failed banks and the deposit guarantee scheme.  We are expecting the Lithuanian EU Presidency to produce clear proposals on the latter element.  Much work is being done on the supervisory mechanism and the role of the European Central Bank in this.  It is expected to have it up and running at a near and credible date.  We expect further negotiations with the European Parliament to take place on the resolution element.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan made the point about the sacrifice of the Irish people.  I will never miss an opportunity to make that point in Europe.  Along with commentary on Ireland&rsquo;s progress in dealing with its programme, we need to point out the terrible sacrifices our people have made in dealing with the mistakes of the past.  I always offer the example of the changes in our budgets to bridge the gap between taxation and spending.  By the time our commitments are upheld, we will have implemented a total package of adjustment that represents one fifth of our national income.  That is an extraordinary level of change for any country to undergo.  It is at the very top of adjustments any country has made since the Second World War.  I will never miss the opportunity to make clear to European colleagues that whatever progress we have made has been due to the sacrifices our people have made.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Durkan's point about the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, it is in our and the EU&rsquo;s interest for the United Kingdom to be a positive and significant player in the Union for years to come.  We have to weigh up the UK&rsquo;s expectations alongside our national interests.  We must also recognise that the European Union cannot renegotiate itself from scratch now.  Member states have joined with a knowledge of what it is to be a member along with its commitments and responsibilities.<\/p> <p> I have tried to respond to some points made by Deputy Crowe and will return to one more in respect of the role of the Commission.  I will touch on a point made by Deputy Dooley and I thank him in his absence for the nice things he said about me.  I assure him I will always do my best to maintain it as long as he does.<\/p><p> I appreciate the point he made about my interest in Europe and how I talk about it but that is underpinned by my real belief that if the parties of the centre, centre-left and centre-right cannot come together to deal with the vast crisis we face, who can?  What will replace parties in the future if we cannot rise to the historic challenge Europe faces?  I am certain that we will and am confident we are making progress in that regard but it behoves us to acknowledge that amidst the debate in Ireland among most, though not all, of us, we agree about more things in Europe than we differ on.  <\/p><p> In respect of the point made by Deputy Crowe about the role of the Commission in our budget, this is a consequence of the different governance measures that are already in place like the misnamed six-pack, the two-pack and the fiscal governance treaty.  I genuinely take a different view of this compared to that held by Deputy Crowe.  I believe the difficulties we have had in Ireland have been compounded by the difficulties in other countries at the same time.<\/p><p> There are two reasons I believe the new procedures are in our national interest.  If we act in a way that is in accordance with what our own fiscal advisory council will recommend and in a way that recognises our own understanding of how we need to frame good national budgets in the future, the kind of restraints and oversight that are there will, hopefully, never been encountered.  I strongly believe that as we frame budgets in the future in line with suggestions from the fiscal advisory council and the new oversight mechanisms within the Oireachtas, we will not trigger the role of the Commission and other bodies.  In respect of the warnings made by other bodies regarding the overheating of our economy in the past, which we in Ireland chose not to heed, if we all had our time again and those warnings were articulated again, we might act differently.  <\/p><p> My second point concerning the role of the Commission and other bodies goes back to the point that if other countries have the opportunity to frame their budgets in particular ways, it will, hopefully, prevent the kind of events that have happened in the past from happening again.  What we now know is that as significant as they are, if we were only faced with our difficulties, we would probably have the measure of them on our own.  What has made the past few years so difficult is the fact that we have had to deal with our own difficulties and the consequences of different countries' difficulties.  I believe the treaty we passed and the new procedures in which we will be participating constitute the best and most rational way of ensuring that does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900007#F00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379598600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and welcome the Minister of State to the meeting.  In respect of the priorities he highlighted, I very much agree with him regarding the understanding of people's views of Europe and what Europe is about.  I am not sure whether this has been adequately done over the years by members of the European Parliament.  In many cases, they are more involved in many local issues than in the European project, which is regrettable.  It might be interesting to see what words come to mind when one mentions the European Parliament to people.  Do they think of austerity, EU directives, regulations or unemployment?  It might be interesting to compare that in terms of generations because people of a different age would look at the EU in terms of stability, growth and what it has done for Ireland and other countries across the region.  It would be interesting to do that survey and see what results one would get.<\/p><p>  I know the youth guarantee is very important.  There is a pilot project in Ballymun at the moment.  The Minister for Social Protection has stated that the European Parliament and the Commission have yet to reach agreement on the qualifying criteria for funding the youth employment initiative.  This is delaying applications for funding so it is important that this is sorted.  <\/p><p>  In respect of the Cohesion Fund, we lost out in the last round because we were higher than the 90% average of European funding, which is a positive thing.  Unfortunately, we lost out in that last round so are there any plans to change the criteria in respect of the next round?  Ireland's average figure at that time was &euro;38,970, while the EU average was &euro;33,609 so we were higher than 90% of the European average.  Are there plans for that?<\/p><p>  In respect of the European Regional Development Fund and European territorial co-operation which is one of the European regional policies and involves cross-border activities and the development of transnational co-operation, we have one trans-European border, which is Northern Ireland as part of the UK.  Do countries with large numbers of EU neighbours like France, Belgium and the Netherlands benefit disproportionately, particularly if we are losing out in respect of the Cohesion Fund?  The Minister of State might have some views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900008#G00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1379598600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Is that in respect of regional funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900008#G00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1379598600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Regional funding relating to the European territorial co-operation objective.

When I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I was allocated the office of Deputy Rabbitte who had to vacate it because he was promoted to Minister.  With the reshuffle coming down the line, am I on a trajectory?  I am a big admirer of the Minister of State and very much value his contribution.<\/p><p>  I want to follow up some issues he raised this morning.  In respect of language, believe it or not but I do try to read my agendas and the documentation that accompany them before I come here.  I started with the 2012 report on inter-parliamentary relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon.  I got as far as the three-page introduction.  Frankly, for those of us who are supposed to be educated parliamentarians to expect the punter on the road to be able to understand any of the language in it is really pushing it.<\/p><p>  I will tell the Minister of State why I am concerned about language and I concur with him.  During the last fiscal treaty debate, I was doing tallies.  The boxes at which I was looking were those for Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot.  The &quot;No&quot; votes in these boxes were between 80% and 90%.  As the boxes were being opened, it seemed that the more one approached the Terenure-Rathgar and Terenure-Rathfarnham end of the constituency, the vote was 80% in favour.  It is very telling that everybody is not an <i>Irish Times<\/i> reader.  There is a huge segment of our society that is disconnected from national politics but, more clearly, does not know much about European politics.  As public representatives, we are regularly invited to schools to speak to schoolchildren - ostensibly as Deputies. There is an incredible confusion on the part of teaching staff and students as to what a Deputy does in the Parliament and confusion about the role of local government and that of the European Parliament and our role in Europe.<\/p> <p>We have to send an important message to the grassroots about our role in Europe and its importance to us as citizens.  The Minister of State referred to the blue star programme.  I worry that the funding we have successfully drawn from Europe may be absorbed into central government funding in some shape or form so that when it is regurgitated to communities, there is no awareness of its composition.  They will think it is coming from the Government.  When European moneys are spent on social purposes, we should emphasise that the benefits accruing to disadvantaged communities are due to Europe's role in funding and developing society.  I am particularly fond of the URBAN programme in Ballyfermot which transformed the area to the point where it is unrecognisable as a result of the EU's investment.  There are other forms of social investment in respect of which we are not able to point to the results of our membership of the EU.<\/p><p> In regard to the international projection of Europe and the role of Britain, Germany and France, certain countries - the Minister mentioned Lithuania - have undergone tremendous pain.  This committee will be visiting Latvia, which I understand would put the Croke Park agreement to shame.  Pay cuts of 40% were imposed on the country's public service.  These countries are suffering just as we are suffering.  We should develop greater cohesion with the people of these countries.  Other examples are Portugal, Spain, Greece and Cyprus.  I understand Slovenia may also be facing financial difficulties.  Is the political system so divided, even on national terms, that we cannot create an Irish cohesiveness in the European Parliament in order to liaise with these countries?  In other words, the Fine Gael group is affiliated to the liberal whatever and the Labour Party group is affiliated to social democrats.  Does that undermine the unity of purpose of our MEPs?<\/p><p> We have been successful in stabilising the euro as a world currency.  I congratulate Croatia and applaud the progressive steps being taken by other countries.  Latvia will be in the eurozone from 1 January 2014.  The biggest demands on the Irish Presidency were growth, jobs and stability.  We achieved stability but jobs and growth are the next tasks.<\/p><p> I wish the Minister of State every success on the Cohesion Fund and social funding.  Perhaps one day he will report back in regard to my cynicism about the &euro;50 million being spent on the peace agreement.  It appears to me that Northern Ireland is becoming more sectarian.  It does not appear that the loyalist working class see any benefits.  We might also address the divide in Cyprus some day and find out whether we can reopen the port of Famagusta.  As Europeans, we are responsible to our neighbours.  We are spending a lot of money on the peace agreement and I would like to know where it is being spent.  There are dangerous tensions in Northern Ireland between the increasing sophistication of paramilitaries and the likelihood of a bombing campaign that will kill people.  That would set this country back years, notwithstanding the growth of business links and the attempts of business people in Northern Ireland to obtain international recognition as a civilised modern region.  Where is this money going and is it going to the Cherry Orchards and Ballyfermots of Belfast?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900008#G00500","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379599200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind words of welcome and I look forward to playing a constructive role as a member.

Deputy Kyne suggested an interesting research project that would ask people what they think of when they think about Europe.  The research with which I am familiar includes the Eurobarometer polls conducted across Europe.  These polls clearly demonstrate that people's faith in European institutions declined during the crisis.  However, I would put this in context with two other findings from the same polls.  First, faith and trust in European political institutions are higher in many cases than their faith in national political institutions, although faith in both sets of institutions has fallen dramatically.  Second, when people were asked what they consider the right level of response to the current difficulties, many, and the majority in some cases, think the right level is higher than their own national governments.<\/p> <p>Many people understand - as we do in this room - that just as the causes of our difficulties stretch beyond what happens within our borders, so too do the levels of an effective response, and they are greater than that which we can influence on our own.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct to say that the levels of engagement and understanding shift across age groups.  For many years the narrative of peace - Europe in the context of the end of the Second World War and the Cold War - kept Europe going.  As that began to mean less to some people, a new narrative came along that drove policies such as the Single Market and the euro, which are ideas about a prosperous Europe with economic growth.  That vision is now in the difficulty we are grappling with.  We all need to work together to come up with new ideas that energise people again.<\/p><p> However, I am cautious about that approach.  Deputy Eric Byrne mentioned the Baltic region.  If a person spends any time there, they will find that a Europe that is peaceful and underpins security matters to them too.  I am certainly aware that different ideas will mean different things to different countries at different times.  I am attending the eastern partnership summit in a few months' time which will consider enlargement and our policy with countries to the east, where the idea of security matters deeply for reasons that the Deputy will be aware of.<\/p><p> That said, Ireland and other western European countries must rethink what Europe will mean as it moves forward.  We spend so much time talking about having a banking or a fiscal union, but surely we need to spend as much time talking about the cultural values that underpin the European Union and what we have in common.  I look forward to having the opportunity to talk about the simple idea that we will be able to face the challenges and realise the opportunities more successfully if we do it together.  National governments are at their best in responding to questions such as how to grow a digital economy when doing it together.  Finding ways to talk about working together and, more important, showing people that we are doing it is important in coming up with the next set of ideas that I hope will propel Europe forward.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne mentioned specific ideas about the youth guarantee.  Broadly speaking, while there is agreement at the top level about the quantity of money to be spent, we must reach agreement on the nuts and bolts in order that it can be done quickly.  On the perceived losses referred to, we have not lost out on the quantity of funding in different funding negotiations.  However, as Deputy Kyne is aware, the BMW region will be more developed than it is at the moment and that will impact on the funding levels that it can access.  The Government was successful in securing a special allocation of &euro;100 million for that region to allow us to do all we can to get ourselves well placed for funding negotiations and challenges we may face.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne concurred with me on some of the language difficulties we face.  An analogy crossed my mind when I heard him speak.  I have no clue about and I am useless at understanding how engines work.  Whenever something breaks down in my car, I reach for the manual in the glove compartment with a sense of terror certain in the fact that I will not understand most of what it says.  However, I know how to drive a car from A to B.  That takes us back to the point made at the start of the meeting.  Deputy Byrne is right.  I know that he reads all the material and he grapples with the issues in the same way I do, but perhaps we need to spend as much time talking about the consequences of that work as we do about the work itself.  The simple point Deputy Byrne made would appear to be essential in doing that, which is that as we begin to translate the agreements the Government has successfully achieved into work on the ground, we must acknowledge that in the work on the ground.  In the past we acknowledged that the roads and all the other projects we benefited from were either co-funded or funded from Europe.  We need to do the same for the European funded programmes we are talking about.<\/p><p> I note the point that was made about Northern Ireland.  There is no need to say that Deputy Byrne and I feel the same way about the issue, which is that we need to ensure that the dark picture he painted does not happen.  I want to praise the extraordinary speech our T&aacute;naiste, the Labour Party leader, made recently at the British-Irish Association conference in Cambridge in which he talked about the need to be courageous in how we develop and advance reconciliation and understanding across communities in the North given such difficulties still exist.  I hope to play what role I can in that work.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne also made an important point about the stability of the euro.  When the promissory notes were a problem, that was all we talked about.  Now that the Government has successfully dealt with the issue, however, no one talks about it.  Bearing in mind the position we were in last summer, reasonable people such as ourselves worried that the euro would break up.  Thank God such discussions have come to an end due to the interventions by Governor Draghi of the European Central Bank and those of our Government and other governments across Europe.  As Deputy Byrne rightly pointed out, however, we took that for granted when it happened.  We must acknowledge that lack of confidence in the euro so that we never take it for granted.  We need to ensure we do not end up again in the dark days of the past.  I remember when my constituents contacted me to ask where they should put their money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900009#H00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379599800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Silver or gold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013091900010#J00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1379599800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Yes, and I would tell them to buy silver or gold or the dollar or sterling.

When things do not go so well we also need to be honest.  The semester process which will start soon for our country in a different way as we plan to exit our bailout programme is a very good way for us to have that discussion.  While some of us, such as Deputy Crowe, might have concerns about how it will operate, at least we need to be honest, as we all would be, about how it will operate.  We must say there are vast areas that are still exclusively areas of national competence, and also new areas of supervision and surveillance which will not apply to Ireland in their implementation if we all do the work well.

Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter such cross-border activity.  For a small open economy like Ireland that is so dependent on trade and investment with other countries, continuing to expand our network of international tax agreements is not only necessary but vital.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment by providing greater certainty to taxpayers regarding their potential liability to tax in the foreign jurisdiction; by allocating taxing rights between the two jurisdictions in order that the taxpayer is not subject to double taxation; by reducing the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes; and by ensuring taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in the foreign jurisdiction.<\/p><p>  Double taxation agreements provide benefits to both taxpayers and governments by setting out clear rules that will govern tax matters relating to cross-border trade and investment.  Tax treaties ensure predictability and fairness in the tax treatment of taxpayers and spell out clearly defined provisions that facilitate companies investing and doing business overseas.  This is achieved by allocating exclusive taxing rights to one country, or where both countries retain taxing rights, by requiring the country where the taxpayer is resident to grant credit against its tax for the tax paid in the other country.<\/p><p>  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes, which in the case of Ireland are income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  They are comprehensive in scope, covering both the taxation of companies and individuals and are in the main based on the OECD model tax convention.<\/p><p>  Apart from relieving double taxation, double taxation agreements also include provisions dealing with non-discrimination in relation to taxation matters.  They also have mutual agreement procedures which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty network compares very favourably with the networks of other larger OECD countries and now includes most of the world&rsquo;s major economies, accounting in aggregate for more than 80% of world GDP.  The Irish treaty network has grown significantly in the past three years.  We have signed comprehensive double taxation agreements with 69 countries, of which 64 are in effect.  Negotiations for a new agreement with Thailand have concluded and should be signed shortly.  The Minister for Finance and I will be ensuring we continue to prioritise the further expansion of our tax treaty network over the coming months as a central element of our integrated strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery for Ireland.<\/p><p>  I assure members that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to liaise with business representative bodies in identifying other countries where tax agreements would assist Irish business.  Of course, despite our best efforts, there are some key jurisdictions that we have yet to secure and we will continue all diplomatic efforts to bring these countries to the negotiating table.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with tax information exchange agreements.  Tax information exchange agreements, while serving a different purpose, are also important international agreements which strengthen the ability of the revenue authorities in both countries to enforce their tax laws and thereby encourage the development of closer economic relations between both countries in the future.  We have concluded tax information exchange agreements with 22 jurisdictions, 17 of which are in effect.  All of these are based on the OECD model TIEA.  The model TIEA grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally.  The OECD model TIEA represents the international standard for effective exchange of information in tax matters.  There has been a significant acceleration of the process of signing TIEAs between OECD countries and offshore jurisdictions over the past couple of years, mainly stemming from a threat by the G20 to blacklist jurisdictions that do not conclude at least 12 information exchange agreements.<\/p><p>  The TIEAs will allow the Revenue Commissioners to directly request from foreign tax authorities information that is relevant to an Irish tax investigation, such as bank account information or company or trust ownership information.  The agreements will greatly assist the Revenue Commissioners in tax investigations involving entities and bank accounts located in these jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consideration by the committee of these international agreements is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 September 2013, in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make the orders.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for its consideration.  After consideration by the committee the draft orders will be referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval, after which the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a Schedule to the Tax Acts by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  Thereupon, the Irish ratification procedures are completed.  In the case of the bilateral agreements, as soon as both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry into force provisions.<\/p><p>  I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, I will be happy to deal with any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013091900003#B00100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1379581200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending the committee.

The latter deal with specific information that is sought from time to time whereas double taxation agreements are more comprehensive.  It is important to note, in light of recent commentary both internationally and at home, that we are beginning to move to a new process of automatic exchange of information, similar to what the United States has been putting in place by way of its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, which I spoke to the finance committee about some months ago.  I had the opportunity to meet the Secretary General of the OECD, Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a, in Vilnius last week when he gave a presentation to the ECOFIN meeting.  The direction in which the G20 and OECD are moving on this issue is clear.<\/p><p>  The main benefit of automatic exchange agreements is that rather than merely an arrangement where either tax authority will respond to a specific query that the other might have, there is instead a direct and automatic exchange of all relevant information between individuals and companies, such as, for example, between the United States Internal Revenue Service and our Revenue Commissioners and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

It is quite often the case, for instance, that negotiations will commence but not conclude, which is a real problem in the case of our engagement with certain emerging economies.  I have made that point to the finance committee in the past.  There are countries in South America, in particular, with which we would like to secure an agreement but, for all types of reasons, we have not yet managed to bring discussions to a conclusion.

The logical outcome probably would be a DTA, but the reality is that DTAs often come about largely as a consequence of pressure from businesses which are doing substantial business in a third country and wish to avail of the benefits of a double taxation agreement with it.

As I stated in Vilnius last week, that will require a new gold standard which must be agreed by the OECD and internationally.  The British are moving on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013091900005#D00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1379582400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013091900005#D00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1379582400,"counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013091900005#D01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1379582400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Under Standing Order 87 the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<blockquote><br \/>The Select Sub-Committee on Finance has completed its consideration of the following motion:<br \/>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Orders in draft:<br \/>(i) Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Ukraine) Order 2013, and<br \/>(ii) Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes and Tax Matters (Dominica) Order 2013,<\/blockquote>copies of which have been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12th September, 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013091900005#D01100","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1379582400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The select-sub committee adjourned at 10.35 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 23 October 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
