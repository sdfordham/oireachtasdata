The Minister for Education and Skills must speak in the Seanad at 4.45 p.m.  Unfortunately, Senators from this committee will have to pop into the Seanad to make their contributions.  They have assured us that this meeting will take precedence and that they will come straight back to hear all of the evidence today.<\/p><p>On behalf of the committee I sincerely welcome the witnesses.  We have Mr. Paul King, lecturer and programme chair, school of human development, Dublin City University.  He brings a world of experience and research to today's topic.  We also have Mr. Shane Martin who is a brother of our esteemed colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I was fortunate to attend his book launch on this area.  We are delighted to have him with us to share his expertise and research.  We also have Dr. Tony Bates, the founder of Jigsaw, the national centre for youth mental health.  In my teaching days I was fortunate to listen and learn from him.  A survey I conducted with a number of schools in my constituency revealed that they found the Jigsaw programme to be excellent in terms of promoting positive mental health.  Last but not least, we have Mr. Peter Hussey, who is a good personal friend of mine.  I have seen a lot of his tremendous work in this area.  He is the artistic director of the Crooked House Theatre Company.  He does a lot of work in this area with young people from all different age groups.  He lectures in theatre studies in Maynooth University.  He has done a lot of improvisation work with young people to help them deal with issues that can impact on their mental health.  Yesterday I read an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Keith Walsh, who is a DJ .  He said that if he could change one thing in education then it would be to have drama encouraged more as it would give young people a lot more confidence to deal with issues.  It is very exciting to have these expert witnesses present.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the visitors in the Public Gallery.  I welcome Mr. Caol&aacute;n Dundon, Mr. Elliot Nolan, Ms &Eacute;adaoin Barrett and Mr. Jerry Chikwe-Iwu from the Crooked House Theatre Company and Ms Carmel Daly from Jigsaw.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that the opening submissions and statements they have provided to us will be published on the committee website this afternoon.  <\/p><p>Members are reminded of the same long-standing parliamentary practice.  <\/p><p>I call on Mr. King to make his opening statement.  He will be followed by the other witnesses in the order of seating.  I propose that we take statements from the four witnesses and then members will have an opportunity to ask questions.  Mr. Hussey has a PowerPoint presentation.  When we reach it, the committee secretariat will ensure that the equipment he needs is in working order.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#C00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487692800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend here today.  I am grateful for the opportunity to address this significant and crucial aspect of positive mental health in schools.<\/p> <p>  It is a positive and welcome development that despite the prevalence of mental health issues in society, over the past number of years there has been a greater appreciation of mental health being an important issue for young people.  Quite a considerable amount of evidence has been gathered over the past 30 years that tells us what works and what is helpful in assisting young people to manage and work through issues of mental health.  That is all welcome.  The impact of some interventions includes, for example, the impact it has on the academic learning of students, staff well-being, pupil well-being and the development of what one might call social and emotional skills among young people, as well as improving what might be called a risk behaviour and helping young people to deal with mental health problems.  All of that is very welcome because sometimes we can be quite negative and regressive in terms of wondering whether we have moved or advanced.  It is not all regressive and, in fact, we are heading in the general right direction.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make two principal points.  First, there is a temptation to believe that promoting and encouraging positive responses to mental health might be met through the application of curriculum reform, measures and interventions, all of which are really important.<\/p><p>However, notwithstanding the value of formal curricular interventions, the recently published guidelines on well-being for both primary and second level schools and the recent guidelines for well-being in junior cycle foreground the presence of culture, ethos and environment in promoting a dynamic, optimal development.  Such a relationship is at the heart of this and my colleague in DCU, Dr. Maeve O'Brien, talks about the care ethic principle in this regard.  We need to hold in our minds that while we can advance many positive initiatives, at the heart of the issue is promoting, encouraging and developing the experience of positive relationships for young people.  It involves learning about well-being but it is also for well-being.<\/p><p> I welcome the work of the national task force on youth mental health, which brought together a number of bodies with an interest in this area, but educators on the ground might not know what is happening so we need to make the work more cohesive and integrate it into the experience of students and teachers.  I recommend a national forum specifically dedicated to the mental health of young people, not to replace the existing national task force but to have the specific purpose of working with teachers at primary and secondary level.<\/p><p> Teachers are saying they know what to do and how to go about it but the challenge for many educators is time.  A whole-school approach is now a core aspect of mental health and this needs sufficient allocated time, particularly at second level because primary school teachers have the advantage of having one class and they know their students well.  Second level is more disjointed so it would be positive to formally allocate time for people with real passion and interest and who can support a directive, a strategy and a proactive response to working with students to promote a positive mental health culture in schools.<\/p><p> A lot of interventions are targeted towards young people and these can be very effective but teachers often have a sense of feeling inadequate and, while they wish to embrace the important issue of mental health, they also feel a lack of capacity at times.  It is important to work with teachers and encourage their desire to work with young people to enhance their development.  We also need to give teachers support because there is an expectation that teachers can be caring experts in school but that is not the case.  They need support.  There may be a need for specialised interventions, such as guidance counsellors and mental health professionals, but there is a need for specialised support in some sectors and Dr. Tony Bates of Jigsaw provides some of this.  I am not sure we have enough to deal with the plethora of issues facing schools.  Perhaps a feasible solution is to designate a team of mental health professionals within a region to respond to the needs of all its schools, rather than every school having a professional mental health practitioner.<\/p><p> I welcome the targeted programmes and interventions but I am concerned that some of the interventions tend to be imported from other cultures and communities.  They have a great richness and evidence-based practice behind them but there might be some merit in looking at what we can do within our own cultural experience.  We are somewhat behind other countries in terms of cultural mix, development and growth and we need to respect the fact that we operate at a different pace.  Our mindfulness programmes come from different countries such as the UK, America and Australia and there might be an opportunity to cultivate similar programmes from an Irish context, which would be equally respectful of diversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. King and I am particularly grateful for his recommendations because it is always very useful to discuss specific interventions.

Go raibh maith agaibh, ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, don chuireadh.  I am a former secondary school teacher and the first 13 years of my working life was in school.  I had an Irish and history degree and ended up in special education for nine years.  I moved on to psychology and, after qualifying from Jordanstown, I worked with adults with mental health difficulties with the national training and development institute, which is now the national area network.  When I studied psychology in Belfast I had noble aspirations to help those who became unwell but that job placed me in the town in which I lived and that was life changing, as I discovered there was no group that needed to be attended to as such.  Instead, all of us need to stay well.  I had my first past pupil as a psychologist by Christmas of the same year and it took about two years to reach a level of competence, as with any new job, after which I began to wonder whether psychology came in too late.<\/p> <p>  We always have to reach out and help people who have symptoms and offer them pathways to well-being and happiness with evidence-based strategies.  I told people what was wrong with them, what caused it and what to do next.  As one grows into a job one discovers there are different ways of approaching it.  I often look back on my teaching career and see that there is sometimes an obsession with mental illness.  While we need competence and compassion, I often wonder if we have failed to sow the seeds of mental wellness within schools.  We give a huge chunk of our life to education and primary and secondary education, in particular, can either be a very positive or a very negative experience for children.  A lot of students left school without the toolbox to cope when things go wrong.  Life will challenge us, we do not have control over everything and things will happen that we do not necessarily want to happen.<\/p><p>I began to think it would be lovely to merge my skills as a teacher with my knowledge base as a psychologist to reach out and harness resiliency in communities in Ireland.  As a consequence, I was asked to speak in schools and I have spoken in many schools.  As a former teacher, I know I could probably never return to teaching because it is a different job from the one I left.  I know teachers are expressing a sense of overload because there has been so much change and there is now so much accountability.  When I was teaching, there was no such thing as an inspection and there were no lesson plans.  Teachers are under serious pressure.  Many of them feel their job circumstances are posing challenges for their mental wellness.<\/p><p> There is massive scope to harness a culture of resiliency within schools.  I am aware that simple things can make a significant difference.  The teachers in our schools probably do not know that the wonderful evidence-based things they are doing are making a meaningful difference.  It is wonderful that the establishment of well-being teams has been promised as part of the new junior certificate programme.  The pastoral care teams that are in most schools do powerful work to reach out.  The teacher in a mainstream school who has primary responsibility for learning difficulties or special education might be perceived as the only person who deals with that area, but the truth is that every single interaction between every teacher and every child in that school is critical.  Science now knows more about those who survive crises.  I have counselled past pupils who achieved great results in the leaving certificate but crumbled to pieces when they faced their first crisis in university or the workplace.  We need to think outside the box when it comes to our young people.  We need to be resourceful in how we engage with them about their mental health.  Schools need to empower their students with a toolbox for coping during the inevitable crises and challenges of life.<\/p><p> In recent decades, psychologists throughout the world have learned more about resilient people who thrive despite adversity, achieve positive outcomes despite setbacks and misfortune, and sustain their health during testing times.  Within a few years of taking up my position as a psychologist with the national learning network, it started to dawn on me that I needed to consider whether this research could help us to develop initiatives that could foster resilience in school communities.  One sometimes hears people saying positive and well-intentioned things.  Someone recently suggested to me that we need to bring resilience into schools as soon as possible.  The reality is that resilience is not a module within a course or a subject in its own right.  A school can cultivate an ethos or culture of resilience by taking a whole-school approach to it.  I have done a great deal of work with principals and deputy principals throughout the country because I know there is a critical need to make school management aware of evidence-based approaches and initiatives.  We sometimes make the mistake of assuming a targeted group needs resilience.  When schools are preparing sixth class primary school pupils, they should not focus exclusively on children who are in difficulty.  I would never want that to happen because it assumes not only that such children need this help, but also that children getting ready for first year in secondary school who come from happy homes that give them a sense of security will always achieve greatness and positive outcomes in schools.  The reality is that all children need resilience skills.  A whole-school approach is needed.<\/p><p> Our research indicates that four key areas make a critical difference to ensuring the desired outcomes are more likely to occur.  The first of these areas relates to caring relationships.  In some cases, the teacher is the critical person who is beside the child during a difficult time, who believes in him or her and who gives him or her a sense of belief and self-esteem.  This is happening, perhaps indirectly, in schools.  All teachers need to know they have the potential to offer this form of support to all students.  UCD research on the concept of a \"significant adult\" has shown that if parenting is weak or non-existent, tragedy has struck a home or a child has learning difficulties and feels hopeless, it makes a considerable difference to the child if he or she can interact with a teacher who cares for him or her.<\/p><p> Our research also shows that better outcomes can be achieved if teachers and schools have expectations for all students.  There can be an obsession with academic brilliance.  Schools tend to be adjudicated within their own communities by the results they get.  As I suggested earlier, some children who achieve greatness in the leaving certificate by getting well over 500 points crumble to pieces when they face their first crisis in their first term in university.  We need to ensure there are high standards of academic brilliance.  All children should be stretched to their capacity in terms of their intellectual ability.  A teacher in a school who shows the same passion and interest in someone achieving 200 points in the leaving certificate is making as important an intervention as a teacher who encourages someone who is taking seven honours subjects in the leaving certificate with the aim of getting more than 500 points.  Children and particularly teenagers are intelligent because they notice very quickly if other students are receiving more attention.  I am not saying that happens in general, but it can happen indirectly.  We nearly need to legislate within a school community to ensure all children receive feedback about how they are doing and how close they are to the targets they set for themselves.<\/p><p> The third vital area shown by our research is the need for opportunities for participation.  Many children who come from unhappy homes or have had trauma in the past can shine in school.  It is important for teachers to understand that all children must be allowed avenues to tap into their own talents and strengths within the school community.  Sometimes schools make the mistake of appointing leaders as prefects.  Maybe they should be teaching leadership to everyone, thereby allowing every student to be open to the concept of leadership.  It is important to allow all children to shine, for example in school concerts.  There might be students who have talent in art but are not doing art.  Students with musical talent might be studying physics instead of music.  It is possible that the greatest failing of education is that we are sometimes more obsessed with deficits, disadvantages and disorders than we are with strengths.  Some schools in America are formally assessing children for strengths at intake to ascertain what they are uniquely brilliant at and to give them opportunities to shine in those areas and feel involved in their school communities.<\/p><p> The fourth key area revealed by our research is social connectivity.  There have been massive changes in that regard in recent times.  I often feel that even though houses are closer to each other than in previous times, people have never been further apart.  There can be children on the same road who do not know each other's names because of the different avenues for social connection that now exist.  I refer, for example, to the revolution that has taken place in social media.  The point I want to make about social connection is that the more friends young people have, the better.  It is a critical skill.<\/p><p>I have often said that sometimes the greatest friend of depression is solitude.  One does not have to live alone to experience solitude, one detaches oneself from the people with whom one is living.  How many families sit around a table anymore and hear each other's stories of the day?  Schools have to initiate attempts to connect children to their community, in particular, and allow them opportunities to volunteer in their communities and to participate at all levels within the school community.  Even those who appear to be reluctant at the beginning can sometimes shine when given trial periods of responsibility and become hungry for more of it when they realise they have that capacity.<\/p><p> I have made a number of recommendations, which I will not outline in detail now.  The main one, and I am passionate about it, is that the wonderful teachers in our wonderful schools do not necessarily have to become experts in psychology to make a difference.  They do not have to take on extra courses or more work on top of the work they already do, but they must be affirmed in terms of the science that shows that certain interventions which are taking place in school by certain teachers or interventions that all teachers can become involved in make a difference to more children in the schools.  I would love resilience to be a core module within the teaching qualification at primary and secondary level and to see professional development around the unique culture that is necessary to ensure that resilience is more likely to be fostered.  The good news is that very simple things make a huge difference in a world that has become far too complicated.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to mention some of the matters about which I am passionate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Martin.

I will focus my thoughts on the problem of fear.  Fear is pervasive in our schools, both among significant numbers of students and among teachers.  I will propose three simple, but revolutionary, ways that I believe will reduce fear.<\/p> <p>  I will first talk about students.  In 2012, we did the My World Survey with 700 school-going students aged from 12 to 18 years.  Anxiety was very high among one in three of them.  It was much higher than expected and higher than depression, anger, stress and other issues.  A teacher in Tramore recently told me that in the last ten years each cohort of students she has seen has been more and more anxious, one more than the last.  Interestingly, she said they were more anxious about smaller things, as though they have lost a capacity to deal with some of the issues.  There are very real reasons that they are afraid.  Certainly, in Jigsaw we see fear as the major reason for anxiety.  It is fear that they are not good enough, do not have what it takes, that they will let us down and that failure they have experienced in the past will be their experience yet again and it is only a matter of time.  They are on tenterhooks.  They bring all of that fear packed in their backpacks every morning, so it is hard to learn and pay attention.  When they do not learn and they fail at school, that further reinforces a sense of not being good enough and it appears to reinforce the thing of which they are most afraid.  This leads to drop-out.  It leads to a great deal of attention-seeking and distracting and disruptive behaviour.  It also can have a very negative impact on their colleagues in the classroom.  That is the student sphere.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the fear in teachers, many of the problems in society are landed at the doors of schools and teachers are expected to pick them up.  We expect a great deal of them.  The reality is that they are ordinary people doing an extraordinary job, but with very little support and particularly around mental health issues.  We have given them a great deal more responsibility and autonomy in this area, but we have not backed it up with the supports they need in terms of their confidence, their abilities to engage on these issues and the supports they need from outside that can surround the school and bring some measure of comfort to teachers that when somebody is at risk they know there is a pathway to care for that person.<\/p> <p>  We found that teachers are afraid.  In the past year I have visited many schools and listened to many teachers.  The most common word I have heard is \"spooked\".  They are quite spooked by certain behaviour such as self-harm and suicide across school populations and terrified that if they engage with something they might inadvertently make it worse, or that the person might then do something terrible and they would feel responsible.  I was in a school last week where there has been a suicide.  The teachers feel quite shattered and more afraid of all the remaining students.  That has a very contagious effect on them.<\/p> <p>  I should also mention that while schools can be very frightening places for students and even teachers, they can also be immensely protective places for mental health.  This is perhaps the strongest argument for building more capacity in schools.  Young people coming from painfully toxic family situations can find a different experience of themselves in schools.  They can take on a new identity where they are believed in and encouraged in what they are good and best at in their lives.  That is a remarkable gift of schools.<\/p> <p>  With regard to fear, let us think about how fear is reduced.  It is a practical problem for any of us.  It is reduced when there is, first, some safety - it can be a person or a place - where we are allowed to express that fear.  For most people, we are allowed to articulate it.  However, we can also be allowed to express fear in art and in theatre.  Then, and this is important, we are allowed to hold it in mind.  We are allowed to sit with it and think about it, until some creative and meaningful insight comes about what we can do next.  Young people need that from teachers but a teacher cannot offer that unless they are feeling somewhat calm and safe, and they cannot feel calm and safe until they have a means to be held and supported by each other or by people who might work with the teachers to give them an opportunity to talk these things through.  Teachers do not so much need solutions as they need opportunities to think about what is happening in their school at the time.  They are very creative people.  When they are given those opportunities solutions emerge that none of us could think of and that are not written in books, because they are bespoke solutions for that child or school.  I have seen this many times and can give examples if asked.<\/p> <p>  For the last couple of years Jigsaw has been working on a notion of a listening school, a school where it becomes possible to listen to all the voices and all the players so we begin to get a sense of what is happening in the school with the students and we begin collectively to take ownership of this and work out what to do.  We have worked in several schools in Meath and the work in Meath was part of an Oireachtas report some years ago.  The committee asked for recommendations, so I will discuss what I would like to see happening and what we would propose to make happen.  We have all articulated concerns about schools and particularly about the role of teachers, who are the carriers of change.  Government may instigate change but teachers will carry that change.  They must feel ownership and confident.  However, what is their experience and how capable do they feel around mental health?  What is helping them and what is not helping them?  We do not know this.  All of us have informed opinions and anecdotes, but we do not really know.  It would be interesting to think of how to gather that data in a nuanced way.  We have some thoughts about that which I can refer back to.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that if what teachers need most are opportunities to think through what is happening in their experience with students, how can we create time and shared learning opportunities for them to come together?<\/p><p>That may be done by bringing together clusters of five or eight schools.  I have held many teacher meetings, with anything from ten to 80 participants, where people take time to think through what is happening in our schools.  Sadly, they are often held in the wake of suicide and it is part of a debriefing but those moments allow people hear each other speak about what they want for their school.  There is a great opportunity through communities of practice to have teachers take ownership and learn from each other, as well as learn from us.<\/p><p> Finally, it is to bring services closer to the school.  We do that but teachers need to know there is a safety net for them and for their students when issues emerge that clearly indicate that a person is at risk.  It can be a nightmare at 5 o'clock on a Friday evening when they are just about to go home and something comes up or 12 noon on a Tuesday when they do not know where to turn.  We need to mobilise those services to support them and not leave it all to them.<\/p><p> Our vision for schools is to improve the health of schools to ensure they are healthy, not unhealthy, places and that there is a change of ownership throughout the entire school.  That requires listening to students.  I did not say enough that one of the aspects central to all our work in schools is to have the student voice, and we have young people here today, spoken in key meetings in schools.  It is both calming for teachers because they hear what is going on and their great fear is that they are not picking up what is happening, but also in terms of the creativity of students.  Whether it is through student councils or peer mentoring, these are fabulous ways to get young people involved.  Generally, there needs to be an ownership around that.  There needs to be enhanced collaboration between schools and agencies, more capacity given to teachers and active engagement young people.  It is about fear and us listening to what is happening, and creating opportunities for teachers and students to listen to themselves and each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Bates","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bates for his thought provoking contribution.

This is one sliver of an approach that, in my experience, works in developing resilience.  I introduce it to the members because I believe it is timely in light of junior cycle reforms where drama is introduced into the secondary school curriculum and where it is possible it will be introduced in the future at senior cycle.  The approach I refer to involves youth theatre, which is very different from speech and drama, musical theatre or stage school.  It is a unique type of work, and we are one of many youth theatres in the country that works in this area.  We are all under the umbrella of an organisation called Youth Theatre Ireland, which was formally the National Association of Youth Drama, based here in Dublin.  It is an amazing organisation that supports youth teachers with training, provides opportunities for young people to become involved and works with people to become facilitators of drama during their period of training with a programme called ArtsTrain.<\/p> <p>  To take up on what Dr. Bates said, in the past ten years I have found a change in the people who come to our youth theatre.  They have moved from being eccentric and outgoing to people who are shy.  We are seeing more shy people.  A huge number of young people who have anxiety present to us, perhaps by their parents or on the recommendation of their teacher to come to the youth theatre.  That profile of person has greatly increased.  It is mostly the case with young males but also with females.  That peaked my interest, largely because I wondered why somebody would consider that drama would be a place for somebody with anxiety yet, instinctively, I knew the reason.  I began research and I am now researching a PhD in Maynooth on examining why that might be the case and whether this art form develops that particular resilience.  I have paid a good deal of attention to my work and to the opinions of the young people and the research spoken about.  Much of what I will talk about is based on the findings of that research.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would make is that we are not like school in that groups come together in ensembles and stay together for a long time.  Their decision to be part of the ensemble is their own and the length of time as part of the ensemble is however long it lasts.  There is no set time on it.  Usually, it is between four and five years so there could be a number of these ensembles in a youth theatre at any one time.<\/p> <p>  It is not like school in that the learning material as to what will happen, and a lot happens, is not set out in advance in the youth theatre over the course of someone's one or two years in it.  They do not know what will be involved but they do know will probably be fun and creative in some way.  It is not broken into modules in the way it is done in second level, for example, where there might be a module in the Stanislavski method or in physical acting.  It is integrated throughout performance, rehearsal and workshop.  Strict attendance is not adhered to.  There are no registers other than for child protection reasons and nobody is punished or otherwise about attendance.  That kind of environment does not exist, nor is there any benign propaganda.  By that I mean that nobody will tell the young person that this will be good for them and that they should take part in it.  There are no known conclusions.  For example, if we start a project we do not know that it will be about how bad drugs are for them, which is benign propaganda.  It is true but it is not a conclusion people know before they start the project.  They do not know what they will learn or discover as they undertake the project.  Instead, there is a kind of pedagogy of surprise, which is based on what I have been looking at and reading about as part of my research.  Most people who come in do not know what will happen next month but they know it will be good and that there is an opportunity for the quality and ambition of the work to be good or at a high level.  They do not know how they will learn or what they will learn until they discover it themselves.  We are providing a space for them to discover this learning about themselves, the world and social systems through the actual process itself.  Nothing is set out or flagged in advance.<\/p> <p>  The young people discover that being flexible is a huge skill so they can take up invitations such as this one to come before the committee at reasonably short notice.  To present here, make presentations or do performances in a matter of weeks at various places and so on they must be flexible.  They know the learning programme may change radically from one year to another depending on who comes into it or whose needs are being met.  Overall, we get a sense that it is about creating adventures.  Youth theatre is about creating adventures in learning with young people, and they are very much directors and owners of that.  They determine the rate, the pace and the nature of the learning that goes on but primarily they learn unexpectedly; it is learning by surprise.  They learn by doing something and reflecting back on it.  In that way they realise they did not know that about themselves or that they had no idea how something worked in society until they did the show or went through the process.  All of that motivates attendance and generates engagements.  Those are the two major aspects that are behind the idea of building resilience.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we discovered from my research and also from informal interviews that approximately 75% of our young men and 54% of our young women revealed that they have generalised anxiety disorder.  A huge number of them attributed that to events in school.  That is not to say that they all see school as a negative place because, as was said correctly earlier, most find a level of enjoyment at school but parts of the school programme trigger the anxiety.<\/p><p>It often has a lot to do with each other in terms of bullying for example.  That is well known and well researched at this stage.<\/p><p> What school does not offer, however, and what this pedagogy of surprise seems to offer is what we call \"an aesthetic engagement\".  That is completely missing from their lives.  An aesthetic engagement is, in a way, a counteractive to everything else that is going on.  It is basically the opposite of an anaesthetic engagement where they are anaesthetised in every other part of their lives.  Aesthetic engagement involves four things; emotion, intellect, body and imagination working at exactly the same time.  It is very hard working.  One does not put oneself through that every part of one's day because it exhausts one.  In the research, people are saying to me, in particular young men, that when they come into the theatre programme, they forget about the stress for a brief period or about the anxiety.  They are so in the moment that it is sort of an act of mindfulness.  In the moment, they are making work that involves all those four things and does not focus on just one, which school does at certain times.  They leave the space refreshed.  It is a sort of oasis for them to escape what is going on.  The anxiety comes back when they go down the stairs or go out into the street and it comes back later on.<\/p><p> However, three of four people said interesting things to me.  They said they were so attracted to this that they started to look for other opportunities and began to take part more and more in the youth theatre.  Over a period of time, they began to experience different types of mental process.  My research and cognitive neuroscience, in particular, look at what happens to the brain of an actor and a young person when we do collaborative theatre and shows that all of these hormones and drugs cascade through the system when one is involved in an aesthetic engagement.  Cortisone is usually there when one is not but just has anxiety and stress.  That damages the brain in the long term.  Adrenalin is there as is serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin, which is really significant because it encourages them to feel that people want to love them.  After a performance, there is a huge coming down because one is really recovering from the dose one has just got of everything I mentioned.  Eventually, young people find that their neural pathways are repatterned.  They lay down new connectors and habits of being which is one thing that happens without them ever thinking about mental health.  It is just from engaging in this kind of collaborative creative activity.<\/p><p> Performances are about a range of issues.  They are not flagged in the sense of saying we are now going to make a performance about mental health or well-being.  It is an open place where their issues are developed and performances come out of them, such as this one, which was about school and the issues they felt about it.  That is why I agreed with Dr. Bates when he said this was when they were expressing their fear, held it and made something out of it.  That was one a few years ago.  Other ones are about how they respond to themselves as performance images.  That is, when they are performing, the different facets they play using dialogue and scripts to make small talk.  The act of being in a theatre itself helps them to understand the different roles they play, including backstage or using costumes and so on.  Crucially, they have to understand how to be looked at as everybody in this room needs at some point to understand that one is looked at as a public figure making public speeches.  I am sure nobody teaches the members that they have to feel how it is when people are staring at them quietly, assessing them as they speak.  That is a huge thing for teachers but also for performers.  It is the main part of the training we are giving them.  It is about what goes on in one's body when that happens.<\/p><p> Other work looks at how one can use the stress one feels to create excitement about one's performance or an opportunity coming towards one.  Using stress rather than misusing it is a key attribute.  They also look at relationships and the society around them.  Some theatre is made on their issues so \"Indigo\" was made before the marriage equality referendum two years ago as a piece to explore their reaction to it.  Even though none of them were old enough to vote, they wanted people hear what they had to say.  They explore concepts of gender and beauty which are also themes that come from them around how society makes young men and women.  This was reflected in a production called \"Flawless\" which we brought to France.  Other people work with us to do research, including Sarah Meaney who is currently making a PhD on how some schools ease out those who do not belong.  She says that, in a sense, no one is expelled anymore.  They are neglected or pushed to the side.  Her thesis is \"Dropped Out or Kicked Out?\" and she uses our actors and their experience in schools to dramatise the stories of those who have had this experience.  Our young people understand what the process is about by doing that.<\/p><p> Our most recent piece is \"Venetians\" which was two weeks ago and in which we looked at migration.  They are really affected by the issues around migration and want to explore that.  In so doing, they are not just looking at the stories of people from Libya or our new communities who are in the youth theatre, but looking also at those who have left Ireland and who are older members of they youth theatre.  Some send back monologues saying what it is like in Australia and why they will not come back.  Some who have come back have said why they were going to.  They are also looking at the theory of migration and this idea of a desire for a better place, to live elsewhere and for a better state of being.  They look at aspects like personal relationships and how our relationships are about power.  They consider how teacher-student relationships are about power and how space around them, like this space, works in terms of status and power.  That will not have escaped them, in a sense.  Neither will the school place where they are learning.  They find themselves quite passive in that environment where the teachers are the active ones doing all the doing while they do all the receiving.  That comes out in their exploration of power based on personal relationships.  As such, the collaboration they do is risky because mostly today education is driving us further and further towards an individual engagement with material and an individual reflection on it rather than towards working in a team or group where one has to take risks.  I think this is one of the big aspects of school and I hear my colleagues say the same thing.  One just does not know what the outcome will be when one is working with other people.  One does not know how it is going to end.  One has to take risks about making decisions about he outcome.<\/p><p> They understand how to use failure.  All theatre is about failure.  We could not possibly rehearse if we knew it was going to be perfect.  Nobody is going to get a script and say \"Learn the lines and we will do this show on Sunday\".  One has to rehearse in order to see what can go wrong and use that as the basis for one's work.  Theatre helps them defer gratification and this is one of those skills that build up resilience.  It is about working and planning today to have a major reward after one has put in a great deal of work.  Another notion being discussed is the idea of progression.  Many people with anxiety and depression feel stuck but when they compare what they are doing in theatre and how they are learning, they can see the progression they are taking.  This is not a thing that holds them back.  Rather, it means they can apply it to their lives.  Using information is a big one.  I believe that in school they are mostly encouraged to ask for permission to do things rather than to use information.  It is not only in school but outside.  They need permission to speak or to be somebody.  That concept of having to ask for permission before one can act is alien to theatre and would not produce any kind of theatre if it were implemented.  Instead, one has to use all the information around one.  One must read groups or individuals and their intentions.  One must read other actors, see where power is happening and what is likely to happen and act on that.  One commits to action based on one's use of information.  It is a massive change in their way of thinking and it is the key for our young people in developing resilience rather than passively being overwhelmed by information, stuck or internalising it or not having the agency to deal with it.<\/p><p> Finally, managing impulses is another major one for collaborative drama.<\/p><p>One must channel those impulses into something creative, rather than turning them inwards and repressing one's desire to speak.  One must also control over-reactions to things or people will say that one is over-acting and that the performance is bad.  One learns to manage how one deals with situations of crisis.  Finally, managing impulses is not just about calming people down.  It is also about encouraging them to speak up.  If one has an impulse that something is wrong and one wants to sedate it, one can do that in the drama process.  Otherwise, it is very flat and boring.  <\/p><p> Love, family and belonging are the traditional values that people associate with a youth theatre which is an intensely creative and collaborative experience.  Belonging to a group is very important.  One young person spoke about being secretly suicidal and planning his suicide until his first show, when he got a round of applause.  He did not think anything of it until he got that round of applause.  He felt that if the audience, who did not know him, applauded what he was doing then it was a short enough step for him to appreciate the person doing it, namely, himself.  That changed his life.  <\/p><p> In terms of recommendations, first we must continue to support youth theatre provision in this country through Youth Theatre Ireland.  Ours is one of the few youth theatres that is funded regularly by our local authority, which is marvellous.  That shows a huge understanding of and investment in youth theatre.  We also need to look at the CAO system rather than schools themselves because a lot of stress on young people comes from the expectations around points.  We must examine the requirements for entry to university and consider the inclusion of things like involvement in youth theatre.  A controlled, monitored and possibly assessed involvement in a youth theatre programme run by Youth Theatre Ireland for a year, for example, could yield a certain number of points for young people.  That could be implemented fairly easily and would encourage participation by young people.  <\/p><p> In terms of the provision of drama at second level, there is a notion that drama can be taught by anyone but we would never accept that concept in terms of music or art, for example.  We would not accept that a physical education teacher could teach music or that a maths teacher could teach art.  Drama is a discipline that requires an enormous amount of practice, skill and training.  To do it right, to bring about all of the outcomes about which I spoke, requires trained pedagogues.  To do it wrong creates exactly the opposite outcome.  It furthers the stress and increases the torture that young people feel, if they are in the wrong environment and made to perform without any preparation.  We all have memories, from a very young age, of having to stand up and sing something when we were not ready.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hussey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Hussey.  I am just thinking of the stress we were all under less than 12 months ago in the context of the general election.  We spoke to so many different audiences and groups.  One such audience stands out for me.  Kildare Youth Theatre brought together all of the candidates from all parties and none and really grilled us.  I was so full of respect and admiration for the young people involved, in terms of their honesty and integrity.  It was very clear that they had come through a process that made them confident about putting their arguments forward.  A great service was done by bringing those young people together and informing them about all of the issues related to elections, civic dialogue, civil society and so on and then affording all of the candidates the opportunity to interact with them.  It was tough, I must say, but well worth doing.<\/p> <p>  Before I go to members, I must say that the four contributions this afternoon were absolutely fascinating.  We have all learned a lot.  It is great to have really strong recommendations that we can bring forward.  There was a great deal of commonality in the contributions from witnesses.  When the phrase \"exciting chord\" was used I was thinking of teachers facing 35 or 36 students and trying to create adventures in learning.  That is so important but so difficult to do.<\/p> <p>  I am a former teacher, as are Deputies Carol Nolan and Catherine Martin.  In terms of curriculum development, particularly at second level, far too much time is focused on acquiring information rather than learning key skills to enable students to navigate the world.  As all of the witnesses have said, the skills of critical and creative thinking, processing information and working with others are absolutely essential to enable young people to navigate their way in the world and to prepare them for life, not just for employment opportunities.  Far too often, the emphasis in schools is on getting points, going out into the world, getting a job and becoming an economic unit within society.  The emphasis must be on far more than that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the tough job that teachers have, the overwhelming emphasis on points for third level and students scoring high in the State examinations, is not supportive of them.  The publication of league tables, for example, is something with which I fundamentally disagree.  It is not the teachers' fault but the focus of their work is on the provision of information.  For the student, the focus is on the retention of that information.  Our teachers face enormous demands and we need to do more to identify and support great teaching.  That point was made clear in all of the contributions in terms of how we need to support teachers and students, both inside and outside the classroom.  We need to involve the whole community in order to achieve greater social integration and to deal with the various issues that arise.  Over 2,000 years ago Aristotle celebrated education as \"an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity\".  We are certainly going through a crisis now, not just in Ireland but around the world, and education can be an agent of renewal in terms of how we go forward.  <\/p> <p>  This committee must consider its role carefully in terms of what we put forward to Government.  I apologise for speaking for so long and now invite Senator Ruane to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#J00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I apologise but I am under time pressure so would be grateful if someone could give me a nod when Senator Devine starts speaking in the Seanad Chamber, at which point I will have to run.  I hope I do not leave too much out and I will catch up on the remainder of these proceedings later on.<\/p> <p>  This is an area in which I have a keen interest partly because of my own experience of school.  As a 13 year old I was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder but this was not recognised at school.  I would like to read the PhD on kids who are either neglected until they leave or are expelled because that is the case for many children who pose difficulties within the classroom.  I understand that teachers are under great pressure but as a working mother, I am very conscious that schools often have more access to children than parents.  That places an enormous responsibility on teachers who are the primary care givers for children for a huge portion of the day.  The witnesses spoke about the capacity of teachers and this is an issue of huge concern.  How do we build on the capacity of teachers in order to give them the confidence to intervene when it is necessary to do so?<\/p> <p>  I made a submission to the Minister for Education and Skills in response to his action plan in the context of teacher training.  It was not focused specifically on mental health but on taking a holistic approach to education and examining the inclusive education module in the teacher training programme.  My submission mimicked Dr. Austin O'Carroll's model for doctors who work in areas of deprivation and applied that model to teachers who work in such areas, encouraging them to take a much more holistic approach to education.<\/p><p>Many of those teachers could act as mental health service providers.  Being much more understanding of the context in which they are working, they can act as a signpost and see when an issue arises.<\/p><p> A comment was made on encouraging children to work or get involved in their own community.  The difficulty I have in envisaging this coming to light is that the schools are very much dissociated from the community and have not become the centre of it in the way they should.  How do we build the relationships so that when a mental health issue arises for a child, the teacher can say he or she has a direct contact in Jigsaw or any given service?  That flat-level communication and conversation is not happening.  We can provide something in the school but if the school is not in conversation with the community and the services, we are fighting a losing battle.<\/p><p> I liked Mr. Hussey's presentation.  My daughter, who is an actor, was the lead in the film \"I Used To Live Here\", which was based on Dr. Tony Bates's article on cluster suicides.  My daughter spoke publicly at the time about how her playing that role alleviated her suicidal ideation.  Is there room for theatre providers to examine the role of role play within the school in regard to mental health?  I know my daughter's playing of the role of a suicidal child allowed her to go through the process and come out the other side with a different view.  What role could theatre play in regard to roleplay?<\/p><p> I held an event in Tallaght recently called Tallaght Talks.  It was a raw event after a cluster of suicides in the Tallaght area.  We had all the service providers there and we had the young men and women whom one usually cannot get into a room.  I developed a White Paper based on the event, which I shall publish in the next few weeks.  I will send it on to those present.  One of the main themes from the day was not the individuals experiencing mental health issues but the first responders.  With what do we need to equip schools, teachers and parents to be first responders?  This comes back to the fear of being the first responder.  What does it mean in terms of introducing material on the curriculum but not equipping teachers to be first responders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#J00300","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agaibh agat as ucht teacht anseo inniu agus cur i l&aacute;thair chomh mionsonraithe a dh&eacute;anamh.  I thank the delegates so much for their detailed presentations.  I commend them on their excellent work on children's mental health, which represents such a vital field.  I, for one, welcome that, finally in recent years, the spotlight is on our children's mental health and on placing it front and centre in education.  I have just a few questions.<\/p> <p>  Mr. King is a great advocate of mindfulness and has an excellent knowledge base.  Is he in favour of his programme being integrated into the school system or rolling it out in general?  How does he envisage this happening?  At what age should we start teaching mindfulness?  What standard of training do teachers need?  Is there a certain qualification?  Is mindfulness suited to all children or not?  Is there a danger also?  Do we have to be very careful about how mindfulness is delivered in our schools?<\/p> <p>  It is very important that schoolchildren receive support in mental health issues but sometimes the teachers are forgotten about.  How can we support our teachers?  If we are talking about positive mental health in our schools, what is the position on the whole school staff and community?  How do we encourage and ensure positive mental health among them?<\/p> <p>  At the beginning of Dr. Bates's submission, he referred to post-primary schools.  Does he work with primary schools?  If not, why?  Is it a matter of resources?  I am curious about that.<\/p> <p>  Do schools refer students for the wonderful supports that Jigsaw provides?  If so, how is it done?  Is it done by the principal, a specific teacher or guidance counsellor?  Is there any way of monitoring an identified child when they leave school, or is the child suddenly left without the supports?  Can students always access the external supports they need?  Does it vary according to the luck of the draw based on where one lives in the country?  Are there considerable waiting lists for the supports?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hussey referred to the aesthetic engagement that is not available in our schools.  Is there potential to provide that in our schools?  I think specifically of the new junior cycle and the short courses.  I have taken on board what Mr. Hussey said on the need for delivery by experts in the field.  Can short courses be designed and given in certain schools?  Should we be considering this?  The NCCA has a short course on artistic performance but does it take on board any of the expertise to which Mr. Hussey referred regarding aesthetic engagement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#K00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I commend each and every one of the delegates on their very insightful presentations.  The content was very impressive.  Dr. Bates founded Jigsaw.  We have a branch in Tullamore, in my constituency.  It is doing very well along with other mental health organisations.  What impressed me very much was the fact that there is a youth advisory panel.  The young people are leading the organisation, which is fantastic because they obviously influence their peers.  It is a very good way to structure an organisation.  I commend Dr. Bates on that.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the guidelines on mental health presented to primary schools.  Will a programme be rolled out at national level?  If so, access to counsellors will be required.  Would it be best to do that through the HSE or NEPS, which we currently have in schools?  If we introduced a positive mental health programme, would it be best to introduce a programme on its own or integrate it into the SPHE curriculum?  The latter would be ideal for a strand on a programme such as one covering mental health.  This is vital in our schools.  As a teacher, I note the need for it has increased dramatically over the past ten years.  It is something we need to be on top of, and we certainly need to have our teachers trained and prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#K00300","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I was going to ask a question similar to that of Deputy Nolan.  We have NEPS but do not really have clinical or therapeutic psychology within the education system in general.  Could that be examined?  There is obviously considerable reliance on charities and other external services and the general health services.  That could be examined.  A point in Mr. Paul King's presentation that struck me concerned curriculum time.  It is always the problem when one mentions any subject or issue.  It is always said there is not enough time.  Someone told me, \"Get rid of Irish and religion and there is time for everything\".  I do not know how time can be made available.  Theatre is Mr. Hussey's area.  There are other areas of interest that people could focus on.  Perhaps we should be considering this in a more formal informal way, if one knows what I mean, outside the school system so there would be some structures so children could be directed to practices they would like to engage in.  For many, it might be theatre.  Parents always tell Members there is nothing for children to do in their area but when one drills down, there tends to be many things.  Perhaps, however, there should be some way of connecting with the schools to direct parents to where organisations are in their area.  Crooked House is presumably very well known but there are other bodies doing similar, although perhaps less structured, work of which parents simply might not be aware.  Mr. Hussey's suggestion on the points system - I am not saying I am going to endorse it immediately - is very interesting.  I refer to extracurricular activities or the type of outside-the-school event that could relieve some of the pressure on the timetable.  It does not have to be held in a formal way.<\/p> <p>  I thank the delegates.  This is an issue I have been exploring as education spokesman.

Those working in the education area become terrified when I speak about teachers taking responsibility for, or playing a role in, mental health education.  They think they have to have a masters in psychology to deal with these issues whereas we are trying to promote well-being.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the role of teachers and school staff.  Is that the best way to address the issue?  What are the thoughts of the delegations about whether mental health education should be integrated into various subjects or taught on its own?

Is there a structure whereby teachers can recommend students to go to KYT after school?  Is there a semi-formal relationship between Jigsaw and schools?  Jigsaw does terrific work but I refer to counties that do not have a Jigsaw centre or a centre run by a similar group.  How do we go about ensuring a presence in them?

Jigsaw is a community service for young people and we decided on the 12 to 25 age bracket rather than primary age because we know that that is the most vulnerable age for the emergence of mental health difficulties.  It may not necessarily mean mental illness but it can become that.  Mental illnesses start as anxiety and depression and, without care, they grow legs.  During my 30 years in St. James's Hospital, I saw people constantly who had been through many admissions and who said, \"If only I had seen someone at the age of 14 or 15\".  Schools can play a huge role in preventing serious mental disorders.  We picked that age group because we felt that is where the system was weakest but where it needed to be strongest.  Great work is being done in early years education but youth mental health was neglected until 2006.  An organisation defines itself by what it does not do as much as by what it does.  Jigsaw offers a great deal in areas.  For example, we visited a school the other day and the manager from the Jigsaw project in Dublin city centre spoke to the staff and invited them and the students to visit the Jigsaw premises in order that young people would know where it is and that is accessible but also that Jigsaw could work in the school to help build capacity around understanding and confidence to engage with people.  There is more than going on that just seeing people but they can be seen.  They can self-refer and as one principal in Balbriggan said, the students know they can go to Jigsaw in the town and they do not have to tell the school staff or there can be a quiet word and they will go.  We have striven to remove those barriers.  There are many ways to do that with careful clinical governance and child protection measures.  Best practice is observed.<\/p> <p>  The big question is where to begin.  We have to begin with a consensus around what we would love to see happen in schools.  We have to begin at the end, which is the vision.  If we have a clear understanding of what we want to happen differently in schools, we will work to get there.  Well-being is the wave that is breaking on the shores and it is the wave we have to work with at the moment.  That is where energy, resources and money are being invested.  It is the best thinking we have around mental health.  It is funny that when we opened the Jigsaw centre in Galway, all the young people said we should not put well-being on the table.  They said to us that if people are experiencing mental health problems and challenges, we need to let them know this is where they come and we have to change what mental health means.  It is not mental illness but it is the more spiky end.  Well-being is so attractive.  Who does not want well-being?  However, mental health is when everything gets heated and that is when people need help.  We need not to be afraid of the phrase.  It is not ideal but it is not mental illness.  That is something else, which encompasses mental ill-health but it is not the same.<\/p> <p>  This has to be integrated within schools.  Somebody has to be in charge.  NEPS is the obvious body to pull together the threads.  There are so many threads that it is like a spaghetti bowl.  They are not even connected in any way; they are just all out there.  There are many different developments in schools with people moving in with solutions.  There are many magic bullets.  It is noisy and crowded and more shared thinking is needed.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the word \"mental\", we need a shared language and a way to talk about this.  I am careful and I use generalised anxiety disorder.  I am careful in so far as I can to use these words as adverbs, not nouns.  People are anxious, depressed, frightened or angry but they do not have something.  They can go on to have something but most of those we see are not there.  We need a shared language that is not frightening for people.  We all need that to be able to talk about these issues.  Well-being is a lovely framework within which to have that but we need to recognise the kids we are most concerned about are at the dark end of the spectrum and we need to have language for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Bates"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Mr. Martin must address a conference in Newry later and he may need to get away.

Some 32 of the 50 US states have school-based counselling within them, as do three of Canada's ten provinces, and one in six states in Australia.  All experts know that prevention is key and that early intervention is critical.<\/p><p> In the context of our own system, it is important to acknowledge that guidance counsellors are ideally positioned to be the drivers of the new proposed well-being teams in every school, but only if they are allowed the hours necessary to deliver this service and to sufficiently utilise their skills and competencies. <\/p><p> We might talk about what we have and whether we need more, but it is a crying shame that what we did have has been taken away or reduced.

The opportunity to attend to that comes from giving students and teachers the opportunity to trust their judgment and skill set.  Schools are wonderful environments, but may be a bit like the D&aacute;il which in some ways can be almost at one remove from society.  That is because there is a world inside the school and a world outside it also.  Mr. Hussey's work attempts to meet the needs of young people in terms of what their world is beyond school.  I am involved in teacher education training and we must examine how we can get those two worlds connected.  Senator Ruane touched on the gap between the life of the community and that of the school.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to the issue of mindfulness.  As a concept, mindfulness is interesting because there is a great degree of knowledge at some level in contemporary society around the possibilities for mindfulness.  Because teachers and educators are so hungry to be able to attend to these issues, what we see emerging in schools is like: \"This is going to be the next panacea.  This is going to solve the issue.\"<\/p> <p>  We know that mental health issues are complex and therefore it is a cause of concern if educators, understandably, reach out to take hold of something that might support their students.  However, we need to do it cautiously so that they are doing that in abidance with good practice and not adding to the damage that is there.  That is the general point I wanted to make in response to Deputy Martin's query about mindfulness.  It has lots of potential but we need to begin with teachers and educators first.  We began the conversation with children whereas we need to begin it with children and educators.  Both must be in parallel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487692800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The first thing I wanted to say was to Senator Ruane about the film \"I Used To Live Here\".  \"Yes\" is the answer to her question which was whether theatre can play a role in schools.  It was an interesting question because our theatre company was engaged by that community she spoke about in Killinarden to make the first version of that film around suicide.  We called it \"Bruised\".  Based on that, with the young people participating, other people saw it and out of that came a new project which resulted in the film \"I Used To Live Here\".  It is an interesting connection.  Things do grow from one small item to another.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the aesthetic engagement in schools.  It ties into what was said here about teachers feeling that they have to be psychiatrists, but are afraid of that.  I would echo the idea that all that teachers need to be given an opportunity to do is teach, and not to be involved in anything other than teaching.  <\/p> <p>  I am also involved in teacher training.  In teacher training, further education, adult and community education, we are trying to encourage this idea of teaching.  The problems in teaching have been identified for the past 20, 30, 40 or 50 years - that is, that standardisation of results and testing everyone at the same level produce a huge amount of stress.<\/p> <p>  The idea of managerialism coming in puts a lot more pressure on teachers because they have all of this to attend to, as well as preparing young people for a world of work which is the impact of the economy on them.  All of these have nothing to do with teaching at a fundamental level.  More and more teachers are getting fewer opportunities to teach.  The stressful output of that is passed right on to students and pupils, while their stress is passed down along the line.<\/p> <p>  Any good teacher knows how to produce an aesthetic engagement learning process if they have the time and are allowed to do it.  We should be trying to remove the other things out of their way in order to let that happen.  <\/p> <p>  We do not have a formal interaction with schools, but we certainly do a lot of projects when we are asked to go into schools.  Young people who have come up through the youth theatre have done quite a lot of them, so they teach and work with young people themselves.  However, there is not a formalised referral system.  We are a voluntary organisation so we do not have staff.  We could probably benefit from having staff who could look at the administrative work and that might happen in future.<\/p> <p>  Aesthetic engagement and short-term modules are vital, but that is what good teaching is.  Really good teaching is about inculcating that level of involvement and active mindfulness.  The artistic programme can be delivered in schools but I would reiterate that it is not something one can ask just anybody to do who has a love of it.  It needs careful implementation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hussey"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Are there any further questions from any of the members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#M01500","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Mr. King referred to teacher training which is a hobby horse of mine.  I think teachers are the key to this but I appreciate that they find it difficult, challenging and are afraid of it.  The word \"mental\" instils fear and I accept what Dr. Bates said, that it is a generational thing.  Our generation associates the word \"mental\" with the red brick building over the River Lee in Cork.  That is why we have a fear of it, but there is a new generation who have no hang-up about mental health issues.  Maybe we need to grow out of that, as opposed to trying to change it.  Feel the fear and do it anyway, and then progress and proceed.<\/p> <p>  Is Mr. King confident that steps are being taken, and that sufficient progress is being made, on teacher training?<\/p><p>I see my children at home and the level of trust, love and regard and so on they have nowadays for their teachers.

In preparation for today, I told the students with whom I work that I was to come before this committee and asked them what they would like me to say.  To a person, they all said this is a very important issue and one they want to put to the fore.  This echoes Deputy Daly's experience of his children's teachers.<\/p> <p>  The conversation about whether this is relevant has passed; the next stage is how we can go about it.  This is where the floundering is taking place.  There is a desire to do this but uncertainty over how to do it.  This goes back to the issue of people trusting themselves and professionals, attending to their own mental health and being comfortable about speaking about and expressing their difficulties.  Any initiative that can support this will be welcome but it must be done in a systematic way.  I think we would all agree that having good, positive, well-meaning intentions is not sufficient and that they can be potentially damaging.  This is a little like what Mr. Hussey said: having an interest in drama is very different from being able to teach it.  Mindfulness with teachers is similar.  There is a genuine well-being intentionality to work positively with and support children but it needs a skilled intervention.  There is a very open, positive mindset towards this issue, and this is something we should take away from today.  There has been a shift in culture to the effect that this is very topical, not just because it is topical in the news, but also because people feel it from the inside out.  If we can begin to harness and work with this, we can respond to the issue of mental health very proactively.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017022100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul King"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>On that note, on behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses.

We have had an unprecedented economic crisis.  We have not seen this bad a crisis since the 1930's.  Ireland was particularly hit by it and it is astonishing for me to be back here after two and a half or three years and to see how this country has recovered so quickly.  There are still many problems remaining but it is still astonishing to see the pace of recovery, which has not been copied by any other country that went through such a deep crisis.<\/p><p> Of course, this crisis has sapped our self-confidence as Europeans across the European Union in all member states.  Many of our people are wondering whether we are still masters of our own destiny and if we are still able to shape our future, if our children will still have jobs in this fourth industrial revolution and if we will still be able to maintain the levels of social protection we think we deserve, and that we do deserve.  All these questions have created an existential question about this European Union and the way we co-operate.  On top of that we have seen an unprecedented event, one of our member states deciding to leave the European Union, which has not happened before.  We need to tackle that as well.<\/p><p> We have a migration crisis.  We have a security crisis in terms of tackling terrorism.  We need to step up our efforts to create an economic success for the European Union, we need to make sure that protectionism does not prevail in the debate about international trade and we need to do all of this jointly.  I am also here to stress very clearly, however, that the European Commission will be at Ireland's side when we need to take into account the very special circumstances Ireland has to deal with in the Brexit debate.  Through its political ties, its historic ties, its geographical position and its economic structure, Ireland is a very special case in the Brexit debate.  I want to pledge here today before this committee that the European Commission will take these interests to heart and we will make sure that these interests are heard by everyone during the period of negotiations.

We knew at the outset that we had to make severe sacrifices in order to do so, and we did it.  It was not without pain.  There was a lot of pain across the country in almost every household.  Many people lost their homes in the course of it and are still losing their homes.  Its fallout still continues.  What it results in, unfortunately, is what has now become known as the various poverties, whether poverty accruing from a long period of unemployment, from lack of a home or from being unable to fund a mortgage on the home.  In line with the UN's strategic goals to eliminate poverty by 2030, could I ask Mr. Timmermans whether the European Union is conscious of where we are at now and what we need to do from here on?  For example, we cannot spend money building homes unless it is off balance sheet.  That is the particular quirk here, it has to be off balance sheet.<\/p><p>That is a restriction on the degree to which we can handle the homelessness issue now emerging  I am aware that it is endemic in some parts of Europe also.

Looking for possible solutions to the huge challenge it poses, what is the best forum to submit ideas and suggestions, not necessarily from parliamentarians either here or in the European Parliament, but from civic society - the business groups, the farming lobbies, the NGOs?  How can they really address the many huge problems that we will be facing into, particularly on this island and in the cross-Border context?<\/p> <p>  As I said to the Vice-President's colleagues when they were here, a key concern is what comes after Brexit.  Where can the European Union and the European ideal go after that?  Europe has taken a battering over the past decade.  It is vitally important that Europe stands up for itself and takes the fight to the eurosceptics, to the likes of Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders and Nigel Farage.  It needs to say that this is something worth fighting for, this is something worthwhile and that the outdated notions and generalisations of an aloof Brussels are not true.  It has to be done clearly, simply, and very aggressively.  I ask for Mr. Timmerman's views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#C00400","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1487680200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I welcome the Vice-President to the committee.  His statement that the Commission will be at Ireland's side in the forthcoming negotiations is to be welcomed.  His reiteration that Ireland is a very special case is very much appreciated.  There is no point going through the difficulties which Brexit poses for Ireland, and the island of Ireland in particular as they are well-known at this stage.  There are concerns about the erection of barriers to trade, the creation of a hard Border and the future of the common travel area.  Most importantly, there are real concerns about the future of the Northern Ireland peace process.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the sentiments expressed by the Vice-President, Ireland remains a fully committed, pro-active member of the European Union.  We appreciate the many challenges facing the EU, which he has outlined in his short address, and we want to be there to bring forward solutions to those challenges.  The Vice-President asks us to be creative.  The problem with Brexit will be in coming up with workable solutions acceptable to the other member states, and to the UK.  We will work on that and liaise with the EU institutions.  I hope that Ireland's particular situation could be dealt with in the initial draft papers brought forward by the Commission, and that our problems in regard to the fallout from Brexit can be dealt with up front in the process.<\/p> <p>  The Vice-President outlined the threats to the European Union from a rise in right-wing nationalism and populism, the decline in support for the Union and so forth.  Would the Vice-President comment on how he sees the Bratislava process unfolding, and what we can all do to ensure that the values which we cherish, represented by the Union, survive and are supported by the citizens of Europe?<\/p> <p>  In his address Mr. Timmermans mentioned the problems of unemployment, inefficiency, and the European Union not delivering.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Timmermans to elaborate on how we can increase support for the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#C00500","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487680200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>On the issue of strategic development goals and housing, while I do not have a complete solution today, the five presidents' report on the future of Economic and Monetary Union may include elements that will allow us to invest more.  The money is available in the markets and the need is there.  In some countries a failure to speed up building capacity will create another bubble in the housing sector, which would not profit anyone and be a big risk in any society.  I know what I am speaking about because we had a bubble in the Netherlands also.<\/p> <p>  It is already possible for Ireland to access the Juncker fund for investment in infrastructure.  This would be an interesting avenue to explore.  The fund is successful in a number of member states, but I am not fully aware of how successful it has been in Ireland to date.  It is growing very rapidly, especially in cases which involve a sustainability element.  If sustainable housing is being built, it is more interesting to look for options with the European Fund for Strategic Investments. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to another problem - I do not want to dodge the issue - when he asked to what extent it was permitted to do this while continuing to be in line with the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact.  We will have to have this discussion down the line because it is one that has popped up in a number of member states.  <\/p> <p>  How do we best submit suggestions on how to solve some of the fundamental problems some member states, especially Ireland, will have with Brexit?  We should use all opportunities available to us to influence people, including through the European Parliament and its representative in this area, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, and the Council of Ministers, in which Ireland is very active and held in high regard, in order that Mr. Didier Seeuws and his team will have all the information they need.  We are absolutely at the disposal of Ireland if it has issues it wishes to discuss with our team - Mr. Barnier and his people.  If people want me to be helpful in that regard, I will be at their disposal.  However, we need to be extremely creative because even if the Commission pays full attention to Ireland's challenges in this respect, it can never be as knowledgeable of the Irish situation as the Irish themselves.  While we will engage, we will also need Ireland's full engagement.  I would not advocate referring all of this to us.  The active participation of the Irish people will certainly help in finding solutions, especially those directly involved in cross-Border issues or certain industries, be it agriculture, fisheries or manufacturing.  It will be extremely important to have their input.  Already, industries in a number of member states have alerted me to their specific interest in this matter and called on me to ensure their interests will not be hurt in the forthcoming negotiations.  Mobilisation through trade unions and employers could also be very useful to all of us. <\/p> <p>  While I could speak for hours on it, I will make a couple of remarks about the big question Senator Neale Richmond and Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey put about the future.  What we have been doing in the past ten years is firefighting, as people in this country know better than anyone else.  Whenever people had worries or concerns, we responded with figures and statistics.  Politics is about striking a balance between hearts and minds.  In this matter, only the brain, not the heart, is involved.  We ended up in many countries, fortunately not Ireland, in the underbelly rather than the heart or brain.<\/p><p>The passion of anti-Europeans cannot be fought with PowerPoint presentations or statistics.  Passion can only be fought with passion.  Hate cannot be fought with hate.  Hate can only be fought by love and inclusion.  I think we have forgotten about that.  <\/p><p> I am not into party politics, I hope the committee does not get me wrong, but that is why I really appreciated the Taoiseach's speech on Europe last week, in which he did not talk primarily about the Internal Market or the common currency.  He spoke about values.  He spoke about the values we share.  The Common Market and the common currency are just instruments to underpin what we share in common in terms of values and where we want to be as a society.  If I look at that, what Europe needs in the coming decade is for us to tackle some of the problems that we have left unsolved.  People are disappointed in us and the European project because we have not yet found sustainable solutions for the migration crisis.  We have not yet found sustainable solutions for the security challenges, both those coming from the outside but also those internal to the European Union.  We have not offered an optimistic and sustainable prospect for the future of our economy.  We have so many opportunities in circular economy areas and in digital economy areas.  Why are we not using that potential to the full?  Why are we not doing something about youth unemployment?  In some of our member states youth unemployment is at 45% or 50%.  This is unacceptable and only when we start bringing solutions to these issues and can show that we are able to collectively provide a way forward, that people can people can believe in, can we start talking about the future shape of Europe.  This is exactly what the debate was about in Bratislava. <\/p><p> I am not one of those that one sometimes encounters in the European Parliament, who wish to have a huge debate about treaty change and changing all sorts of structural elements in the way we organise our co-operation.  I do not think our citizens are waiting for that.  Our citizens are waiting for us to come with solutions to the problems which they understand we cannot solve on our own in our member states.  Trade is one of them and a question on trade was also put to me.  If we do not counter the argument that most radical nationalists use, which is that to protect is to be protectionist, all of our economies will suffer, but none more than countries like Ireland and my own country, the Netherlands.  Protectionism has never and will never be an answer.  We need trade.  We need trade agreements worldwide.  CETA is a good example of where trade should be heading.  We need to have similar agreements across the world with other partners who believe in free trade as a driving force for our economy.  If we are successful in doing that and convincing people, I have no doubt that there will be a change of heart in the United States in that area because I honestly believe that protectionism will only weaken all of us and will not strengthen us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frans Timmermans","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487680200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice-President.

The first is on the issue of a transitionary period.  The Commission has said nothing really thus far, until the negotiations start, about a transitionary phase being required.  From our country's perspective it is essential that we have a transitionary phase given the close connections between the UK and Ireland.  I believe it would actually help the atmosphere of the negotiations if Michel Barnier and his team and President Juncker were to make that clear. <\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the existing six pack and two pack architecture.  Under this architecture, we have a procedure for exceptional circumstances which could affect the debt and deficit rule and the potential of flexibility for capital investment that some of my colleagues have raised with the Vice-President thus far.  Does Mr. Timmermans potentially see Brexit as an exceptional circumstance under the existing architecture?<\/p><p>The new lingo in Brussels is what we call asymmetric shocks but the existing financial governance package under the two-pack and six-pack is already there .  Does Mr. Timmermans think Brexit could be one of those?  <\/p><p> At the end of the two year divorce settlement, it states it will be determined by way of a strong qualified majority voting, QMV.  Is it not the case that we can come to an agreement by unanimity, whereby the 27 members states would have to accept the outcome of that divorce settlement with the United Kingdom?  Stage one of a three phase negotiation, would be a divorce settlement, a transitional phase and ultimately a new relationship.

Many of the households who are watching the proceedings have not experienced that recovery.  We do not have as high a youth unemployed rate as that instanced by Mr. Timmermans, but what is unfortunate is that our young people from towns and villages are leaving our shores and that is why our youth unemployment rate is not high.  There are significant areas that are suffering, with many households in huge debt.  We are always sensitive to those remarks.  It would be great if, like other areas of Europe, we had not been impacted by the recession.  Some areas of Ireland have done extremely well, but others have not.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Mr. Timmermans is aware that a motion has been passed in the Irish Parliament on a special category status in the EU.  What does Mr. Timmermans think of that?  People are talking about the Good Friday Agreement and joint sovereignty.  The EU has been imaginative in its approach to other areas of territorial dispute.  I hear from politicians about their huge sympathy and understanding for Ireland's part in the peace process.  I welcome his remarks on that. <\/p> <p> Would it be helpful if a delegation were to travel to the Border area to get a sense of the current position?  At present, there is no sense of a border.  The last thing that the peace process needs is a sense of fear or further division.  The worry is that if there is a permanent checkpoint, that will lead to a greater security detail, further militarisation and so on.  That delicate balance in the process itself will be lost.  Do the officials of the European Commission have such an understanding?  Do the EU parliamentarians understand the situation?<\/p> <p>  I am aware that in 2014 there was talk in terms of a follow up to the Anti-Corruption Report 2013.  We have seen protests in European capitals, such as Romania.  There have been allegations in respect of NAMA.  What is the rationale for dropping this report?  An issue arose during the French elections that the wife of one candidates was paid for fictitious work.  Would he agree with transparency?  Some members of the committee met with the Office of the Ombudsman, who spoke about the importance of transparency.  Clearly this is one of those areas, which I cannot understand, but why we would drop that report?<\/p> <p>  Migration is the significant issue facing Europe.  On the EU-Turkey deal, a country of safe origins, many of us across Europe have concerns about that.  We are speaking in terms of replicating that deal in respect of Libya.  Libya is a failed state, a country that is tribal and so on.  Malawi is another country in the middle of a civil war similar to all of the difficulties that we know are happening in Turkey.  Why are we replicating those ideas?<\/p><p>The German Chancellor is talking about member states not participating each time in all steps forward towards integration.  It is almost as though there will be different tiers and different ways forward.  The concern is that there will be first-class membership and second-class membership.  Again, we need better reforms, democratic and transparent accountability and so on all over the European Union.  They are three of the huge concerns and worries that people have with regard to the governments.  I would appreciate it if the witness could expand on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#F00200","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487680200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Mr. Timmermans is very welcome.  I have a couple of questions for him.  First and foremost, everybody we speak to in Europe talks about the special status for Northern Ireland.  Will the witness accept that it is a three-way process that will involve the goodwill of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland in negotiating some sort of special relationship?  I feel that it will ultimately be a political solution.  Is it the case that the Commission is waiting for the Irish Government to come forward with a proposal and possible solution to that political problem?  Would that be the view of the witness, or are we to expect the Commission to come forward with a solution to that problem?  If the European Commission is expecting Ireland to do it, is it going to give us the freedom to negotiate bilaterally with the UK in the lead-up period in order to establish what the ground rules are?<\/p> <p>  Due to the massive trade relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, if we are to remain good Europeans - and I sincerely hope we do - we will need massive support for market diversification in order that we can start to withdraw from the UK market as other non-EU countries start to enter that market, particular in the area of agriculture.  There are various other areas as well.  We will need support and funding for that process of market diversification to take place and we will possibly need a relaxing of some of the rules with respect to State aid for local industries.  The witness will be aware that there are creameries on the Border taking milk from as far north as one can go down to Roscommon.  That is a problem for us.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the Commission's role in representing Ireland.  I know that Ireland will have a place at the table.  How important is a tiny little island on the periphery of Europe?  How do our needs fare in the Commission's thinking?  We talk about forging new partnerships with governments.  However, it is not governments that I am concerned about.  I am concerned about the people on the ground.  The rise of populism is coming from the people on the ground.  In this country, a lot of people feel that we were hung out to dry in order to save the economic community and the euro as a result of the financial collapse.  The collapse occurred right across Europe.  We talk about the recovery in Ireland, but many people here feel that we carried the major burden.<\/p> <p>  Whatever about forging partnerships with parliaments, what plans has the Commission in place to forge partnerships with people on the ground?  This would mean supporting new infrastructure in Ireland through the European Investment Bank and providing direct access to Europe without having to cross to the UK, which would mean developing our ports or a new highway to Europe, if the Commission wanted to do so.

We have heard a lot of comments made in the United Kingdom, but the real judgment can only be made when we have the letter stipulating what they want.<\/p><p> I will speak about Ireland and its exceptional circumstances.  Let me be brutally clear about this.  Yes, there are exceptional circumstances.  No, there cannot be bilateral negotiations.  That would play exactly into the hands of the British who are trying to play off one country against the other.  However, we can only convince Ireland not to have bilateral negotiations if it feels that what the European Commission is doing is in its interest and reflects what it needs and wants.  That is why I feel so engaged in this.  The Commission should prove to Ireland that its interests are being taken fully on board.  That is the only way we can convince Ireland and, by the way, all of the other member states not to start parallel negotiations.  Britain will try with every single member state to see if it can create a bilateral parallel process in the nature of diplomacy.  Again, I do not blame them.  They are fighting for the interests of their country like we are fighting for the interests of the 27 remaining countries.  That is how this will play out.  I do not think it will be in the interests of the 27.  I believe that if we do our job well, it will not be in the interest of Ireland to opt for a bilateral negotiation apart from what the European Commission is doing.<\/p><p> On the unanimity requirements, I believe we need unanimity for the new relationship because that will have to be decided unanimously.

The process can be discussed.  Legally, it can be discussed.  However, politically, these two processes will somehow be connected, to put it very mildly.  In that sense, we need everyone on board if we want it to be successful, regardless of all the legal questions we might have.<\/p> <p>  I fully share Deputy Crowe's analysis when he says that people do not feel the recovery.  I appreciate that a lot.  I also see it in the country I know best.  That is a country that was not hit as hard by crisis as Ireland was.  That is a country with just 5% unemployment, probably zero budget deficit this year and rapidly declining public debt.  Still, people feel that they are living in a country in deep crisis and that the bankers are doing well again but the people are not.  One of the reasons why populism is so much on the rise is that across the EU many people, especially in the middle classes, feel that it is no longer about them.  They feel that it is about the rich people, the bankers, the multinationals and not about them.  If we are incapable of proving to our voters that this is about them, that they are reflected in our policy and that they will see light at the end of the tunnel, they will sooner or later be tempted by the very easy solutions of the populists who say that it is about us, that we should close our societies to differences and remove those who are responsible for our problems.  This divisive and almost xenophobic attitude is on the rise, and not because people are xenophobes or racists, but because they are desperate.  They do not see that their interests are reflected enough in our policies.<\/p><p> It people like Ms Le Pen, Mr. Wilders and others and their ideologies that are to blame for this and not the people who vote for them because many of the people who vote for them would vote for somebody else if he or she had something to offer they could believe in.  There is a lot for us to do across the political spectrum from left to right.  All people of good will across the European Union need to come to terms with this challenge.  It is interesting that in those countries hardest hit in the crisis there are almost no extreme right movements on the rise.  People always say that the rise of such movements is linked to poverty but I am not so sure about that.  Greece lost one-quarter of its wealth and while there is an extreme right movement in Greece it is marginal.  There are no extreme right movements in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus or Ireland.  It is an interesting phenomenon that it is in the richer countries of Europe that they are on the rise.  This is not about what people have suffered but what they can expect for the future.  We have a huge responsibility to offer a better view of the future that we have thus far.<\/p><p> On the anti-corruption report, the Commission decided not to revisit the 2014 exercise in relation to the anti-corruption report.  Personally, I was a little disappointed that this stood apart from all of the other policies, such that anti-corruption would be discussed only in the framework of the anti-corruption report.  I want this to be mainstreamed.  I want anti-corruption to be part of other reports such as our economic forecasts for member states and other reports in relation to member states.  It should not be set apart.  I am still in a debate with the European Parliament on this matter.  I will need to prove to Emily O'Reilly and others that we can do a better job by mainstreaming our fight against corruption rather than having it set apart in a report.  The onus is on me to prove that we can do that.  Romania is an interesting case.  As soon as the population of Romania got the impression that the Government was going to be lax on anti-corruption they took to the streets.  Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the Government changed course and overturned its decision.  There is a strong appetite in all member states for the fight against corruption.  It is always one of the top items in our euro barometer research, particularly in those states that are still suffering a lot of corruption.  We need to stand by the people who want corruption to be removed from the public sphere.<\/p><p> On agreements with other countries and the replication of the Turkish agreement, the Turkish agreement cannot be replicated because the circumstances are not comparable.  When it comes to Turkey and Libya, the only thing we need to do that is comparable is break the backbone of the smuggling operation.  We need to stop smugglers putting people on boats, which puts them at high risk of drowning in the Mediterranean.  That is unacceptable.  We need to fight the smuggling rings and to do that with determination.  We also need to have arrangements in place with the countries of origin such that they take back people who do not have the right to international protection, or prevent people from leaving by giving them a better perspective.  We also need to have arrangements with the countries bordering the Mediterranean so that we jointly fight illegal migrant.  That is what we need to do but it is not comparable to what we have done with Turkey.  The deal we have with Turkey is working.  We have been able to improve the living conditions of Syrians living in Turkey, including through increased access to education and work.  Their living conditions have also been improved and they have greater access than ever to health care.  We have never been able to disburse so much money in such a brief period of time as in the case of the Syrian refugees in Turkey.<\/p><p> On multi-speed Europe, much depends on how one defines that.  Some would define multi-speed Europe as a bunch of countries setting up something entirely new and going off in their own direction.  I would interpret it as being similar to what happens in the areas of economic and monetary union, the euro and justice and home affairs.  We all travel in the same direction but not necessarily at the same speed.  In some areas, if it is not convenient to do so, then a country does not participate in the next phase of co-operation.  That is how I would interpret multi-speed Europe.  It is a way of keeping Europe together, it is not a way of creating divisions in the European Union.  We have good experience of this in the past.  Ireland has chosen not to be part of the Schengen area because of its special conditions.  That is an acceptable example of multi-speed Europe.<\/p><p> We depend on the goodwill of the EU, the UK and Ireland but it is in all our interests that we, as a Commission, prove to Ireland that we can be its best advocates and representatives in those negotiations such that it should not have to engage in bilateral negotiations.  On market differentiation, it is a good idea regardless of what happens.  It would be a good idea to review our Structural Funds policy.  On partnerships with people, I am not sure how that would pan out.  For example, in the context of the European Fund for Strategic Investment, EFSI, or the \"Juncker fund\", in a country such as France, never before have SMEs had such direct access to European funds.  Never before have we been able to create a direct relationship between the European Investment Bank and local entrepreneurs in all parts of France.  That is working well.  For the first time, SMEs have direct access to European investment.  Under EFSI, the European Investment Bank approved four agreements with financial intermediaries.  Financing totals &euro;106 million and is expected to trigger &euro;589 million in investment.  Some 2,900 small companies or start-ups will benefit from this support.  In terms of partnerships with people that is the direction we should be going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frans Timmermans","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487680200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his responses.

I say that because at the time of the economic crisis in Ireland, David Cameron, the then Prime Minister of Britain said in a speech that the UK trades more with the Republic of Ireland than with China, Russia, India and Brazil together.  That shows the strong level of trade between our two nations.  Also, 90% of our exports to Europe go through the UK.  As a result of the fact that Ireland will be worst affected by Brexit we should engage in bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom.  Ireland is a small nation in Europe and it could be left behind.  Perhaps the Commissioner would elaborate on why Ireland should not seek to put in place bilateral agreements with the UK.  Ireland is the only country that will share a border with the UK when it leaves Europe.<\/p> <p>  The EU as a whole must change its attitude towards European citizens.

The sense of joy at feeling Irish and European was great.  There was great excitement.  There was a sense of pride when we held the Presidency, a sense that it was great for Ireland.  That has disappeared.  We now have a non-elected President.  What has gone wrong with the European Union?  We have lost the people.

We are now left, an island in the Atlantic, separated from Europe and as time goes on we will feel lost because there is no sense of being European.  I regarded myself as an Irishman first and a European and I was proud of that because I was made feel part of Europe.  Now things are hived off here and there.  We have even lost the concept of the free movement of people because some member states do not want people moving around Europe.  When there was a crisis with people coming in from outside they closed their borders and nobody said boo to them but poor countries such as Greece took many on board. <\/p> <p>  I welcome the visit of Mr. Timmermans but it is an opportunity to be truthful with each other and to say what we feel.  I am saying what I feel.  I do not know whether my colleagues feel the same way.  It is dissolving in front of us because of rules and regulations and funds.  We were so pleased, especially as an island nation, to be part of a bigger family and to feel that we could move around freely and broaden our views.  The present generation does not have the sense of excitement that we had when we joined first.  The European Union as a body needs to reinvigorate itself, to bring us back to feeling European.  We do not feel European.

I share some of my colleagues' concerns.  Is Mr. Timmermans concerned that anti-EU groups are allowed a platform to oppose the EU and to talk about other member states considering doing what the UK has done?  That is a reality.  A vacuum seems to be allowed exist where these groups can articulate their case and we do not seem to be combatting it and talking about the positive aspects of being involved in the EU and the advantages it brings.  Notwithstanding all the positives, the people of this State feel that the EU issues diktats on legislation and policy.  It is becoming difficult for people in rural Ireland or running businesses to manage and survive with the level of legislation they have to comply with and which they sometimes feel is unnecessary.  Is Mr. Timmermans concerned about that and how could it be dealt with?<\/p> <p>  I share my colleagues' views on exports, given the amount of business we do with the UK.  Mr. Timmermans says Ireland will be treated as a special case in these talks.  The exports to and via the UK are very important for our small economy.  The small and medium enterprise SME sector is trying to survive having gone through a difficult time for trade.  It is very important to our economy especially in the food industry.  <\/p> <p>  Is Mr. Timmermans suggesting, given that we know the difficulties this poses, that we need to bring forward solutions to the problems?

I would like him to be clear that most of us would not agree with having a bilateral arrangement or negotiations with Britain.  I rejected that on behalf of my party when it was floated following the report from the House of Lords.<\/p><p>I, on behalf of my party, rejected this when it was floated after the publication of the House of Lords report.  It would not be in our interests but that is where it is right now.  It stands as long as our interests are considered and included in the EU negotiations with the United Kingdom.  However, to be clear, if we were to feel that our views and concerns were not being dealt with in this regard, we of course would reserve the right.  I agree with the position of Mr. Timmermans that everyone will enter these negotiations and look for advantages and so they should.  Britain will try to look after the best interests of its people.  We want to look after the best interests of our people, North and South - I will return to that - and, most importantly, the future of the European Union itself.<br\/><br\/>I am somewhat more confident than some members.  Sometimes it is good to be in the middle of the Atlantic while being part of Europe.  Our relationship with Britain as a country is that we are its fifth biggest market.  We must be confident that we, the European Union and Ireland, will continue to trade with Britain.  The question is how to get to that stage.  This is why I wish to ask Mr. Timmermans about a matter Mr. Hayes, MEP, raised earlier.  With Britain exiting the customs union, Mr. Michel Barnier gave his view that there would be some transitional arrangements.  I agree with him.  However, Commissioner Moscovici then said nothing would happen until after two years.  This would be dangerous for all.  We should be realistic about how this will be done, particularly in respect of customs and trade.  I understand there are people on both sides of the fence who do not particularly like one other.  Those on one side do not like the fact that Britain is leaving and sometimes feel we need a big stick to punish those on the other.  This is not in anyone's interests.  It is neither in Ireland's interests nor the European Union's interests.  I ask Mr. Timmermans to clarify this from a Commission perspective.  Which position is it - Commissioner Moscovici's or Mr. Barnier's - or is there a third person in the middle who makes some sense of this?<br\/><br\/>I have put my next point to our Government by way of parliamentary question.  What is the Commission's view on an EU reform fund?  There are unique aspects to Ireland's position and other countries also trade extensively with Britain and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The relaxation of state aid rules for certain sectors should therefore be considered.  Most crises just fall on one's lap.  They just happen, and every country, every government and its people, must deal with them.  This is a crisis we know is coming down the track.  We can plan for it and should be able to do so already, considering in particular the sectors that require our support, both in Ireland and the European Union.  We know there will be difficulties when the Article 50 letter is sent and over the next few years.  I do not sense that such preparation is under way and I do not believe it is okay just to say we must wait and see what the British are looking for.  That is true in one respect, but I know, as I am sure does Mr. Timmermans, that Britain is supporting its indigenous industries.  We have also seen this with export industries from outside the European Union.  We do not know what support Britain has been giving to some of the car manufacturers but one had better believe it is probably better than the EU supports given to Irish companies, for argument's sake, or Dutch companies for that matter.  Consequently, we should consider this again.  Will Mr. Timmermans give a commitment that consideration will be given to a relaxation of the state aid rules and the creation of an EU reform fund to which all countries or sectors, not just Ireland, could apply?<br\/><br\/>I was very heartened by Mr. Timmermans' comments about the head versus the heart.  He is 100% correct that one cannot fight anti-EU sentiment with spreadsheets and pie charts.  We must try to be positive and show what has been positive about the European Union.  For too long all its negative elements have been emphasised.  It is right people are critical - do not get me wrong.  However, the fact that the Commission's judgment on the Apple case came a few weeks after Brexit happened should be considered from a political perspective.  I thought the Commission was the best and brightest of the European Union but even the timing of the judgment should be considered.  I still believe the Commission overstepped the mark in that case.  We must be more conscious of the EU itself and how our people feel within it.  I for one want to see the European project move forward.  I would be particularly interested to hear Mr. Timmermans' views on the few items I have raised with him.<br\/><br\/>My very final point concerns the common travel area, which was reaffirmed by the Amsterdam treaty.  We believe the common travel area is not in any way up for negotiation.<\/p><p>We will have the largest number of European Union citizens living outside the EU, that is, Irish citizens in the North of Ireland, to whom we in Ireland have a duty of care under the Good Friday Agreement and previous international treaties.  This is our unique case and the unique aspect to our position.  Hundreds of thousands of people - indeed, more than 1 million people - living outside the EU will be more than entitled to Irish citizenship and, by extension, EU citizenship.<\/p><p> The next few years will not be easy.  I ask that we consider the few matters I have raised.  I welcome Mr. Timmermans' engagement.  It is very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#M00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487680200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Vice President Timmermans is very welcome, and it is good to hear his views.  My questions are largely tied in with those of the previous few speakers.  We feel very European, as opposed to the British.  However, as has been said, we have such a tie-in and connection with them, in respect of people and trade, with both the North and Britain, that we cannot ignore them, whether we like it or not.  We have agreements with them going back to 1922, despite our history of having fought with them before that.  All of this predates the EU, so it is natural that our Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have had these meetings.  I fully accept that we cannot have the bilateral arrangement to which Mr. Timmermans has referred.  We wish to be on the European side in the negotiations.  However, at the same time, Mr. Timmermans must appreciate that we must keep our free travel arrangement with Britain.  As he said, this is a question of the hearts element of the notion of hearts and minds.  I do not understand why Britain wants to leave both the Single Market and the customs union.  I do not know how we will bridge this but I feel, from what Mr. Timmermans has said - I suppose this is natural - that until we get into the negotiations, it cannot be worked out.  However, there is a willingness on his part and, I think, some of his colleagues to make the transition, although I do not know how.

Mr. Timmermans talked about solutions.  I wish in a non-partisan way to throw two short questions out to him.  We all know about the formation of the EU.  It was a peace project in the first instance and then an economic project.  Is there merit in the EU taking a clear stance on the peace process and recognising that this North-South project needs special status on its own?  While I know there are links in this regard to the economy and peace on our island, is there merit to the Commission's considering this and saying we must deal with this aspect of peace?  This includes a continuation of the lack of a hard Border.  Any diminution in the invisibility of the Border that currently exists is probably one of the most contentious issues that will arise in negotiations.  The unequivocal support for this is significant in the context of the status of the Good Friday Agreement as a solemn, sovereign agreement.<\/p> <p>  My second question is rather simplistic but concerns probably the biggest issue arising in the Border region.  I refer to our agriculture industry.  I will ask a simple question.  The integrity of our food on an all-Ireland basis must be protected.  We know the history of foot and mouth disease, BSE and the horsemeat scandal in recent years.  Without talking about special trade deals, would it not make sense for the EU to recognise that Ireland needs to brand its agricultural produce on an all-island basis and be allowed to market that produce on an all-Ireland basis, North and South, into England and the EU to bestow on this island an integrity regarding its food produce?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#O00300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487680200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I have three brief questions.

While we accept that the major Brexit-related decisions will be taken in Brussels by the European Council, with the input of the Commission, is it not the reality that we have seen in recent times when major crises have affected the European Union that much of the behind-the-scenes discussions were carried out in Berlin and Paris, sidelining the views and concerns of other member states?<\/p><p>We do not want to see a repeat of that.

The lack of a visible border is an integral part of that and any moves to change that would be not just troublesome, but disastrous.

I wish I could answer them, but if I were to answer them in public they would have an effect immediately on things still to happen in the future.  I am simply not in a position to pre-empt some of these elements.  I want to assure the members that I have taken very careful note of these remarks.  I will take them back and share them with Michel Barnier and others so that the people are very much of where this Parliament and Ireland stand on this.<\/p> <p>  As Commission, we need to prove we duly represent the interest of Ireland in this negotiation.  Then all bets are off in terms of how Ireland behaves in that.  This applies to every single member state.  Every single member state will want to be seen as duly represented by us.  However, Ireland is not every single member state; Ireland is a very special case in this negotiation.  If I was not already aware of that before this meeting, this meeting has confirmed that in so many different ways.<\/p> <p>  Let me repeat something I have said publicly before.  I was born in 1961.  Throughout my childhood and early adulthood I was witness to terrible violence in the North of this island.  We were all brought up with that.  Many of us thought this could never be solved.  When I was young I truly thought that this was part of life and that people would continue murdering each other for generations to come.  Then this miracle of the Good Friday Agreement came about.  I believe we have a political and moral duty to do everything within our power to maintain the Good Friday Agreement and everything that entails.  I am sorry I cannot be clearer than that today, but I hope members will understand my personal commitment to this.<\/p> <p>  The EU has been a strong supporter of developments in Northern Ireland.  I remember Belfast 30 or 40 years ago.  If we look at Belfast now, what has been achieved is incredible.  The EU has spent up to &euro;2 billion in developing the North in many ways.  Many years ago it was a terrible rust belt, especially Belfast.  Now we should look at what is coming up there in terms of the economy.  We also have reason to be optimistic.  However, I am fully aware of all the difficulties in agriculture, transport, manufacturing and trade that we will face in the coming years.  I again pledge that the Commission is on Ireland's side on that.<\/p><p>Referring to what the Co-Chairman said, there is a paradox in having a predominance of big member states, which is logical in a Union of so many small countries.  The big countries are big only in name because globally we only have small member states by comparison with the rest of the world.  However, the response to having big and small member states is not to take competences away from the Commission and put them in the hands of the European Council because that would be rewarding big member states.  The Commission can offer protection against the force of big member states.  It is what we have been doing traditionally but we need to prove we can do that every day; I agree with the Co-Chairman.<br\/><br\/>The onus is on us to prove this is not just driven by Berlin and Paris but takes into account the interests of all member states.  It is not just Ireland; certain other member states have very big interests at stake here, some of which I know extremely well.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the EU <i>per se<\/i>, it is time for those of us who believe in the EU to speak up for the EU and stop being intimidated by this populist rhetoric.  The EU is not about Brussels; it is not about the European Parliament; it is not about the European Commission.  The EU is about citizens who want to live in peace with other citizens with whom they have had wars for centuries.  That is still the essence of the EU.<br\/><br\/>In every member state Brexit has led to less support for leaving the EU rather than more support for leaving the EU.  There is not one member state today where a majority of the population would be in favour of leaving the EU.  I apologise to Deputy Barrett for interrupting him, but I wondered what countries he was referring to when he said that there would be a host of countries wanting to leave the EU.  While it might change in the future, at this stage I do not see it.  Rather than driving euroscepticism, the shock of Brexit has led people to reconsider.  Paradoxically the fact that this European Union could collapse, which I think is a reality, has brought forward more pro-European feelings than we had previously.<br\/><br\/>What is most threatening to the EU is that we take it for granted and are completely indifferent to what happens to it.  The enemy of the EU is not anti-EU feeling; it is indifference about the EU because anti-EU feeling is a minority view in almost all if not all remaining member states.  We need to mobilise the population for this project.  I passionately believe in this project especially if we can interest younger people, not in the structures of the EU or the institutions but in the ideals of the EU.  Our young generation are no longer ideological but they are very idealistic about working together with others.  I think that is where Europe's future resides.<br\/><br\/>Let me be perfectly clear about this.  The problem with young people is that they take Europe for granted.  It is not that they do not like it.  It has created their natural habitat of Europe as a place where they can go wherever they like without any problems because of cheap air fares - some Irish companies are very successful in providing that.  It is not an institutional Europe or a Brussels Europe but a Europe of the people because they can travel to Barcelona for the weekend or to Riga to have a stag party or whatever.  That is the reality of our children's lives.  This is a Europe that should also be recognised as a positive thing.  It was unimaginable for my parents for whom the German was still the enemy.  I think it is a miracle.<br\/><br\/>I need to answer the specific question on Georgia.  President Juncker has been very clear that in the term of this Commission up to 2019 there will be no enlargement of the European Union.  There is also very little appetite in member states to start enlargement discussions.  I believe we can make huge progress with Georgia.<\/p><p>Georgia should feel that its wish to be part of the European family, if I can put it that way, should be translated in measures in terms of co-operation, investment and visa-free travel.  All that should be done and it is urgent to do that, but we should be realistic about enlargement.  It is not going to happen for the foreseeable future, certainly not in the mandate of this Commission.  My assessment today is that the urgency with enlargement would probably reside more with the western Balkans before we go into the Caucasus, but I am speaking beyond my brief because my brief only goes to 2019 and that will happen after 2019.<br\/><br\/>I answered the question on whether we should negotiate separately.  In terms of the questions on Mr. Trump, I have been very clear that if immigration restrictions are based on religion or race, they are a discrimination which should not be allowed to happen.  We have been very clear about that.  We have seen also that the American judicial system works rather well in correcting these things.  We can have faith in American institutions in so far as that is concerned.<br\/><br\/>We now have the Maltese Presidency and it is performing very well.  In my experience over the past 30 years, the smaller the country, the more successful the Presidency because small countries can more easily sell at home that it is at the service of the 28 or later the 27, whereas when a big member state holds the Presidency, it has to prove that it brings a lot of success to that member state<i>per se<\/i>, and usually that does not work very well.  The Maltese Presidency is successful and I very much look forward to the Estonian Presidency, which will be the next Presidency, as of 1 July.<br\/><br\/>I believe I have answered-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017022100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frans Timmermans","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487680200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I asked about state aid.

He said as well that the Commission has a political and moral duty to maintain the Good Friday Agreement.  That is so correct.  What we said in discussions with other groups that appeared before the committee and to other committees of the Houses is that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations must not result in the diminution in any way of the workings, aspirations or the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The role of the European Union has been critical in getting us to this stage.  The financial support for the various programmes such as INTERREG and PEACE has been critical.  Substantial funds have been drawn down by both the Irish and British Governments and by statutory agencies and voluntary groups throughout the island in support of the peace process.  Much of the funding went to the least advantaged areas in Northern Ireland and the Border area and it was very important in terms of improving the lot of disadvantaged communities.  We want to see that continue.<\/p> <p>  As a representative of a Border area, I have seen this island transformed since 1998.  We do not want to go one step backwards.  The outcome of Brexit is critical for the entire island.  I hope the First Vice President can reinforce to his colleagues on the Commission the importance of ensuring no aspect of the Good Friday Agreement is diminished and that we want the island to continue to grow on a North-South and east-west basis, and that we will build on what has been achieved to date.<\/p><p>We cannot countenance going backwards.

Unfortunately, they could not be here on the first day of this series of meetings but I am glad that they are here now.  I have seen their submission and note it refers to their original submission to the expert commission.  I am more interested in the comments that have been made on the group's behalf since the expert commission reported on its findings.  Mr. Gibney and Mr. Brendan Ogle signed the original submission but I can only comment on what Mr. Ogle has said in public since then.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses will know, the committee has been charged with the responsibility to investigate, analyse and scrutinise the recommendations made by the expert commission to see if we can come up with a formula whereby we can all agree on a way forward based on those recommendations.  Since we began the process one of the issues that has crystalised is the fact that district metering can play a role in identifying individual leakage and, therefore, excessive usage.  We now know, in more stringent terms, that metering is not the only show in town for the conservation of water.  Other options need to be explored and could be incorporated into the overall solution.<\/p> <p>  I will quote directly what was said by Mr. Ogle when he was interviewed by Sean O'Rourke who sought his immediate reaction to the expert commission's recommendations.  Mr. Ogle said that the bottom line for him was that the report confirmed that Ireland was not wasteful in terms of its usage.  He also accepted the findings in the report and confirmed that he was opposed to people wasting water.  Sean O'Rourke asked Mr. Ogle the direct question, \"Are you opposed to charging for wasters?\"  The interviewer meant people who waste water excessively.  Mr. Ogle replied,  \"I am not opposed\".  Sean O'Rourke then asked him, \"How would you do it?\"  Mr. Ogle said, \"I think people who waste water, well the CER has been given the job of working out what the limits are, and I do believe we need to stop waste\".  We have since qualified and possibly quantified excessive use through district metering that remains outstanding.  Can the witnesses qualify Mr. Ogle's remarks?  How would they penalise anyone who uses excessive amounts if and when we have identified what is excessive?  Let us say the Minister said 123 litres a day was acceptable and we suggested the limit should be two or three times that amount and recommended a swimming pool take for beyond that amount.  How would the witnesses penalise people who use more than that amount of water?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022100002#B00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487676600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I apologise for being unable to attend on the last occasion but, as people are probably aware, there was a union emergency due to the Tesco dispute.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the words spoken by Mr. Ogle, I cannot remember them but I can outline the perspective of Right2Water.  Ireland, as the report proves, is not a wasteful country when it comes to water.  In fact we are one of best countries to conserve water in the EU and the broader world.  As the report states, Ireland has more water available than almost any other country in Europe or the world.   Ireland has 50 times more potable water than the likes of Israel and far more than France.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of penalising people for excessive use of water, there is a provision in the 2007 Act, as I am sure the committee is aware.

Right2Water is not opposed to the Government introducing a swimming pool tax.  There might be a provision in terms of commercial water charges and taxes.  <\/p> <p>  If we want to address waste then let us address areas where water is wasted.  As much as 41% of water is lost through leaks.  The Government instead of funding measures to address the leakage problem has funded the installation of unnecessary and unwanted water meters.  Household water meters have shown up approximately 3% of the leaks.  Therefore, the remaining 97% is not on the household side.  I disagree with the report's claim that wastage happens in households.  The wastage is due to leakages across the country.  As much as &euro;1 billion or whatever has been spent on water meters.  Had we spent the money on addressing the leakage problem we would have addressed the crisis in the water services.<\/p> <p>  There is a provision in the 2007 Act.

My focus and that of Fine Gael has been trying to fund a mechanism whereby we can address those problems as soon as possible.

Let us consider the tax cuts that have taken place since budget 2015 and ask where the money should come from.  The income tax change that year resulted in &euro;405 million being lost to the Exchequer as a result of tax cuts.  Changes to USC cost &euro;27 million and the USC threshold cut the following year was &euro;772 million.  I can list figures for other areas, but the total is &euro;2.7 billion.<\/p> <p>  If we want to address housing, health care or other areas, perhaps we should stop giving tax cuts as a first priority.  In terms of the households the Deputy mentioned where there are problems, that is a direct result of the cut of 65% in the budget for water services.  The two points are linked.  The &euro;405 million figure I mentioned was targeted at the top 17% of earners at a time when we were trying to impose water charges on the poorest of our population, one in ten of whom is already experiencing food poverty.  We also have the highest fuel poverty rate in Europe.  The introduction of water poverty is not the way forward for us as a society. <\/p> <p>  We have evidence across Europe and the rest of the world from all of the people we have met from Detroit, Berlin, Rome and France about the implications of introducing water charges.  Every single one of the places I have mentioned now has water poverty.  The UK has a 23.6% water poverty rate.  There is a 15% water poverty rate in Wales.<\/p> <p>  Let us address the core issue of what is best economically, environmentally and socially.  In terms of economics, in 2011 Gerry Concannon warned the Government that introducing water charges would mean doubling the cost of providing our water services from &euro;350 per annum per domestic unit to &euro;700.  All of that involves extra costs such as the metering process and the advertising budget - Irish Water spent &euro;3 million in 11 months on advertising and &euro;6 million on postage costs.  There is a significant cost to introducing water charges.  The best way to address the water crisis is to stop giving tax cuts and instead invest in the water infrastructure which has been severely damaged by the underfunding that has happened as a result of successive Government cuts.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about ring-fencing money, the expert commission's report covers that area.  An excessive charge for over 150% of domestic usage could raise between &euro;14 million and &euro;30 million.  To me, economically it does not make sense to try to raise &euro;14 million to &euro;30 million chasing down 7% of households.  Spending &euro;270 million for a return of &euro;30 million makes no economic sense.<\/p> <p>  In terms of environmentalism and conservation, the report states that there is no evidence that there is any excessive wastage of water in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of social implications, 70,000 families across Detroit have had their water shut off.  People say that happened in America and could never happen here, but the same has happened in Rome, parts of France and in the UK.  Five people from the Detroit Water Brigade who have no access to water because they could not afford to pay their bills came to visit us.  One of them has had her water shut off three times.  In Detroit, if one's water is shut off one has 48 hours to have it switched back on, otherwise the authorities can take dependants away because it is a requirement to have water running in a home.  After 72 hours one's house becomes condemnable.  That is what we are trying to prevent by bringing in water charges. <\/p> <p>  The first part of that process involved installing water meters, and that is why the Right2Water campaign and the 62% to 66% of the population who are opposed to water charges are mobilising on the streets and saying this is not good enough.  We need to stop giving tax cuts and instead invest in water infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1487676600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gibney for his response.  We talked about taxes.  Many people on his side of the argument refer to taxing the wealthy, which is a fairly easy mantra.  At times the general public do not realise that 6% of the highest earners in this country pay 49% of the income tax and USC, which is a fairly substantial figure.  They are also the key people who drive business and economic activity in this country.<\/p> <p>  I am surprised that Mr. Gibney is opposed to cuts in income tax for ordinary workers.  When I was first elected as a Deputy in 2011, I was surprised by the number of people who came to my office who were in receipt of social welfare and told me it did not pay to go back to work because the gap was too big.  We knew we needed to cut direct taxation on work in order to make work pay.<\/p> <p>  Let me be very clear.  In my mind, the greatest beneficiaries of the recovery from recession have been householders who in 2011 and 2012 did not have a job but who now have one or two earners and children who know what it is for Mummy and Daddy to get up in the morning and go to work.  That is why we made changes and have 190,000 people in work today who were not in jobs in 2012.  That is why this year alone we will create an extra 45,000 jobs in the economy.  Everything is focused on that.<\/p> <p>  I am surprised by Mr. Gibney's proposal regarding why we should not have water charges and should instead increase direct taxation and income tax on workers.

Probably the best comparison we can make in terms of our climate and water services is with the United Kingdom.  In 1989, water charges were introduced in the UK for the first time.  Since then, every single year the price of water has gone up by double the rate of all other goods in the economy according to the retail price index.  Because of that, a quarter of all households are now experiencing water poverty.  A large part of that is as a result of borrowing.  For instance, seven of the biggest water companies in the UK, including Northumbrian Water and Thames Water, borrow excessive amounts of money to fund their water infrastructure.  Northumbrian Water borrows at an interest rate of 11%.  It does so because it is borrowing from its own bank, which is the owner of Northumbrian Water.<\/p> <p>  The average household in the UK is now paying &pound;80 per year to fund the debt and interest rates, which ends up being 21% of a water bill.  That 21% is servicing the debt.   We do not want to go down the road of borrowing because we will end up in debt.  Then instead of the money going into water infrastructure it goes to servicing debt for big banks.  <\/p> <p>  In Detroit, it is estimated that 46% of what they pay for water bills goes towards servicing debt.  We therefore have big concerns about the terms of reference that were given to the expert water commission, which specified only one way of funding water through borrowings.  We would much prefer if the funding went directly through general taxation which would avoid getting into debt on that side of things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1487676600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I need to move on now, if that is okay.

The Financial Services Union, FSU, was formerly the Irish Bank Officials Association and is a key stakeholder in the industry.  To the delight of members, I am not going to read my submission into the record.  I will instead focus on a couple of main headings in the context of the key issues we want to bring to the attention of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Our members have paid a significant price for the calamitous management of the banking sector.  The latter had a huge impact on staffing, the future of the industry and customers.  We believe that the industry is in the process of dynamic change.  There are opportunities.  It is improving, becoming more viable and profitable.<\/p> <p>  Based on the presentations the committee has heard to date, we want to identify the key issues of which we believe the Members of the Oireachtas should take hold.  First is the need to establish a forum on the future of banking in Ireland.  Banking is viable.  There are State-owned banks, there foreign banks and there banking institutions that are merging towards profitability.  There is a great deal of change in the industry.  Our concern is that each institution is considering its own set of circumstances and not factoring in the role of banking in Irish society, the impact on rural Ireland and the impact on staff and customers to the extent that we believe it should.  We believe a strategy for banking should be given guidelines through some type of forum to set out for all banking institutions what would be required of an ethical banking industry which must be viable and profitable and at the same time cognisant of its role in the economy.  We have set out in our submission the kind of issues that forum should address: what kind of banking sector does the Irish economy need and want; how best to deal with State-owned banks; how to encourage a level playing field, particularly for those institutions that are part of banking now that are not regulated; how to address the best interests of customers, staff and communities in the context of the changing of banking; how to meet the challenge in the industry and how to create first-class employment for our employees.  We have no particular view on how this should take place but it should involve stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  The second plank of our approach is sustaining branches in the community, which this committee is very focused on.  There have been 160 branch closures since 2008.  All banks have indicated that they are reviewing the essence of banking into the future.  We argue very strongly that there is a need for banking institutions in communities.  There also needs to be a strategy for banking as part of a rural Ireland strategy.  Oireachtas Members have developed a rural Ireland strategy and financial institutions should be part of that.<\/p> <p>  We have set out an eight-point plan focusing on issues such as one financial institution being required to have a presence in every town.  There should be a six-month moratorium before any branch is closed.  That should be done by an independent expert or ombudsman who needs to challenge the bank on the rationale, engage with stakeholders to provide alternatives.  We need to consider alternatives.  Elsewhere in Europe and the rest of the world, there are alternative models - such as mobile units - where there are no branches.  What tends to happen is that banks announce closures and only because of responses from us or customers are these issues addressed.  The staff agenda should also be addressed.  We have agreements with all institutions to the effect that there should be no compulsory redundancies but people will be transferred or relocated.  That should be endorsed and be part of any strategy.<\/p> <p>  The third area we focus on is the culture in banking.  In our submission to the banking inquiry we said this was one of the major factors in the malaise in banking in the past.  We have identified the kind of changes needed to change the culture, starting with the composition of boards which do not have employee or customer representatives, the regulator is not a member of the boards.  A more diverse board structure will help the governance of banks to achieve some of their objectives.  The measurement of banks' success needs to focus not just on short-termism, maximising shareholder value or profitability but on long-term sustainability and customer service.  We recognise that banks need to be viable and profitable but these are not incongruous ideas.  Third, we need a pay strategy.  We are not convinced that lifting caps on senior executives' pay or incentive schemes will do anything to improve the direction of the industry.  Linking senior executives' pay to incentives caused the calamitous problems we experienced.  Pay should be based on customer service, education and the performance of the organisation in terms of the service it provides to the community.  We need to address the problems that front-line staff have because of inadequate staffing and stress in the industry.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is a significant breakdown in trust in our industry between senior management and staff and in particular because of the fear permeating the industry which makes change very difficult.  Staff are afraid to address and highlight difficulties.  These are some of the areas we identified.<\/p> <p>  We have been involved in securing modest pay increases over the past few years but there is a huge gap between the pay levels at the top of the organisation and those at the bottom.  A senior executive earns a minimum of 65 times more than a junior staff member who earns &euro;23,000 a year.  It is an enormous gap.  There is still a focus on performance-related pay.<\/p><p>We believe that looking at staff performance based on sales targets is not conducive to a good environment to work in.  If the industry is going to be successful, we need to invest in staff development and training and building on their skills and having them involved in local community bankers.  Our members are prepared to participate in this but the focus in the industry is still on performance-related pay.  We need to address, in a structured way, how somebody progresses from the bottom to the top of the scale.  In some banks, if the bank gets its way, it takes 35 years for somebody to progress from a junior point of the scale to the top of the scale.  It is ridiculous.  Prior to the crisis, 12 or 14 years was a reasonable time for progression.  These are things that need to be addressed.<\/p><p> We then focus on outsourcing.  Our view in the past has been that outsourcing has been a recipe for disaster for the industry.  There is evidence of that.  I refer the committee to the RBS outsourcing of Ulster Bank's information technology function.  Had there not been a branch network, the impact on the Irish economy for Ulster Bank customers would have been disastrous.  AIB and some of the other banks have outsourced recently.  While we are not convinced it is the route to go, as part of that outsourcing there was a commitment that this work would be retained in Ireland.  We are genuinely concerned because there is a second phase going on now in which these new companies that are coming in with outsourced work are talking about offshoring that work outside of Ireland.  That is not in the interest of our members, the community or the taxpayers and has implications for the economy as a whole.  The Central Bank has a role in this but it has to be more vigorous in ensuring and looking at propositions.  We are totally opposed to offshoring.  We are particularly conscious of the implication for our members in terms of employment.<\/p><p> We are as alarmed as is everybody else about the development that has taken place in the tracker mortgage debacle.  It is our view that the Central Bank investigation should have happened a lot earlier.  No guidelines were set out for institutions when the challenge in respect of tracker mortgages was brought in.  There must be a very clear guideline from the Central Bank on what should happen when people move within variable rates and fixed rates.  In the absence of that, particular banks and institutions take particular decisions.  It is complex because of legal contracts that emerge.  We are certainly all for a system that talks about redress but we are not convinced that everybody has signed up to that redress.  If they have, they should be communicated with and supported.  The work the committee has done on this has been significant.  We also believe there should be internal mechanisms of appeal because there is still a challenge going on there.  Is what is being provided under the redress scheme fair and reasonable to the customer?  What is the notion of a prevailing rate that will apply in the context of a solution to the problem?  Nobody seems to be in a position to answer that.<\/p><p> We are concerned about the role of vulture funds in the industry.  They have come in in number of areas in terms of lending and taking over non-performing loans, NPLs, which are difficult loans.  Our concern is that much of the time they are not regulated.  We have all seen the implications they have for the industry in terms of how they deal with customers.  There are non-profit organisations that can manage non-performing loans for the banks in a cost-effective fashion.  It may take a bit more time to address.  The banks are dealing with pressure from Frankfurt to get such loans off their books in the interest of improving capital but there needs to be a balance here.  The Oireachtas could play a role in challenging and looking at alternatives rather than the willy-nilly approach of each bank moving to a quick exodus in terms of the non-performing loans.  <\/p><p> On the sale of AIB, as we stated previously, the Oireachtas and politicians need to question what will be done and what is the best value for the taxpayer of State-owned banks.  If the decision is to sell, it should be transparent.  From our perspective, if that is the decision, the terms and conditions of our members and pensioners should be protected, as well as their pensions and pension funds, as happened when that took place in Bank of Ireland.  We are concerned in that context that these issues are not on the agenda and need to be addressed into the future.  <\/p><p> Finally, the impact of Brexit will be the biggest challenge this country will face both in the Republic of Ireland and by our colleagues in Northern Ireland as well.  We are unique as a union that has representation in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We submitted a similar paper to our colleagues and all the politicians in Northern Ireland about the future of their industry.  If there is going to be an opportunity to bring jobs here it should not be at the expense of jobs in London, Belfast or Northern Ireland.  We need to be conscious of that.  If jobs are to brought in, it should be done on the basis of value jobs and not on the basis of looking at cheap opportunities to maximise opportunities on a low-cost model.  We are working with the banks and the committee to ensure that what emerges from that is very close.    <\/p><p> The banks have appeared before the committee to talk about various strategies and we believe the committee has a unique opportunity as this industry is changing and the taxpayers helped out all of the banks.  There is an opportunity with the announcement that KBC will remain in Ireland.  The commitment of AIB to get back into profitability is very clear.  Bank of Ireland will undoubtedly reach profit again and in the next number of days will announce a profit.  Ulster Bank is back in profitability.  There is a great opportunity to influence the banking institutions if members take it.  They will listen to central direction.  In the past, by being local and by focusing on local issues, we have all been bypassed.  If some of these thoughts are taken on board and delivered, there will be opportunities to maximise influence in the industry into the future.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Broderick for his presentation.  One of the major focuses of the Financial Services Union is on the culture of banking and how bad it was before the crash.  Mr. Broderick had made seven very good suggestions in this regard.  Does Mr. Broderick see evidence of any backsliding towards old habits returning?  I have heard of one bank in particular making some very worrying moves such as halving the risk support manager role and getting rid of the team leader in each branch.  The team leader was in charge of the control compliance and auditing, which is a role that was brought in as a response to the 2008 crash.  The work of the team leader has been dumped, it would appear, onto the bank management, which is already overworked.  The branch manager is judged by sales, which means there is a direct conflict of interest in his or her role in control compliance on the one hand and generating more and possibly riskier sales on the other hand.  Does that sound familiar to Mr. Broderick?  Would he consider such moves as a backward step?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#D00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487692800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am familiar with what the Senator is talking about.  We have challenged that decision from a negotiating position in that bank as part of our process.  Across the industry, we want to sit down to talk about what is the competency to do roles, what is in the best interest of the customer, as well as the institution going forward and what is the opportunity for there to be maximum staff in a location.  In many cases there is not adequate staff in a changed environment.  We share the Senator's concerns.  The problem is these institutions see themselves as to some extent omnipotent and self-absorbed.  Unless we go down the route of industrial action, they are concerning developments and it is difficult to mount industrial action against those kinds of issues.  In fairness other institutions are a bit more sensitive to the role and are engaging with us.  We want to try to develop a standard in the industry whereby those conversations can be had and that we go to the highest-level standard.  My concern is that if those practices become embedded, every other institution will say that competitively they need to do similar things.  We also believe the Central Bank has a role in this.  Sometimes we are disappointed in that the Central Bank seems to take a view that developments like this are an operational issue.  Particularly where risk is concerned, we think it is central to that.  The Central Bank has made it clear to us that it does not intend to involve itself in industrial relations issues but these are broader than industrial relations issues.  There needs to be an overseer, such as the committee, to talk about values or appropriate structures.  They are things that can be looked at to build within the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has a role to play in monitoring this, particularly if there are issues raised by us or the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>The danger is that we backslide to exactly where we were before the crash.

There is a huge amount of regulation coming from Frankfurt, which is focusing on enhancing capital in the banks.  The banks' strategy is very much geared towards addressing capital issues at the expense of everything else.  Going back to our idea of the forum, we need to challenge Frankfurt.  Do we have to capitalise ourself to the extent that short-term decisions are made to maximise capital which impacts on customer services and creates short-term changes in the industry?<\/p><p>That is the Frankfurt perspective.<\/p><p> With regard to probity and regulation generally, there is a considerable amount of regulation in the industry.  It could be argued it is over-regulated.  I do not believe one can ever over-regulate but there is a great deal of paper regulation.  The core of the question concerns whether the regulation is fit for purpose.  We believe there needs to be proper testing and evaluation in this regard.  In the area of grandfathering, which involved an alleviation for senior staff in the industry in the past who were not involved in lending, the regulator is saying all such measures have to be regulated again.  That is a conversation that needs to be had.  The consequences, if the implementation were willy-nilly, would be that there would be no jobs for these people in the industry.  Conversations on this are needed.<\/p><p> The Central Bank has a role in regard to regulation.  It is stronger than it was before.  To return to the earlier point on operational issues, the banks' use of cost-income ratio as a justification for action has to be balanced against regulation generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>With regard to some of the more recent scandals, such as those over tracker mortgages and higher interest rates and even some of the decisions taken on the arrears cases, we see a lot of consumer-led action and then political action.

Does Mr. Broderick believe a potential whistleblower within the bank has the legal protection necessary to speak out?

Does that concern Mr. Broderick?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#E00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487692800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I will make three points to address that.  I highlighted that fear is the main impediment to whistleblowing in our industry, irrespective of legal protection.  It is absolutely constant.  If a person is in a small branch - he or she does not know whether it will operate or function - having whistleblower protection will not help that person secure an alternative job or help him or her when that person is told he or she could be identified.  The industry has experienced enormous change.  While there is whistleblowing legislation in place which protects bank officials the same as everyone else, the fear is inordinate.

This relates to the power of the institutions.  Prior to the crisis, one bank said it was the best regulated and financed bank in the world.  It ended up in a huge mess.  Nobody challenged that.  Therefore, a mechanism is required to challenge some of these statements.  This is why we believe the forum could be of value.<\/p> <p>  A difficulty is that the members, no more than ourselves, are dealing with each institution in its own right.  Bank of Ireland is independent and AIB is State owned.  Permanent TSB is majority State owned and KBC is a foreign bank.  Ulster Bank will refer to RBS on an ongoing basis.  We need to have interaction not only with local management but with other managements across the board.  We have this regularly.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct that there is legislation, but unless the issue of fear is addressed, bank officials will not speak out.  There is this ongoing conflict and that is why we are very insistent that in all procedures in banks regarding discipline and grievance, there has to be external oversight.  Our concern is that the banks and many employers will want an internal mechanism to deal with issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Coming from a rural area, I share Mr. Broderick's concerns on rural banking, in particular, and the social and economic exclusion owing to the technology within the banks.

There are some banks, however, that are very insistent that there is only one solution.  Regrettably, on many of our campaigns we have not been successful.  The banks just went ahead with what they had proposed, leaving us all to deal with the consequences.  This is why, in our paper, we suggest a moratorium of perhaps six months and an independent overviewer.  It would stop all of us having to chase our tails for three months.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, there could be valid reasons for proceeding in a certain way.  If the industry could commit to making sure there is at least one financial institution - I do not mean a post office or credit union, although there is a role for these - it would be beneficial.  I refer to an institution that could lend to local businesses and engage in the local community.  These are challenges.  They will not be solved through legislation but it would be useful if we could impress upon the institutions the need to meet customer need, commit to the economy and acknowledge corporate social responsibility.  In the two bigger banks, I have noted a far greater understanding of the need to progress in this regard.  That probably is based on the fact that there is State involvement.  One or two other banks are not in that place so we need to bring to the highest level what we can do to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>It is particularly the case since people cannot now get through to their local branch.

The Chairman said the forum is a good idea.  If the industry is invited to attend, I would be amazed if it chose not to participate, particularly in light of the political circumstances we are faced with.  The question of whether it would participate fully and seek to embrace what we all want to achieve is a separate one.  I genuinely believe there is an opportunity for such a request to be made to the industry.  I think it will participate.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for all of us is to get the banks, particularly the State-owned banks, to recognise that the taxpayer is in control and should have some influence.  Nobody is saying the banks should not remain profitable and viable.  We are proposing to change the model so it meets everybody's needs.  If a branch with one teller and four machines on the side of the wall has a queue going out the door, what else will customers do other then migrate to one of the machines?  Stressed and pressurised customers who are doing their best to make their lodgments will not choose to wait half an hour in the midst of this madness.  The banks are probably correct when they say there has been a migration to digital banking.  We have to recognise that banking is changing all around us.  There are different models that can address customer needs.  One of those models can involve banks being open in local communities and being available to senior citizens.  Such a model that can involve elements of the digital approach.  There can be a combination of both approaches.  Our paper refers to examples across Europe that show how this can be done.  Ireland is not that different.  There is no doubt that there has been some migration.  The banks use terms like \"5% footprint\" because they are driving the footprint away.  That is not addressing the needs of customers.  Our experience has been that if customers are asked what they want, they will say they want somebody to do business with.  It is easier to do business with somebody locally than to go through options Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the telephone.  This has to be taken to one side in all of these developments.  That is why we are suggesting alternatives to branch closures, for example.  How are those alternatives addressed?  What is the best way to meet customer needs?  We need to look at alternatives to politicians, trade union personnel and local activists going into banks in Dublin or Belfast and saying \"please do not close this branch\".  As the committee will have heard in some of the representations that have been made to it, the strategic approach that is needed should involve looking at different models rather than necessarily going down the route of further closures.  Such an approach will open a welcome debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#G02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I would like to ask Mr. Broderick about how the tracker mortgage issue emerged.

What tends to happen is that this is centrally referred to the legal department and then a letter is pre-printed or pre-sent out to the customer to address that.  It is likely that a bank official would not be aware of something like this until a customer expresses dissatisfaction or raises an interest, or until it has an impact on the official himself or herself.  That is how these things tend to operate.  That brings me back to the question of whether the 2008 regulation described how a tracker or fixed-rate product should be phased out and the circumstances in which this should be done.  We would have thought the Central Bank would have had rules in this regard, for example setting out whether a similar product should be made available if a certain product was not on offer.  I do not think such a regime was in place at the time.  This problem was compounded when everybody looked at their legal contracts.  Some contracts gave banks the right to do what they wanted and other contracts were very much in favour of customers.  We are still in the debate about what the prevailing rate actually was and what that meant.  There is a misconception that every customer has gone back to the tracker he or she was on many years ago.  As we know, that is not what is happening.  As the terms of most of these products are pre-structured and based on legal contracts, and therefore dealt with in that way, officials are often unaware of them until complaints arise and have to be dealt with.  Indeed, that was done.  Members may recall what happened in one bank where there was a lot of noise in this regard.  It travelled into other institutions as it emerged over time.  Many of our members are customers of a certain bank and are therefore facing this exact issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#G03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The issue, as we discussed it with the bankers and as we are discussing it with today's witnesses, is that it looked like a cartel-type activity.

It is oriented around legal contracts and legal interpretation.  In many cases, customers accepted the outputs at the time as being beyond challenge.  I think this has only changed since the Central Bank has come in.  This is why we have suggested that perhaps there needs to be an interim report from the Central Bank giving a heads-up.

The banks will be under pressure on the capital side to release those non-performing loans as soon as possible.  This goes back to all the contradictions with which we are dealing.  If we are going to deal with silos of banking, we will have capital doing one thing and individual institutions doing their own thing.

There are representatives of State-owned bodies on the boards of State-owned banks at the moment and they have not caused difficulties.  We are saying that if one wants a better balance and the corporate responsibility of a broader, more diverse board, we must factor in how one maximises the opportunity for the employer or the shareholder.  However, the board must also be sensitive to other groups as part of this process.  An enlightened board with staff representatives, a regulator in attendance and a customer point of view will help inform banks to come to a decision.  None of these people will say that the banks should be out of business or there should be a branch in every location in the country.  These are not the kinds of people who will be on these boards.  They will be responsible people seeking a balance.  There is value in that.  Equally, the forum creates guidelines.  Every employer will do what it must based on its short-term needs or its shareholders' needs.  However, it makes a difference if one starts identifying one's corporate social responsibility, how one can do things a little differently and how one can gauge a little more to achieve that change in a more engaging way with customers, employees and other such people.  To be fair, I think some of the banks, in their strategies for the future, are beginning to recognise this.  They are sitting down with us as a union and saying they will not close all branches and asking how they can do things a little differently.  This is an opportune time.  Very importantly, if we do not create some kind of forum, every bank will be very focused on its own little objective, and the Irish taxpayer and our local communities will be left out there.  However, if a forum can be created whereby one can have conversations and reconcile the need for organisations to remain independent and have their own objectives - some of these banks are State-owned - one can at least create a value proposition that people might look up to.

I think it will consider selling them at a time when it thinks it will get good value, presumably the best value return for the shareholder.

Has there been a change in direction that has taken more on board the needs of the customers and the taxpayer?  Probably not.  The culture has been very focused on getting the banks back into profit and getting them out of State ownership.  There is a balancing act in this regard.  The challenge I am throwing out to the politicians is that they need to decide what they want out of their State involvement in the banking industry.  If it is about maximising the return of capital for the State, the question is how one can influence, while the banks are in State ownership, a better banking environment, a better banking model and a better banking value that allows for profit, a changing model and digitalisation but also factors in politicians' needs and the economy's needs.  This has been lacking and there has been a reluctance in this regard.  I can understand it because the culture has been so focused on trying to put the capital in and save the banks.  We do not need to go over the history of the industry and the huge amount of moneys involved.  I put the question: what is the strategy?  If it is to maximise capital, to what extent can the members use their bargaining position at this point in time to influence a more sensitive - as the Chairman said, perhaps a more compassionate - industry that can still be profitable and maximise profit, but not at the expense of everybody, and can do business more sensitively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Larry Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Broderick believe that State ownership in the long term would be a good thing or that it should be in the fullness of time wound down?

Smaller locations will involve some advisory and technology work.  There will be other areas where there may not be a presence, so there will have to be a community or mobile bank.  It is changing and we are embracing that change.  We will have to recognise that.  This is not a bleat about things not changing.  We absolutely understand that is the nature of the work.

It is about balance.<\/p> <p>  At the moment our members are caught not knowing what the future will be.  They are trying to deal with change and pressure, but there is no support in place.

I find them offensive, difficult in terms of how people with the demands that are being made and I think somebody has to stand up against the attempts by the banks to chase customers and harass them to the extent that they fall into poor health and other consequences.

The legislation is in place, unfortunately, in my opinion the legislation is not worth the paper it is written on because it does not offer the protection that is necessary and therefore there is an onus on the unions.  The unions have a major challenge in taking on board the issues raised by employees in banks who become whistleblowers.  I know there are issues that need to be brought to the fore to have the individual who raised the matter protected.  It is hard to achieve that balance.

That thanks is on behalf of the thousands of people across Ireland who have been affected by what in my world has been called the tracker debacle.  It has affected customers across all lenders.  Within that confirmed fact lies a clear indication that this matter and how it came about was based on deliberate actions between each of the lenders.  I will tell the committee how this occurred and why and to put across the customer's viewpoint.<\/p> <p>  I believe before we go forward we must look back.  An infamous advertisement ran in 2006.<\/p><p>It showed a guy on a bus saying that he did not know what a tracker mortgage was.  A product originally introduced by Bank of Scotland, it tracked the ECB base rate at a certain margin above.  Within that lie the causes and results of what happened.  It tracked the ECB rate, but the banks borrowed on the interbank money market of Euribor.  They were aligned at the outset, but the issues started and banks panicked when they became unaligned.<br\/><br\/>I know what a tracker mortgage is.  This issue first rose in 2009.  To understand what a tracker mortgage is, my submission includes definitions and understandings from every bank.  A common theme runs through each.  For AIB, it is for the life of the loan.  For Bank of Ireland, it is for the term of the loan.  For PTSB, it is during the term of the loan.  For EBS, it is for the term of the loan.  For Ulster Bank, it is guaranteed for the life of the loan.  KBC guarantees to track to ECB reference rate.  For First Active, the interest rate will never be higher than a certain margin.<br\/><br\/>From these definitions, what the product was - what people signed up to - was clear.  For a long time, I have argued that the variable bases of those loans were established when the people commenced them.<br\/><br\/>Regarding what went wrong with the product, the alignment of Euribor and the ECB changed dramatically in mid-2008.  The ECB reached a peak of 4.25%, the banking collapse that became known as the financial crisis occurred and banks suddenly panicked.  I am certain that high-level meetings were held in each bank to address the issue.  I know of no lender that has admitted to this or made available the minutes to any such meeting, but it is clear that meetings would have had to have occurred.  Then the messing with customers' accounts began.  For example, PTSB came up with the idea of getting customers to break from their fixed rates and subsequently denying them a return to trackers because they broke from those fixed rates.  In some cases, EBS decided not to offer the rate at all and see what happened.  Bank of Ireland tried the same line, namely, that it did not do tracker mortgages anymore, so tough luck.  KBC tried to claim that, since one of the forms that customers signed included the phrase &quot;thereafter reverting to a standard variable rate&quot;, it would discount any customers returning to their trackers.  KBC did not even have a standard variable rate mortgage when people were fixing loan rates.  All home loans reverted to trackers, as the infamous e-mail claimed.  AIB has tried every excuse to get out of trackers.<br\/><br\/>In one of the decisions in which I was involved, however, the Financial Services Ombudsman decided that the underlying contractual position of the variable basis of the loan was clearly set out at the commencement of the loan and was not altered in the customer selecting a fixed period.  Astonishingly, this was not challenged in any court.  Of the cases that I have won through the Ombudsman's office, not one has been challenged to the High Court.  Every one of them was accepted.<br\/><br\/>The answer to the question of what would have happened had no banking issues arisen in 2008 is clear.  The conditions that everyone signed up to did what they said on the tin, as the saying goes.  The margin was for the life of the loan.  According to the banks in their various replies that I have received over the years, the customers were meant to be the legal, financial and banking experts in understanding their documentation.  However, the contracts were clear.  All that differed in each was the margin above the ECB rate that was allocated to loans based on various reasons, for example, loan-to-value ratios and the percentages that would have been borrowed against those ratios.  The only reason any of this changed was because of the banking difficulties that arose from mid-2008 onwards.<br\/><br\/>I am at this meeting to discuss the customers of all banks whom I have met since 2009.  The purpose is to tell the committee the effect on those people and, more importantly, their families.  I have met hundreds of these customers across all lenders.  The impact of the banks' actions have been catastrophic, especially on families and children.<br\/><br\/>Members are aware from some of the lenders that the banks' actions have resulted in the loss of homes.  However, what needs to be examined in this context is the number of customers who have had any type of loss of ownership.  The only numbers put forward by the banks to date are those that can be classified as homes lost, which suits the banks perfectly because it keeps the number small, but there is no difference if a home is sold to trade down to meet the overcharging or to emigrate, if a property abroad is sold to help meet the payments or if a property is voluntarily sold to avoid the inevitable happening, that being, emptying all of a customer's savings first, then asking friends and parents for help, approaching the credit union for a short-term loan, running up debts on cards and current accounts to their max to meet the payments and, if all of that was not enough, going into arrears.<br\/><br\/>Homes are not all that have been lost in this debacle.  Lives have been lost, and most people affected have had their lives and outlooks changed.  These lenders have used our &quot;Irishness&quot; against us.  By that, I mean that the desire of Irish people to own a home and put down roots is fundamental to our make-up.  To attack that section of their customer base is appalling behaviour.  In the majority of cases, customers have done everything possible to avoid going into arrears on their homes.  Add in the unique economic circumstances that prevailed at the time and what was created by the banks' actions was the perfect storm.<br\/><br\/>That the lenders set about deliberately attacking and robbing home owners - essentially amateur investors - is truly appalling.  There are unwritten rules in place that are not covered by any consumer protection code, law or directive but are sacrosanct when it comes to being a home owner.  Banks should be able to be trusted in how they deal with home owners especially.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, I wrote a piece at 6.30 a.m. one morning when I got up, entitled &quot;Why is the customer always wrong?&quot;  I will read it into the record:<\/p><blockquote>I cannot understand the continual erosion of a time sound basis of business namely the customer is always right to one now where the customer is always wrong.<br \/><br \/>The acceptance as a requirement by these lenders of time as the important ingredient as well as cheap capital in order to restore their basis of becoming pillar banks but to then use the very opposite weapons namely no time or cheap rate to help their customers recover is wholly unfair that it has been allowed to happen.<br \/><br \/>But the cunningness of how it has been done to include our Government and the Central Bank as co-perpetrators of these actions is unacceptable.<br \/><br \/>It is clearly obvious to me that far from becoming pillar banks that will support our economy there is only one requirement for the heads of all lenders and this is to squeeze the customers to the very limit of what they can get away with because in the new financial world within Ireland the customer is always wrong.<\/blockquote><p>I am here today to say that the customers are not wrong and were never wrong.<br\/><br\/>I commend the customers who challenged these lenders.  It was no easy journey for anyone.  I know first hand what it takes to take on these lenders with their power, might and financial strength.  I stated this in 2009, but no one listened.  It is now 2017 and we still have the same problems.  I challenged my first tracker case in 2009.  Since then, I have been challenging lenders, initially through the processes of the Financial Services Ombudsman, culminating in getting the matter to the Central Bank industry-wide investigation.  One would think that, at this stage, the banks would accept that their game and trickery are up and that each has been caught, but not a bit of it.  I want to state on the record that there is not one morsel of regret within any bank that I have encountered for what they have done.  Their only regret is that they have been caught.<br\/><br\/>One must remember that, until August 2015 for PTSB and August 2016 onwards for the other lenders, each customer affected by this tracker issue believed it was his or her own fault.  Customers blamed themselves for buying that nicer home, for trading up and keeping the existing home as an investment or for having to borrow so much money to even get on the ladder.  It was all their own fault.  These became known as the Celtic tiger fools.  It seems conveniently forgotten that the levels of stamp duty, VAT and fees that contributed to the finances of the State were enormous.<br\/><br\/>I wish to address some words towards the Central Bank.  I want it noted on record that I support and acknowledge the efforts that the Central Bank is making in this investigation.  While accepting that the Central Bank might have arrived to the matter somewhat later than was ideal, it must nonetheless be acknowledged that it has arrived with its investigation.  Currently, there is an enforcement investigation into PTSB and Ulster Bank and an industry-wide tracker investigation across all lenders.  The difficulty for the Central Bank is that it cannot make any statement of note other than updates until the investigation is complete.<br\/><br\/>I disagreed with the treatment that the Governor, Professor Philip Lane, received at his most recent appearance before this committee.  The Governor and the Central Bank have not taken one cent from any customer.  The banks did.  I would ask this committee and indeed all who are affected to place a degree of trust in our Central Bank to do its job as I do, but it must be allowed the time to complete its work.  I accept the difficulties that the waiting is causing to the families and individuals affected.  For that, the lenders should be ashamed.<br\/><br\/>The lenders' current CEOs are holding the reins of responsibility for how their banks are behaving.  I cannot and will not accept the reply of &quot;I was not there when this occurred.&quot;  The legacy of this issue is being written as each day passes, but the word &quot;apology&quot; is being used without the support of any degree of true remorse.  There is still a level of resistance within each lender to correct the matter fully.<\/p><p>I am still being told on a daily basis that I am wrong.  Each lender is attempting to tell me I am wrong about a matter that is within the banks' own documentation.  I challenge the CEO of each bank to take full control of and responsibility for the investigation and to put the customer first and the bank second.<\/p><p> I have been in financial services for over 33 years and I am appalled at the level of wrong done to customers by the banks.  I have heard the heads of some of the banks come into this room and give this committee details of the number of accounts affected.  Everything is scripted to perfection to ensure that nothing wrong is said.  That caution and care reflects the fact that the banks are concerned to ensure that they do not cause further damage to themselves.  Each of these banks has made provisions without any degree of knowledge of the harm their actions have caused.  I have spoken to thousands of customers and the level of hurt the banks have caused is truly appalling and I am certain that each lender has no real sense or understanding of this.<\/p><p> I am mindful today of the people who have met me to tell me their story.  I mention in particular the brave couple who took the matter to the High Court at enormous cost to themselves and their family, both health wise and financially.  They won their case in court only to be redressed by PTSB with a margin of 3.25%, which was never allowed for and their fight continues today.  I think also of the lady who felt humiliated when she had to leave her Christmas shopping trolley behind, four days before Christmas, who was being overcharged by &euro;1,000 per month at the time.  I think of the man who was only able to meet with me because the rope snapped when he attempted to take his own life, the man who had to take a back office position in a bank for fitness and probity reasons and the man who could not accept his redress cheque as he had no bank account after losing his home.  I am mindful also of the many couples who have split up and the effects of that on their children, the many families who have had to emigrate and the people who had their homes and properties taken from them illegally.  The list goes on and on - 15,000 times or more.  I cannot forget and I must applaud the sacrifices made by the parents of many affected customers who, while their children were being deliberately overcharged by banks, assisted them with payments to meet their loans.  Ironically, some of these parents had lost their entire life savings because of the fall in share value in these banks.<\/p><p> The economic circumstances at the time represented a perfect storm for the affected customers and their families.  It is a truly appalling and horrific what these lenders have done to customers.  The customers and their families did nothing wrong.  I get angry when I hear the replies from these lenders who appear to have not one morsel of regret.  I made a commitment to all of the customers that engaged with me that I would go shoulder to shoulder with them, wherever that journey takes us.  I will continue to do so until I am proved right, whether through this investigation, the redress process, the ombudsman, the Irish courts or the European courts.  Giving each customer the opportunity to draw a line under this sorry matter should have been the desired outcome from the very outset.  Issues within families, relationships and careers, ill-health, shame, isolation and social exclusion are but a few of the effects I have encountered in my dealings with customers.  No bank has escaped in this debacle.  When one realises that it should never have occurred, one begins to realise the tragedy of the whole matter.  Life will go on for sure but the scars will remain with people for ever.  To delay that healing process will be a continuation of the wrong doing.<\/p><p> The banks should refer to the numbers of people affected.  If they do not do so, this committee must find out why.  This is not just about the accounts that are affected.  It is about the sanctity of the family home which has been attacked by our banks, in direct contravention of Article 40 of our Constitution.  It is also about the malignant effect the banks' behaviour has had on the social fabric.  It has resulted in death, separation, divorce, family breakdown and ill health.  The family is also protected in our Constitution under Article 41.  The banks have attacked customers, their families and their homes.  It is claimed that 15,000 accounts are affected but up to 500,000 people could be affected by this debacle, directly or indirectly.  A willingness to borrow and an eagerness to lend was always a recipe for disaster.  This disaster occurred because our banks made credit too easily available and tried to get their customers and the State to pay for their mistakes.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.

There is an issue here that has been forgotten.  When people set out to purchase a home they know that they have to pay their debts.  That is the tragedy here because people would have done everything they could to prioritise the retention of their homes.  That point is missed in this whole debacle.  People sold their cars, they got loans from credit unions and did everything they could to pay their mortgages.  In terms of the appeals that I am currently bringing to PTSB, for example, I have referred to the isolation and social exclusion that occurred.<\/p><p>It is an aspect of the results of the banks' actions that is not appreciated.  I had an example of a case of a religious family, not a Catholic family.  It is enshrined in their ethos that they have to pay back money borrowed.  In their case, the interest rate was increased wrongly and, because they missed their payments, they were ostracised within their religious community.  Recently, I got a man to send me photographs of his unfinished home to highlight the cause and effects of his bank's actions.  He did not want to send them to me initially.  The reason I needed them was to show the lack of any work done on the house for nine years.  The point I was making was the impression this community had of that family and the children in it.  It was still a builder's finish nine years later because the family did not have a penny to wallpaper or put curtains up, paint the house or put down a driveway.  The community's impression of that family, which does not realise the bank is overcharging them over &euro;1,000 a month, is there forevermore.

It is an easy argument.  One is either entitled or not entitled to a tracker mortgage and one's margin is defined.  The investigation in a collective is an easy argument.  However, I am concerned the reason it has taken so much time is because the banks are creating lines of defence rather than resolutions.  I have seen it in some of the resistance I am meeting with cases which have come back.  Some of them are incorrect.  I do not know why it is taking the time it is.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank told each bank that as soon as it identified a customer affected, it was to put the customer back on the correct rate.  I said a long time ago all affected customers should all be put back on the correct rates and we can sort all the other stuff out afterwards.  The banks must stop the overcharging.  I put it to the Central Bank that it had to stop the offender offending.  That is the critical aspect.  The minute that would be done, at least the overcharging would stop.<\/p> <p>  When people get the cheques, three emotions arise.  The first is delight because some of these people did not know it was happening.  The second emotion happens within the minute, namely, anger.  The third emotion is the what if.  As I have said on a broader scale, the opportunity to deleverage this economy has passed us by with a low interest rate environment by the banks overcharging.  It has to spread across the standard variable rate issue.<\/p> <p>  By the way, I do not buy the lack of being able to repossess houses.  Every one of the banks has boasted about their profit levels, to a degree, to this committee.  Lazarus could not have recovered as quick.  There is only one person creating profits, the customer.  One factors in the perfect storm.  How many rejected direct debits happened in this country?  That is &euro;10 a go.  There might have been &euro;300 in the account but the &euro;10 was charged when the direct debit was bounced.  The retrieval of current accounts by banks is presented to committees like this as new lending.  When a bank takes away a current account from somebody, it takes away not just the current account but the confidence to transact business.  The banks have done this across the board and I am now moving to broader banking issues.<\/p> <p>  The elephant in the room is commercial mortgages.  If the banks attack the most vulnerable of families, I dread to think what went on on the commercial side.  I already have had a contact from London about an Irish international bank.  It told a commercial customer to give up its tracker mortgage or it would lose its credit facilities.  There are 15 cases of this with the lowest loan size at &euro;8 million.  Where does it end?  I do not know.  We could go back to the sanctity of what is the family and get it right.

Astonishingly, the staff are afraid of their lives of losing their jobs if they raise this issue.  Every one of these cases is still not resolved.  This bank did not just do this to families because it did it to its own staff.  I have told all of the staff who contacted me about this not to engage me because I am fearful it could result in the loss of their jobs.  I know the responsibility that is on my shoulders.

The Central Bank's statement indicates a figure of 8,200 accounts or customers, and there is a big difference between the two.

The figures are unknown because while the argument is clear, the lines of discussion are very varied, and it is now a case of who will and who will not get their trackers back.  To take the example of AIB, no customers prior to March 2006 are currently getting their tracker mortgages back with that bank because it did not update their terms and conditions until March or April 2006.  What I find astonishing about that, and we are getting into the meat of a particular case, is that the bank did not decide on 1 March to change its view of a tracker mortgage and to reprint every relevant piece of documentation.  It just decided to update the documentation.  The definition of AIB's understanding of a tracker mortgage is set out in the new conditions, and in respect of those cases, they are all going back to tracker mortgages, but the bank claims that the cases that were written prior to the documentation being updated are not entitled to do that.  I thought it was the easier argument originally because there are two methods of interest in that documentation, which is variable and fixed, the variable being a tracker.  However, that option appeared to have disappeared if a customer decided to fix their mortgage for a period, but where did that option disappear to?  The more important question is why the bank did not tell any of its customers that this option was going to disappear, because I have not met one who was told about that, and I have spoken to more than 1,000 people at this stage.  I begin to think at what point the banks' stance on this appears foolish.<br\/><br\/>However, in terms of the numbers, I do not know how many are affected.  It is approaching levels now where it is such a serious number and we need to take account of any customers who fixed their mortgage rates during the period.  We must remember why they decided to fix their mortgage.  Between 2006 and 2007, there were six consecutive increases by the European Central Bank, ECB.  Therefore, people were panicking because there were rumours that the ECB rate could go to 6% or 7% and the banks' margins had to be added to that.  The opposite is now happening.  The ECB rate is now at 0%, so the banks are stepping into the space of trying to make attempts to increase their margins, so there is same argument again.  First, it was people panicking to get fixed mortgage rates.  Now because the ECB rate is low, the banks are saying a 3.25% rate is acceptable.  What is astonishing about that is that each bank, when underwriting these tracker mortgages, stressed the loan, an element which makes sure that the customers can afford the loan, and the margins used in the stressing element are 2.75%.  The banks have used their own rules and put on a margin above what they felt the stressing element was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1487692800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I will come back to the rates issue, but is it Mr. Kissane's view that the official figures put out by the Central Bank and the banks are still understating the problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017022100002#O00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487692800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Yes.

Therefore, what was the tracker rate?  What is astonishing is that, if we take the example of the one that is the furthest along the lines of the challenge on the margin issue, I have cases in my office with no margin.  What the banks representatives claimed here in this committee room was they had two tracker products, they had the stated margin product and the non-stated margin product in 2016.

It would have the financial might, the legal expertise and the finances to take it wherever it goes and defend it to the hilt.

The tragedy of all this is that all of these customers, up to the investigation beginning, have believed this is their own fault and of their own making, that they were the fools who went and bought the nicer home or retained a first home to have it as a pension supplement later on in life.  Up to the point where they find out that there was a tracker issue in the first place, they were to blame for everything.  One can imagine, if one introduces financial stress into a family home, it brings with it a myriad of related issues - the blame game, the effects on relationships, the effects on children.

A 12 year old got the whole issue of the appalling behaviour of what has gone on.<br\/><br\/>If I am wrong, then fine.  I know I am not wrong.  I have checked it.  I have read it.

The consumer protection codes are there.  If there are 20,000 people who fixed, lost or whatever without being told by the bank the consequences of their actions, the 2006 consumer protection code states that one cannot diminish, disguise or obscure important information.

Everything else is variable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the ECB.<br\/><br\/>It brings me to the issue of the prevailing rate.  It is a disgrace for a bank to attempt to take one word from 14 pages of documentation and that is the reason the customers are not entitled to revert to tracker.  Now the onus of responsibility lies on the customers.  They will be blame the customers, stating that the customers did not read their documentation and that it says, on page 4, &quot;the prevailing&quot;.

People may well try to escalate it.  I believe it would slow the matter at present.  It has to be acknowledged that progress is being made, but at such a slow pace.  If one is overcharged by &euro;500 or &euro;600 a month - it is going on now six years - to pay &euro;600 of an overpayment one has to earn &euro;1,200.

It is a perfect storm for the economy in terms of the businesses that are failing because of overcharging, the lack of availability of credit and the people who are going into arrears.  It goes back to Deputy Michael McGrath's issue, which is that they are now essentially bank locked.  That is the difficulty.  There is a 3.25% and 3.67% margin issue.  All these customers are bank-locked because they cannot move anywhere.  It would be very easy to resolve.  I made myself available to each of the banks.  KBC is the only one that has not met me.  It told me if it needed to meet me after the investigation it would.  All of the other banks have met me.  In November 2015, one of the main banks denied that anybody was going back to tracker mortgages but four months later, it made a provision of over &euro;140 million.  Why did it change in three months?  The bank knew exactly where it was going because there had been 400 or 500 people working on the project for two years at that point.  I have concerns.

I can tell the committee for certain today that I do not have one because I can see through them.  I only engage people where I know there is a case.  I had a win percentage level in the ombudsman's office of 76% when the average upholds were between 10% and 12%.  It is not because Padraic Kissane is a walking genius but because I knew how to present a case.  The question I had was how did I lose 24% because I did not bring a case unless I had one?

This is because when a number of customers are unified, everything that has happened to each of the customers can be corralled into the same reply.

These are the same banks that caused this problem in the first place.  Are we to expect that they have gone from sinners to sainthood and they are going to be helpful?  My issue with the position on the Central Bank is that it stood by when all of this was going on.  I do not accept that a new Governor or new person in a job cannot be blamed chastised or interrogated on the basis of what is happening in the Central Bank.  It is not about the person; it is about the Governor of the bank.  It is about what the Governor is doing and what he is empowered to do.  In my estimation it is no defence of the Central Bank to say someone new is in place.  In my estimation, as I said the last day, the Central Bank is afraid of the banks.<\/p> <p>  The unions were before the committee earlier.  Their representatives were telling us that their employees are afraid to deal with some of the issues in the bank.  I realise that is not why you are here today, Mr. Kissane.

We could not add up the figures that were being presented to us.  That is the kernel of the issue.  I admire the work Mr. Kissane does and his presentation today has been significant.  Bearing in mind what he said about the Central Bank, he has said that if there was an inquiry, he would stand up and say that he was prepared to tell the whole truth.

I read a case, Bogdan Matei and Ioana Ofelia Matei <i>v<\/i>. SC Volksbank Romania SA, that was heard by the European Court of Justice a number of years ago.  The court found that, if the increasing nature of a variable rate mortgage was not clearly identified, the contract was voided.  It was an astonishing decision that we would use in court.  The banks probably never believed that, from 2009, I would get the matter to this point.  Now that I am starting to unify more customers, the banks are growing more nervous.

I have with me a folder of amazing facts from my investigation.  Some are astonishing.  No bank in Ireland has ever advised any customer in respect of his or her mortgage.  Every day banks tell me that they did not advise a single customer and that the customers made their own decisions.  A reason for this is that, if they did advise, they would then have a fiduciary duty of care.  By Irish law, banks have no fiduciary duty of care to their customers.  It is astonishing.  However, I was in a queue in a bank a number of months ago and I saw an advert: &quot;Looking for some financial advice?  Book an appointment with us.&quot;  The same bank is writing to me saying that it gives no advice on mortgages.<br\/><br\/>Some of the documentation involved in a fixed rate mortgage was described in a Financial Services Ombudsman's decision as misleading, vague, imprecise and confusing.  The bank never challenged that in court.  I referred to KBC's fixed rate applications.  Similar to AIB, KBC'S application may have been out of date and was not updated to account for the tracker aspect of the loan.  It was KBC's get-out-of-jail-free card <i>per se<\/i>.  Tricks are being played with loans that should have been clear.<br\/><br\/>Requests for interest-only extensions are a regular occurrence.  Given the economic environment, people lost their jobs and overtime and bonuses and many issues arose.  They approached their banks for interest-only extensions.  This was another opportunity that the banks used to remove people's tracker rates.  PTSB offered a 10% bonus if people paid off their trackers early.  Bank of Ireland conducted market research into people&rsquo;s worries about increasing rates and presented it as an opportunity to fix their mortgages at the low rates of the time.<br\/><br\/>There was an issue with the Central Bank, which brings me back to certain concerns.  Investors with 20-year loans had those loans underwritten and granted on the basis of there being interest-only periods of ten years.  When their interest-only terms expired, it was used as a reason to lose a tracker because the investors had changed the conditions of the loan even though the loans had been underwritten as interest only at the time.  The banks assumed that the values of the properties would increase.  Mr. Justice Hogan stated in one of his decisions that how the banks had played tricks with the documentation would have been a unique argument from his lecture students.<br\/><br\/>I witnessed a lady crying in the Court of Appeal one day.  My heart went out to her.  She had won her case in the High Court but the bank challenged it to the Court of Appeal.  The decision was set aside.  When I saw her leaving the court, I wondered what would happen to her now.  I do not know what happened with the costs.  I did not even ask.<br\/><br\/>I referred to the stress testing effects.  A 12 year old wrote to me on behalf of his mom and dad.  It was astonishing, but his letter should be read.  It is not that any of this is untrue.  He is an astonishing young man who gave a statement.  His name is Kyle, and he wrote at the bottom of his two-page note how he could not understand why, because the bank made a big mistake, his parents should have anything to do with it, that the bank had ruined his and his sister&rsquo;s childhoods and that it was not fair.  This is truly appalling.<br\/><br\/>Banks can line up their legal experts, but they have no moral defence.  I will challenge any of them.  There are good people in these banks, but many are being told to shut up and not to reply in a certain way.  In one reply that I received from a bank, I saw documentation where I know that information was withdrawn.  Whatever people do, they are not to respond to my commentary on anything relating to tracker mortgages.  They must respond to what the customer said and should not include me.  The issue goes to the appeals panel, which is then meant to try to assess the matter.  This is astonishing.

I do not have the resources to get that level of insight, although I probably will eventually.  One issue of concern is the restoration of accounts that moved banks, and should be put back to the tracker rate.  That is posing an enormous difficulty.  There is the absolutely ludicrous situation that if one wants an account to be restored to the bank as a result of an appeal, it can be restored it to the bank.  The bank will have calculated a rough estimate of what the overpaid interest is.  However, to get that loan restored, the appeal must be accepted.  That disallows any further appeal from being brought, even to the courts.  It is astonishing.  <\/p> <p>  I can certainly make the members aware of some of the harder questions that should be asked.  It is not easy to come in here and raise these the issues.  I would rather it never happened.  However, if the banks think I am going away, I can tell them I am not.  I am absolutely committed to my clients.  I said I would go shoulder to shoulder with them all the way.  Some have been my clients since 2012.  I have not enriched myself from this.  People may wonder how much I am making from this.  Many of my clients do not have any money, so I do not take any payment from them.  The banks should pay me for everything that I have done.  The clients should not pay me one cent.  It was agreed that my conditions to do with engagement would be honoured by AIB but it has rowed back on that as well.

I am not going to rehearse that argument but I have specific questions for all three bodies represented.  I am concerned that the second phase of inclusions into rent pressure zones has left many areas out.  It does not include anywhere in Waterford or a significant amount of the commuter belt in Meath, Louth etc.  I have three specific questions.<\/p> <p>  I would like witnesses to explain to us the rationale behind the criteria, both the requirement for the rent in the designated area to be above the Statewide average and the logic of the 7% increase in four of the previous six quarters.  Where did this come from?  Why was this chosen?  Many of us worry that it is going to be quite exclusive.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that the areas can only be designated according to legislation for local electoral areas, LEAs, or county council areas.  This is a particular problem in Waterford, for example, whereas if one went down to district electoral divisions, DEDs, or small area statistics - for which we should have the data - there could be a much more refined system.  Why were DEDs or small areas not included?  Is there consideration of those?  None of that should be taken as me supporting the policy but if the witnesses really looked at those criteria and areas of application, more people could be included in this, albeit a very weak measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#B00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the way decisions on the rent pressure zones are made.  I have specific questions if I may put them to the people present.  I have spoken to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Housing Agency, the Minister's office and many other people.  I remain unconvinced that the statistics are accurate.<\/p><p>I will put my question in the form of a fact.  I thank the Housing Agency for releasing to me the document given to it by Louth County Council without question.  The document clearly states, on rent pressure zones, that there is a lack of available property to rent in County Louth and it has driven the cost of rents up, particularly in Drogheda and Dundalk.  On the matter of supply of private rental properties, there are a number of properties currently advertised.  The rents vary from &euro;1,000 for a two-bedroom terraced house to &euro;2,000 for a five-bed house and &euro;1,400 for a three-bed house.  These rents are not sustainable or affordable for the vast majority of people.  The evidence that was given about the process by the council was that there were unsustainable and unaffordable rent increases.  That document was not passed on past the Housing Agency.  I am not being personally critical of anybody but it was not passed on.  Therefore the argument that Louth County Council is making and I as a public representative am making about the rent pressure zones is that they are not taking into account actual rents or the views of the local authorities.<\/p><p>The other key point is this.  The two parameters were that one had to have an increase over four of the six preceding months.  The increase in rent in Louth, and certainly Drogheda, was greater than the national average in six out of six quarters.  Rents are out of control there.<\/p><p>The other issue is that poverty-proofing was not taken into account in the formula.  If the housing assistance payments are the key criteria for families with lower incomes, why was it not taken into account that housing assistant payments in County Louth and Drogheda in particular are higher than all other areas in the country, including a significant number of these rent pressure zones?  The formula benefits the landlord but does not benefit the poorer person.<\/p><p>At the very core and heart of the witnesses' decision-making is the involvement of <i>daft.ie<\/i>, on which I cast absolutely no aspersions.  It is a professional organisation for which an eminent academic works.  How accurate are the rents that it puts on its web pages?  I believe that those figures are not accurate.  That is what landlords say they are asking, but what landlords demand is many times higher than that.  I have evidence from my constituents that there are under-the-counter payments to landlords, that rent has an official value, but there is competition among tenants based on under-the-table payments to the landlord.  How can the system be made fairer?  Would it not be more reasonable to look at the housing assistance payments, HAP, rather than what <i>daft.ie<\/i>says the rents are?  HAP is the true payment, and the true support, particularly for poorer families.  These are the people who are suffering the most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#B00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I have some questions about the methodologies used.

That was a hard-fought fight and was well worth doing at the end of the day.  Within that, and within my own constituency in Wicklow, we are seeing anomalies arising almost immediately with the methodology that is used.  I will use Greystones as one example.  Rental increases in Greystones probably began in 2013 and peaked in late 2014, and have not hit that 7% over a full period of inflation over the last six periods, so it rules itself out, yet Greystones and the Kilcoole area have probably the highest rental prices in Wicklow, comparable with most of Dublin.

The case must be made as to whether this should be looked at on a town basis as opposed to a local area basis.  Perhaps if the Department could comment on those two specific items.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd made the interesting point that Louth local authority made a submission.

According to Focus Ireland, one in three tenants struggles to pay rent every month, and one in nine is worried about losing his or her home.  That shows us that this threat is right across a range of incomes.  It affects not only the most vulnerable people who are on rent allowance, but also is a real threat to the security of families across a whole range of incomes.  Have rents been increased deliberately by landlords in anticipation of the rent pressure zone legislation?  It increased faster in the last quarter than at any time.  Rents have actually gone up 50% since Fine Gael took power, over this Government and the previous Government.  That is an incredible figure and it speaks volumes.  <\/p> <p>  I too have questions on how the zones are designated.  One has to wait until it is over a number of quarters.  Looking at Limerick, rents went up by 12.5% last year but not over long enough of a period.  It is as if we are waiting for cities and towns to reach the Dublin crisis before we intervene.  It is completely wrong and I have said this since the time of the legislation.  <\/p> <p>  My substantive question is about policing of the new regulations.  How can we tell if landlords are complying with the rent review period and the rent increase limits?  When the changes were brought in at Christmas we argued in an amendment that a landlord should have to produce a certificate from the RTB showing the tenant what the rent was.  It is impossible for tenants to know if landlords are complying with this legislation, and there is no in-built policing in it.  Ms Rosalind Carroll from the RTB confirmed recently at a housing conference that the board is not notified of rent increases.  The records only show what the rent was at the start of the tenancy.  The RTB does not know what the rents are at the end.  How do we know that a landlord is going to comply with the 4% limit?  There is such competition for accommodation that a tenant will not question a landlord.  I have serious question marks over how this will be implemented.  If the RTB does not know what the actual rent on a tenancy was when the previous tenant moved out, how can it know if landlords are complying and how is a tenant supposed to know if a landlord is telling the truth when he or she makes the legal declaration to the tenant?  Is it likely that tenants are likely to query such a statement, given that they are in a queue to get accommodation?  The chief executive officer of Focus Ireland, Mr. Mike Allen, has pointed out that many agencies have already heard of landlords simply ignoring the 4%.  How is this to be monitored?<\/p> <p>  If it is so easy for landlords to break the 4% cap, does that not create an incentive to evict sitting tenants and get new tenants in?  I am not confident that this will stop the dubious evictions.  We tabled a Bill in respect of this issue during January.<\/p> <p>  On pages ten to 11 of the document, the prospect of identifying public land to sell to developers to build private rented accommodation is discussed.  The sell-off of public lands is a major problem in my opinion.  As new landlords do not have to comply with the 4%, will the new landlords on these RPZs, to which the witnesses advocate the land be handed over, be obliged to comply or will the sky be the limit for them?  Has a problem been created there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#C00500","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Are there plans in the future to review the criteria where local areas will qualify to be in a rent pressure zone?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that from this initiative, 178,000 people now have security for the next three years and know exactly what they will be paying.  I know that what is being attempted here is a very delicate balance and we need many answers to be teased out here today.  Notwithstanding that, the security that we have given those people on foot of the actions that this committee assisted with before Christmas will benefit those families and will give them security of tenure for the next three years.  That is important to note.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like to know what is the long-term strategy for the sector and how we can ensure that landlords do not leave the rental sector because supply is a massive part of this.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin and many others questioned the rationale behind the criteria we have.  The rationale for the RPZs was set out quite clearly in the strategy, and the key point is that rapidly increasing rental inflation is the most significant challenge facing the sector.  Ultimately the solution is to be found in increasing the supply of rental properties.  While the supply is coming on stream, it is very important that we have a targeted, time-bound and transparent policy response.  The rent predictability measure is targeted and time bound in order to alleviate the pressure while new supply comes on stream.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rationale for the 7%, the measure targets areas where rents are rising rapidly and are unsustainable.  We were legislating at a time when the average national rent was increasing by 9%.  A 7% increase is seen as unsustainable.<\/p><p>Similarly, the rise had to be consistent over time.  <\/p><p> Areas were chosen where the rents were already high, that is, above the national average and where the rents had consistently been rising rapidly over the period of the previous six quarters.

The additional rent pressure zones orders were made in January to bring in the additional areas.<\/p><p> It is very early days.  Ms Carroll and Mr. Silke might discuss in more detail the process that was involved but, in fairness, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has done a huge amount of work in a very short period of time to assemble the data and be able to do the kind of analysis that allowed the Minister to designate 12 additional local areas and examine 15 others against the criteria in the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>In terms of the availability of the data, is it technologically possible to look at district electoral divisions, DEDs, or small areas?

The methodology for this is very complicated.  Originally, when we did the rent index it was always based on national data, Dublin data and outside of Dublin data so in a very short space of time we have had to be able to analyse our data at a much more granular level than we had done previously.  That meant we had to review our methodology with the ESRI.  We use a hedonic regression methodology, which essentially means that we can look at the property characteristics.  When we look at data currently we might see simple averages, and there is no weighting in them for a one-bedroom, two-bedroom or three-bedroom house.  What we needed to do was analyse whether there were enough data within the local electoral area, LEA, level to be able to say whether there was a sufficient population size within that area to allow us make any proper and substantive analysis that we could stand over.  We have done that at LEA level.  We do that by building up from an electoral district, ED, level but we would have to do further testing in terms of methodology to see if there was enough of a sound population size across the country to bring it down to ED level.

It was very clear during the debates in the D&aacute;il that that was the intention of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  We will be reviewing the entire criteria but even before that the Housing Agency, and Mr. Silke may wish to speak about this later, has a function to monitor the rents on an ongoing basis and as each new quarter arrives, there will be new data.

The key point is that we have quite a number of provisions in the Act to ensure that the tenant is fully informed of what is happening.  The landlord is required to give a notice of new rent in writing and include information on the dispute resolution procedure.  The tenant is told that if they are not happy with the rent set it is open to them to refer the dispute to the RTB.  The landlord must provide detail on three other dwellings and, in the case of a new tenancy, the landlord has to provide the tenant with details of the previous rent so the tenant can do his or her own calculation to see whether the rent is in compliance.  The RTB services are available to both landlords and tenants to inform them as to how the procedures are working but it would not be appropriate for the RTB to be policing it in the sense of being judge and jury.  The RTB is an independent body.<\/p> <p>  The most effective way to ensure that the procedures are not abused is to empower tenants, and landlords, by giving them as much information, training and details on their rights and the rules.  We acknowledge that it is quite complex but on that basis, the RTB is working towards providing more information and developing a one-stop shop where there will be a portal for landlords and tenants to get that information.  Rather than having anybody policing externally, the most effective policing of it will be empowered tenants who know their rights and who can challenge landlords when they are abusing the process.  In fairness, most landlords want to obey the law and they need support also in terms of being given information on the requirements, how to calculate the rent due and so on.  We are committed to doing that.<\/p> <p>  On the question of evictions, there are many provisions in place to prevent evictions.<\/p> <p>  On the long-term vision for the rental sector, currently, we have social rental and private rental but for the rental market to function effectively in the longer term we believe we need to develop a not-for-profit rental sector and one of the actions in the strategy is to put together an expert group to examine the issue of cost rental.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that acknowledges that other European countries that have socially progressive and inclusive housing systems have a sector which provides rental accommodation to low-income families at rents which are below market rate.  In the medium term, we would like to develop that kind of middle sector in the rental market, which would have the effect of moderating and stabilising rents in the longer term because the provisions we have now, the rent pressure zones, are short-term, time-bound, targeted provisions to address rapidly rising rents but structural reform is needed in the longer term.

Once the Housing Agency makes a referral, it goes to the Minister.  The Minster then must refer it to the RTB for us to look at it.  We either confirm that it meets the criteria or that it does not.  There is no discretion on the formula.  The issue of the formula, where the increase must be over 7% in four quarters, is defined in legislation.  There is no discretion in terms of whether something does or does not meet the formula.  It also has to relate back to our last published rent index, which in this case was the third quarter of 2016, and it is this which we would have been referring to.  In spite of the fact that Drogheda was not referred to the RTB, I can tell the Deputy that it would not have met the criteria.  The average rent in terms of our rent index was &euro;909.  It would have had to have been more than &euro;973 to meet the criteria.  It was a bit out.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd asked about methodology.  We have now published that on our website and all the reports are on the website.  We are trying to be as transparent as we can with the data.<\/p> <p>  It is not a simple average, so it will take account of the types of properties in the area and it also looks at new rents only.  Deputy Coppinger mentioned earlier that our existing rents data is not often updated because landlords do not telephone us and tell us every time they review a rent.  Therefore, the data that we use to inform our analysis are the new registrations in that particular quarter.  We had across the country just over than 30,000 new registrations for the third quarter and that is what we would have based our analysis on.  Our next rent index is due to come out on the week of 20 March.  We are pushing to be more transparent with our data.  Up until this point, we only ever had data for Dublin and outside of Dublin.  We will be trying to publish more of the local electoral areas, LEA, data, as time goes on.<\/p><p>All of this has happened at quite a pace and how much of that I get to will depend.

The process is set down clearly.  The Housing Agency has to consult with the local authority concerned but the Housing Agency then makes its independent judgment as to what area is put forward to the Minister and then the Minister must refer the areas on to the RTB.  The RTB's function is simply to do the calculation and see whether the area meets the criteria, which are set down in the legislation.

One principal point where Ms Nic Aongusa is absolutely wrong, with respect, is that the facts were not presented to the Minister because the Minister, in the case of County Louth, did not see the documentation even though it met at least one of the criteria but he saw at least one other area that met none of the criteria.

That is merely a fact.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the rents, part of the problem is that if I am renting a flat in Drogheda, Dundalk or Ardee, what happens is the landlord tells me that he or she is putting up my rent, for example, by &euro;200 a month, and I can take it or leave it.  Unfortunately, the tenant has to take it because there are no other houses.  There is no other supply.  The Department talks about the increasing supply.  There is no supply.  There is nothing coming on the market and therefore, rents are going ever upwards.  That is the problem in County Louth.  There is no supply.  There is increasing demand.  There is massive exploitation of tenants in rent increases.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the Department might want to wait until June to review this damn thing.  That is far too long.  Ms Nic Aongusa states it is six months.  It is six months of hell for those who cannot get a place and if they are renting a place, they will be thrown out of it.  They are living in fear.  They are coming into my office - I do not know about that of my colleague here from Wicklow - in fear.  They do not know what to do.<\/p> <p>  On the core of the issue, I will ask a direct question.  If the Government, in its wisdom, decides to increase housing assistance payments, HAPs, for poor families, should that be a criterion?  In other words, the greater housing assistance payment for the category of person should be included in the assessment of whether it should be a rent pressure zone because by increasing the support for poor families, the Department is accepting that these have a greater need, they cannot afford the rents and the Department is giving them a greater subsidy.  Should that not be part of the formula?  Should that not change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#F01200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Casey wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#F01300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I will not go back into all of the details.

The Deputy made a reference to <i>daft.ie<\/i>, but it is probably the same issue for us also.  There is some protection within the law so if a dispute is referred to us we would use the rent as it is on the tenancy agreement.  A landlord cannot suddenly claim that the rent they put in at &euro;700 was actually &euro;900.  Landlords put themselves at risk during any potential disputes.  If rent arrears were owed to them, for example, the rent arrears would only be calculated on the basis of the tenancy agreement rent.<br\/><br\/>The legislation also allows us to award damages of up to &euro;20,000 when a case comes before us that is found to be not in accordance with the law.  I accept that it is not always incentivised for landlords to register the rent, but there are a number of protections within the law.  Reference was made to education and awareness and these protections are part of the information we try to tell people about.  We are spending more time ensuring that tenants are aware of their rights, and that landlords are also aware of those rights.  We are aware that some landlords inadvertently apply the wrong rents.  We are trying to reach one fifth of the population to tell them about all the new regulations that have come in.  One of the elements we have put up onto the website is a rent calculator.  As members are aware, the formula to calculate rent can be quite complicated to operate so the website allows a person to look up to see if they are in a local electoral area that is a rent pressure zone.  Many people do not know what side of the line they are on, and so on.  Landlords or tenants can find this out straight away on the website.  They can also check what a 4% increase calculates up to on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis since the last rent review period.  That facility is there for any landlord or tenant to check if the increase is being applied correctly.  They can print this off and attach it to the rent review.  The rent review notice is now prescribed by law and a landlord must explain to a tenant how the rent has been calculated.  We have created this tool so they can print the calculation and the tenant can see it has come from our website.  All of this should help with people's knowledge and also help with tenants needing to know if the calculation is correct because they can check it on our website.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Coppinger asked some questions earlier and it will be useful to back through them.  She asked about policing and compliance.  The Residential Tenancies Board does not have a policing role.  Our remit has not changed under the legislation.  We do not have powers of investigation.  Our powers are quasi-judicial in that we are there to replace the courts.  When a case comes through us, it must be done through a dispute process.  The issue of the &euro;20,000 award or the risk of arrears is the real policing part of that.  It is worth pointing out that I have just checked our statistics prior to this meeting, and since 24 December we have had a 135% increase in cases referred to us on rent related matters.  This shows that people are using the disputes process.  Many have not come all the way through our system yet.  Of the cases that have come through, generally they were rent reviews that imposed on people before they should have been.  There is a 24-month period during which a landlord cannot serve more than one rent review.  In these cases, the landlord has tried to increase rents - perhaps because of the new rent regulations coming in.  Of the cases we have heard so far, we have found that the majority of the rent review notices have been invalid and the findings have been in favour of the tenants in those cases.  We are actively dealing with those issues as they come through.  Our timeline for dealing with those issues in mediation at the moment is five weeks.  We are getting through cases for adjudication in 12 weeks.  Our adjudication process involves an evidence-based system whereas our mediation is all about coming to agreement and so on.  Clearly, for this issue it may be an evidenced based system.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of one-stop-shops we are trying to work towards our second quarter deadline of having a one-stop shop in place.  The form it will take will be in trying to make our online facilities more navigable and more user friendly for the public.  Since the rental strategy was published, our daily call rate has increased from 600 calls per day to 900.  This is a huge increase and it shows the demand for information within the area.  We also want to look at support services with web chat facilities available and, looking at the demographic of our tenants, they tend to be younger they like to do things online via the web.  For our landlord cohort, which tends to be slightly older, we are also looking at extending our phone line hours.  We have a traditional public service by phone from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  We want to see if we can be more public friendly in stretching that out.  We are working towards these measures and the re-launch of our website will take some work, so we are working towards the second quarter deadline.  In the meantime, we are trying to keep up with our call pace as it comes in at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487674800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>For the avoidance of doubt, there was some discussion as to whether or not <i>daft.ie<\/i>data is included in the formula and to be absolutely clear, the<i>daft.ie<\/i>data is not used in the formula and there is no reference to the <i>daft.ie<\/i>data in the legislation.

As my colleague, Ms Nic Aongusa, highlighted, our Department has been engaging with a number of local authorities in the Dublin area for some time, prior to the development of the rental strategy, with a view to identifying sites that have capability of delivering extra supply more generally and for the rental sector specifically.  From our engagement with Dublin City Council alone, we are very confident that the 1,000 units which were indicated in the rental strategy for progression in January and can and will be developed once the relevant masterplanning, development, consent, planning permission, procurement and delivery actions are secured.  We are making good progress on that front.  For example, in the O'Devaney Gardens regeneration project alone, there is very close, almost fortnightly, engagement between the Department's officials and Dublin City Council's officials - indeed, they are combined on a joint project board - to develop a mixed tenure housing project inclusive of both new rental accommodation, social housing and so on, which will deliver probably in excess of 700 homes, in that strategic and regenerating part of the city with a view to starting dates of, I suppose, 2017 into 2018.  <\/p> <p>  That is not the only project.  Running closely in tandem with the O'Devaney Gardens project is the wider Dublin City Council residential lands initiative which, as members may be aware, includes sites at Oscar Traynor Road, potential sites in St. Michael's Estate and others which are well able to deliver the balance of 1,000 units identified in the rental strategy.  We are very confident about the availability of sites capable of delivering the 1,000 units identified in the rental strategy.  That is not at issue at all.  We are very focused on the wider wave of supply, particularly in regard to potential rental sector specific developments both on other local authority lands and privately owned lands.  There are local authority masterplanning exercises under way on, for example, sites in Corkagh Grange in the South Dublin County Council area, Donabate in the Fingal County Council area and we have other potential candidate sites in that context.  Rental supply will be a very strong possibility within that.  <\/p> <p>  Within Dublin city centre, where there is acute pressure in the rental sector, we have 500 apartments under construction on a mix of development sites in the docklands area, in particular.<\/p><p>It is very visible there with projects such as Capital Dock, Dublin Landings and so on.<\/p><p> Members will also be aware that over 3,000 units are proposed for the Poolbeg west strategic development zone planning scheme which is out for public consultation at the moment.  It is very likely that a considerable amount of the product on that site will be for the rental sector.  Major development works have commenced on the Cherrywood strategic development zone.  The town centre element of that will probably Ireland's biggest and first build-to-rent project with more than 1,300 units.  These are all physical manifestations of the Rebuilding Ireland initiative and the actions taking place under the rental strand of that are actually having an effect on the ground.<\/p><p> Within the wider whole of Government approach as published on the Rebuilding Ireland website, action is under way to secure early delivery of 23 major urban housing development sites, MUHDS - I will let members pronounce the acronym themselves.  Additional rental sector supply is therefore very likely over the short to medium term, as evidenced, for example, in the recent sharp increase in the number of active sites recorded by the Dublin housing supply and co-ordination taskforce.  We have some preliminary figures that have not yet been published.  At the last interval we had 126 active sites producing about 4,000 to 4,500 homes in the Dublin area alone.  That has jumped quite significantly to 145 in the last quarter of 2016, which reflects a broader buoyancy regarding patterns of planning applications, commencements and so on, particularly for apartment developments for which viability seems to be recovering quite strongly now, particularly in the high-demand locations.<\/p><p> As the Minister and officials have said, in the context of dealing with the various different strands of our current housing difficulties, boosting supply is at the core of solving the problem in the long run.  It is coming on stream.  We have also had a very significant increase in overall completions in 2016 compared with previous years.  We have also had a very significant increase in overall completions in 2016 compared with previous years.  Our sense would be that we are on track to achieve the target of 25,000 homes by 2020 or 2021 in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  We have more to come on that with the local infrastructure housing activation funding.  These are all strands of Rebuilding Ireland in which the team in the Department is heavily engaged at the moment, as are the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I am more interested in the review process at this stage.

There are huge resources in land that the State owns but is not necessarily owned by individual Departments.  We need to get that land on stream with public private partnerships for fixed-cost builds.  We should offer, for example, 50 acres of land and service it if the price of the house is under a certain amount.

The 4% rent cap will not apply to new developments in an area, for example, or to units that have been substantially refurbished.  The Housing Agency will examine the overall rent levels, and the market rent being charged for exempt properties, as well as the effect of the rent cap and conduct an overall assessment.  It is early days and we will look to see how the measure is being implemented.  The review will be completed in June.  We will consult stakeholders and take into account this and other discussions and we will examine all the various procedures.  We expect this to be a relatively short review and then we will report to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  We have spent a great deal of time talking about the detailed process for the RPZs but looking at the big picture, the Minister and the Government has always been clear that supply is at the heart of this issue and, ultimately, the best way to ensure a functioning, viable, sustainable rental market is to have sufficient supply and to try to develop the structure of the market in order that we have a segment where there is rental property available for people at non-market rents and to develop the not-for-profit sector for middle income earners and younger, more mobile workers to enable that part of the market.  There is no ideal measure and we are willing to review this and learn.<\/p> <p>  We also need to take into account that this is a significant intervention in the rental market.  Imposing rent regulation is a big step and we need to be careful always to protect against a flight from the market by investors.  This is why we have been careful with the criteria and why we have been clear about how this needs to be transparent, objective and evidence-based.  We need to be absolutely on our guard that there are not unforeseen consequences such as investors not wanting to invest or landlords selling up and getting out of the rental market because the priority is a viable, functioning rental market.  That is the big picture behind these measures.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about what we are doing about standards of rented accommodation.  That is an important issue going forward.  There is a section in the rental strategy about standards in private rented accommodation and we have reviewed the standards regulations and brought them into line with modern requirements.  The Minister signed them in January and they will take effect at the beginning of July.  The responsibility for the inspection of rental properties in the private rented sector and ensuring compliance rests with local authorities.  One of our objectives in the rental strategy is to increase the number of inspections and to strengthen the enforcement of standards.  We are conscious that a review was published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, on the performance of local authorities in carrying out these functions during 2014 and its findings highlighted a low rate of compliance and a lack of consistency of approach across the local authorities in conducting inspections.  Our plan is to develop guidelines, which we will send to local authorities before the second quarter and before the new regulations come into force to help address NOAC's findings and facilitate standardisation of approach and procedures for inspection and enforcement.  We will also engage with local authorities to agree targets to increase the number of properties they inspect and the way in which they inspect them.  The strategy sets a target of 25% of all private rented accommodation to be inspected annually.  Currently, it is approximately 10% and it is much lower in some areas.  That target is our objective and, in their feedback, the local authorities said they are happy to work with us on that basis.<\/p> <p>  We will seek specific ring-fenced funding to enable local authorities to increase their inspection teams and to roll out a more joined-up approach and a standardised framework nationally for inspections going forward.  We will also work with them to see if we can develop a shared service function around this.  Local authorities could either set up a national office or even engage in regional co-operation to pool their resources to develop the inspection function.  Some local authorities are effective.  Dublin City Council, for example, has been a leader in this regard.  Its officials conducted many inspections in 2014 and the standard of accommodation has improved.  A great deal of substandard and poor quality accommodation has been taken out of the system as a result of the regulations and we want to continue to build on this.  We are clear that there will not be a lowering of basic quality standards at a time of housing crisis.  That is another important pillar of the strategy.<\/p> <p>  We have spent a great deal of time talking about RPZs, which comes under the heading, \"Security\", but the strategy contains other measures relating to security.  There is a section on services, which deals primarily with the services the RTB can provide to both landlords and tenants.  We also talked about supply and standards.  Those four areas are equally important when looking at the big picture in the rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017022100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I welcome the Department's contribution.

We are well advanced on changes to the exempted development regulations that the Minister may make - obviously, with Oireachtas approval - relating to the conversion of commercial properties into residential uses.

There can be a number of regulatory requirements associated with conversions such as planning permission, fire safety certificates, building control and disabled access.  There are other complications as well if the matter involves protected structures.  That is our contribution on the planning side in the Department to reducing the regulatory burden because from a planning policy point of view, we are trying to get the lights back on in our high streets and the centres of our cities, towns and villages.  From a planning policy point of view, there is no objection in principle to getting these premises into residential use.

The Minister has recently been talking about that.  It will be rolled out nationally.  This scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford to access funding required to bring them up to standard for rental property.  The cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority and the approved housing body and the houses are then leased for a period to be used for social housing, which will alleviate the pressure on the rental market generally.  There is also a buy and renew scheme whereby the Department makes funding available to local authorities to buy up vacant properties and make them available for social housing.  Similarly, under Rebuilding Ireland, the Housing Agency has a fund of &euro;70 million to buy vacant properties from the portfolios of banks, discussions have started with them and contracts have been signed to bring over 200 properties on board as well.<\/p> <p>  Very often, discussion takes place about whether the fair deal scheme is a factor in vacant properties.  We have been working with the Housing Agency, to whose national vacant house reuse strategy Mr. Silke referred, and have commenced an engagement with the Department of Health about the terms of the fair deal scheme - the rules it has regarding the financial assessment of income from rental where the owner of the property is in a nursing home - to see whether there is scope for amending the financial assessment rules to enable more properties that might be lying vacant as a result of their owners being in nursing homes to be brought back into use in the rental sector or for sale in the market.  Obviously, this would be a matter for the Minister for Health to determine at the end of the day.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey asked about the inspection of rental properties and why the Department could not go for the 100% target.  Ultimately, it comes down to resources.  It has been a recurring theme for us over the past couple of years.  During the years when there was very little activity in housing in local authorities, the housing departments and inspection departments lost a lot of their capacity so it is a question of building up capacity.  We are starting from a very low base.  If we get to 25% by 2020, that will mean that every rented property will be inspected at least once every four years.  Once we get to that, we might be able to look at increasing the target.  Ultimately, it is down to resources.

People are very vulnerable, can be extremely unwell and isolated and feel under huge pressure.  I would be concerned about that process notwithstanding the fact that there could be incentives if they wish.  It is a significant issue.  I want the Department to look at vacant non-principal private residences around the country, particularly in rent pressure zones.  In the case of vacant non-principal private residences within a rent pressure zone, one is not putting somebody out of their home, taking the property from them or wrongly putting pressure on them when they are, by definition, extremely ill.  This is the wrong way to go.  I want to be very clear on that.

This is a highly complex situation in which some of these vacant properties will need disability access certification and fire certification.  I do not know whether these authorised certifiers will sign off specifically in respect of fire because when one is renovating or retrofitting buildings, one does not use standard materials.  Inventive solutions are sometimes found and some of the materials used would not be certified from a fire rating perspective.  Will an authorised certifier to sign off on this or will we end up in a quandary?

Of the roughly 25,000 people, we do not how many might still have a partner or family member in the house.  Obviously, we would not go near that.  I presume it would not be compulsory for people to rent out their homes and that the option would merely be made available to them if they wanted it.

The building standards area already affords building control officers some discretion, but the degree to which that is used consistently among officers is something we need to look at and bolster, be that through further guidance, support structures, training or something else.<\/p><p>It is important that there is a whole-of-system approach to finding creative solutions in order to get disused commercial properties into residential use.

There has been some interaction between those organisations on whether there are impediments in respect of apartment developments.  In the city centre proper, particularly in the Docklands area, a combination of various different things have moved the viability point of city centre apartment developments from a marginal position to a reasonably viable position in recent months.  These include what we are doing in the context of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy, what we did in the context of the Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply package before that, the standardisation of approaches to apartment standards, the development contribution rebate scheme and changes to Part V.<\/p> <p>  There is a difficulty in peripheral locations where the cost of financing an apartment development for a build-to-sell as opposed to a build-to-rent model can pose certain challenges.  As members of the committee will be aware, one is all in from the start when developing an apartment scheme.  It has to be built out to the end.  It is not like building houses where ten can be built, sold and the cash turned over.  It is a much more straightforward proposition from a development finance perspective.  One could be down &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million before getting the first sales back from an apartment scheme, which can take time.  It can happen over a very short period where there is very strong demand.  It can take longer to sell when one is competing with other conventional housing products.  There are a number of issues there.  That is an area on which we will have further engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Finance, with NAMA and with the local authorities, to see what further steps we can take.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the broader point around planning policy and meeting current housing needs, we have very clear choices available on how we meet that need now and over the next decade or more, as the Minister's initiative in Ireland 2040 has indicated.  We have to try to secure more compact, sustainable urban development.  That includes the efficient use of urban land, increasing densities or more compact development generally.

In the rental market and anecdotally, we are seeing some impact on supply from rent regulation.  I do not think that the plight of tenants can be disentangled from that of landlords because both are needed for the relationship to exist.  Some of the measures that have come in do not necessarily take into account that there are people charging rents below market rates and so on.  There are issues for some landlords in the market.  Not every landlord is charging to excess.  When we are looking at the longer term plans and the review in June, we need to start thinking about certainty within the market.  Whatever tweaking that we might think about doing, we need to provide some level of certainty to investors.  Research we carried out in 2014 showed that most landlords at the time had mortgages.  Their rental income did not cover mortgage repayments.  While the rental market has increased in some areas, we are still 7% below peak rates outside of Dublin and that has to be taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>  It is important that everybody knows where we are going, that there is a sense of direction about policy and that we are going to bring some certainty to the market.

One key point is that the Apollo House occupation showed me that we have to look at empty commercial properties in our major urban areas that will never be used again for commercial purposes.  I know that Apollo House is separate because it is going to be demolished.  Such properties could be in former port areas.  We all know that those areas have been blighted for perhaps ten or 15 years.  We need to fast-track the capacity to occupy empty commercial properties that will never be used again and transform them for residential living.  Perhaps the Housing Agency is aware of this.  The Empty Homes Agency of the United Kingdom shows examples of empty bank premises which are occupied, and of areas in docklands or areas neglected for many years now in full and dynamic occupation by tenants.  The ground floor can be kept for business but a hugely dynamic interaction can be had to renew and rejuvenate many places in centres of our cities and towns that are neglected.<\/p> <p>  The final point is that one of the things it makes a recommendation on is that planning permission for change of use can be fast-tracked and there is no penalty for change of use from commercial to residential.

We will be appearing before this committee again on 9 March to discuss overall progress.  The Secretary General will be leading a delegation to look at overall progress on many of the issues that we touched on today.  Ultimately, the most effective way to moderate rents and to have a functioning rental market is to increase supply and the entire Rebuilding Ireland programme is dedicated to doing that.

We need to grow the not-for-profit sector and ensure that people on middle incomes can have access to affordable rental accommodation.  <\/p> <p>  The rationale for the rent pressure zones to which we referred earlier is very clear.  They are time-bound, targeted and transparent mechanisms to intervene in the market until the supply comes back on stream.

By way of filling in the committee very briefly, the Employment Bar Association, of which Ms Maguire is the chairperson and I am a former chairperson, is a specialised association of barristers - junior and senior counsel - who act for employers and employees.  It is a significant point to make that we act across the board.  We act for the multinationals, the unions, the big employers and the little employees.  I would go so far as to say this gives us a unique perspective in that we can, I hope, identify the legal issues from both sides of the employment contract - from the employer's point of view and the employee's point of view.<\/p> <p>  In this context, we strongly welcome what the Bill seeks to do and very much endorse and support any attempts to increase protection for vulnerable, atypical employees.  However, we wish to register some fairly serious concerns we have from the legal point of view in respect of how the Bill, as currently drafted, seeks to achieve what I think is its overall aim.  I looked at the sponsoring Deputy's presentation to the committee, and it seemed that what the Bill seeks to do is very positive, that is, to give people the right to the hours they actually work so that their contractual entitlements reflect their reality.  We very much support this.  We question whether it is appropriate to do this by way of further legislation, therefore adding to the complexity of an already complex system, and we certainly question some of the specific parts of the Bill, as currently drafted.  We have set this out in some detail in our submission, but I wish to highlight two points in particular.<\/p> <p>  The first is the essential entitlement the Bill seeks to confer, that is, the right to the increased hours.  This is fine, but the entitlement should reflect the hours actually worked.  This seemed to be the tone of the presentation made by the sponsoring Deputy.  However, section 3, as currently drafted, states that there is an entitlement to hours \"where the band requested exceeds the hours average worked\".  The word \"exceeds\", rather than \"reflects\", is used.  This quite simply gives employees the right to look for hours over and above those they have been working.  It would therefore be useful to consider redrafting this, perhaps using the word \"reflects\", a word that has been used predominantly in previous submissions by the Bill's sponsoring Deputy.<\/p> <p>  The other area we urge the committee to re-examine is the test that has been developed which can allow an employer to refuse a request.  Interestingly, the Long Title of the Bill refers to \"refusal on objectively justified grounds\", which is a great test.  Objective justification was originally developed around equality law and has been used in Irish legislation such as the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act.  It comes with a huge analysis by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the High Court and workplace adjudication officers.  Essentially, it is a fairly simple three-pronged test.<\/p><p>An employer must identify a legitimate aim or real need, after which the employer must show that what it is doing to achieve this aim or need is necessary and appropriate.  The three prongs are, therefore, real need, necessity and appropriateness.  This is a good test which strikes a fair balance between the interests of employers and the rights of employees.  Although it is set out in the Long Title to the Bill, it is not the test that exists in the Bill.  Perhaps this is an oversight.  Instead, the Bill applies a very onerous test whereby employers must show they are in severe financial difficulties.  On any analysis, this is a hard test for an employer to satisfy.<\/p><p> The reason we urge caution does not only relate to the balance perhaps being disproportionately drawn in favour of the employee rather than the employer.  To some extent, this is a policy issue rather than a legal issue.  However, a major legal issue arising is that this is an onerous test which imposes such a disproportionate burden on an employer that there is a real risk that the legislation will be struck down as unconstitutional.  This is not just an idle theoretical possibility.  The Employment Equality Bill 1996 was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional for a similar reason, namely, that it imposed a disproportionate burden on employers in respect of reasonable accommodation in the area of disability discrimination.  That Bill provided that an employer had to provide reasonable accommodation unless it could be shown that it caused the employer undue hardship.  The undue hardship test in the 1996 legislation was similar to the test provided for in the Banded Hours Contract Bill and the test provided for in the former was struck down as unconstitutional.  We urge the committee to reconsider the test formulated in the relevant section and examine again the objective justification test as the latter is, I believe, what the sponsor was trying to achieve in the Long Title.<\/p><p> The final point to which I draw members' attention relates to remedy.  It is a classic legal position that the law can confer all the rights in the world but these rights are only as good as the remedy that comes with them.  For a right to be real and effective, it must have a real and effective remedy.  The only remedy the Bill presents at the moment is that relating to increased hours.  There is nothing about compensation or unfair dismissal.  A stark exclusion is the employee who no longer works for the employer.  While the Bill covers formal employees, it does not afford them a remedy.  It does not afford a remedy to someone who may have been fired for having raised his or her entitlements or may have left a job because increased hours were not provided.  We suggest the committee consider expanding the remedies beyond simply conferring the hours by addressing issues such as compensation and unfair dismissal.<\/p><p> In that context, there is no provision for penalisation, which is a powerful tool in protecting employees' rights.  Penalisation is where an employee has suffered some sort of detriment or has been badly treated because he or she asserted rights.  A classic example, one which is highly contemporary, is whistleblowing.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 does not give employees a right, as such, to be a whistleblower but simply protects the employee who is a whistleblower from penalisation.  If one suffers a detriment as a result of having blown the whistle, this gives rise to a cause of action.  Here, we would suggest members consider introducing penalisation in order that the person who is, in effect, punished for asserting a right to increased hours has a protection and cause of action under the legislation.<\/p><p> We also suggest that introducing new legislation, thereby adding to what is already a very complicated and extensive body of employment legislation, is not necessarily the best and most efficient way of dealing with what the committee is trying to achieve.  We suggest that the committee consider amending existing legislation rather than introducing new legislation.  Ms Maguire will address what it could consider in amending existing legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487674800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee on behalf of the Employment Bar Association, EBA, for inviting us make submissions.  Our submission sets out in detail the points we wish to raise with the committee.  I will address members briefly on whether the joint committee should consider amending existing legislation rather than introducing new legislation.  In the 1970s and early 1980s, which were the early days of employment legislation, we had approximately five key employment Acts.  Since then, the number of Acts has increased to approximately 40.  Rather than add another layer, the committee could consider adapting existing legislation to address the particular problems that have been identified in the Limerick study and at the committee's hearings.  These problems are faced by workers who are not contractually entitled to the hours they work.<\/p> <p>  The advantage of this approach is that employees and employers are already familiar with their rights under the relevant Acts as well as the mechanisms for enforcing them.  Hopefully, if the committee adopts this approach, it will make the new rights more accessible to both sides.  In considering which legislation it may wish to consider, if the committee takes the view that workers whose contracts do not reflect the actual hours worked do not have sufficient notice of their hours from week to week, it could consider amending section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, which already provides certain rights in this regard.  However, the committee may take the view that this needs to be extended.<\/p> <p>  The committee could also consider inserting new provisions in the Act, perhaps along the lines of those contained in the Bill put forward by the sponsor, albeit to reflect the original intention of the sponsor, as we understand it, so as to confer on employees a right to request a statement of their hours over a reference period, defined by the Act, and then a right to acquire a contractual entitlement reflecting the hours they have in fact worked over the reference period.  If that were to be done, it would also be appropriate to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 to include in the contractual terms or terms of employment the right to request the statement of hours over the reference period and that the statement must incorporate the hours to which the employee has been deemed to be entitled under the Organisation of Working Time Act, as amended.  This is the mechanism by which the committee could achieve the end it seeks.<\/p> <p>  If the committee wishes to continue with the Bill, as proposed by the sponsor, it may, as Ms Bolger indicated, need to consider adjusting section 3 to reflect the apparent intention of the sponsor that the hours reflect the hours worked rather than increasing them.  In addition, it should perhaps take account of any unusual circumstance which may have given rise to increased hours over the reference period and incorporate the test on objective justification.  Those are my submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their input, which has been very useful.

I urge the committee to exercise some caution, however, because by excluding, for example, companies with fewer than five employees, the most vulnerable employees could lose out.  While this approach is an option, I suggest it is not a particularly attractive one in terms of trying to maximise the protection available to the most vulnerable employees.<\/p><p>I would point to two things - first, the objective justification and, second, how a formula for working out the six month average hours would be developed.  For example, in some of the submissions that have been made to the committee, reference was made to seasonal work and, perhaps, an uncharacteristic jump in overtime.  They are certainly issues of which the committee should take account.  This should apply only in genuine situations rather than, say, in the case of a person whose hours have increased because of a once-off or seasonal situation.  The six months timeframe as a calculating point is, possibly, not a bad one but the committee could consider increasing it such that the person has to have developed a significant pattern of the increased hours.<\/p><p> Returning to the objective justification, taking the example of the corner shop and a person having a difficulty with working at 8 a.m. when then the legitimate aim of the employer is have the shop open at 8 a.m., the question in this regard would be whether it is necessary for the employee to be there and if it is appropriate to make him or her be there.  It may be that if there are sufficient numbers of people in the shop at that time, it is not necessary for that particular employee to be there, but if there are only a small number of employees there, it may be appropriate.  In a small employer situation the objective justification test could be a lot easier to satisfy because the legitimate aim of the employer is to run the business and that involves the business being open at 8 a.m., 8 p.m. and so on.  The larger employer will be more challenged in proving that there is objective justification for refusing a request.  In terms of the concerns of small business the committee can take the exclusionary approach which is easy in one way but would not satisfactorily deal with protecting employees or it could take the more sophisticated or nuanced approach of the objective justification test which should strike a fair balance between the rights of the employees and the needs of the employers and how those needs are particular, different or, perhaps, more challenging for the smaller employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bolger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#D00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Will Ms Bolger explain how the test referred to in paragraph 38 of her submission would work?

The objective justification test was developed around indirect discrimination and inequality.  The reason we identified the objective justification as it is presented in the aforementioned Act is because the fixed term employee is again an atypical, potentially vulnerable employee.  The test in that regard is where an employee is asserting his or her right to a contract of indefinite duration, effectively to a permanent contract after four years of temporary employment.  This can be resisted by an employer by reference to objective justification.  It is the same test that is applied across the board in all sorts of situations and it requires the employer to identify a real need rather than what he or she desires in terms of business operation.  This need is sometimes referred to as a legitimate aim.<\/p> <p>  The second question that arises is whether what the employer is trying to do in resisting the employee's rights is necessary and appropriate.  This is what the Court of Justice terms a three pronged test: need, necessary and appropriate.  We would suggest that it is a test that strikes the right balance, and even more so from a legal point of view, it is a test that has stood the test of time.  There is plenty of analysis around it and it has borne up well in relation to indirect discrimination and fixed term work situations, both of which would be very active and meaningful entitlements for atypical vulnerable workers.  As a test, it has shown itself capable of striking the right balance between protecting the rights and entitlements of vulnerable employees while at the same time taking account of the needs of employers.  As pointed out by Deputy Niall Collins, the needs of the Coca-Cola type businesses are very different from the needs of the fewer than five employees corner shop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Is the six month timeframe sufficient in terms of identifying real need?

Seasonal work in the hotel industry would typically be work during the summer and perhaps during mid-term breaks and so on when occupancy levels are high.  Six months is a perhaps a little artificial for seasonal employees bearing in mind that they might have had to work during a once-off event in respect of which there was particular demand within a particular season.  Six months may be a little short.  Nine months is a possibility.<\/p> <p>  The committee might bear in mind that 12 months is the period of employment required to be covered under the Unfair Dismissals Act and it, in effect, is almost like a statutory probationary period.  In other words, a person has 12 months as an employee to prove his or her mettle and thereafter acquires a right to his or her job.  A 12 month timeframe may be more of a policy issue rather than one on which we should comment today.  Six months may be a little low but 12 months is the period that has been identified and is generally seen as a successful period in terms of cover under the Unfair Dismissals Act, such that once an employee passes 12 months in an employment, he or she has a right to the job.  The committee could look to the 12 month timeframe in the context of when a person gains entitlement to particular hours.  It may be a little on the high side and as I said that is more of a policy consideration but I would suggest that the six month timeframe has certain vulnerabilities in terms of there being combined seasonal with unexpected increases in hours.  I would not set the timeframe at higher than 12 months, which we would suggest is the absolute limit reflected by the notion of a statutory probationary period under the Unfair Dismissals Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#D00700","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>We have received a huge number of submissions over recent weeks.

According to Ms Bolger, what is currently in place works in practice.  If an employee wants to have a contract which reflects the actual hours he or she is working, for this to be dealt with through the objective justification process, would the matter become one for the Workplace Relations Commission?  My concern in this regard is that in reality the employee would be in a very vulnerable situation having raised an issue with is or her employer.  I was previously a trade union official.  It takes up to three months to get a hearing at the Workplace Relations Commission.

One of the practical effects arises when the person applies for a mortgage.  The problem is not one of being actively abused in the workplace and the Bill has not provided for penalisation.  If the Bill provides for penalisation, a person is at least protected by giving him or her the ability to challenge what is happening but without being penalised in the interim even if it turns out he or she had no right to increased hours.  For example, under equality legislation once a person asserts rights to equality even if it is found the person has not been the victim of discrimination the person is still protected from penalisation.  That is a very real protection for an employee seeking to assert his or her rights.<\/p> <p>  Objective justification in practice works in the same way as seeking a contract for indefinite duration or asserting that something is indirectly discriminatory and the employer pushes back by saying he or she is allowed to do that because it is objectively justifiable.  It is then a matter for the employee to either accept what the employer says or to bring the claim before the workplace adjudication officer.  The person would have to wait three or four months which is a problem of enforcement.  Introducing penalisation is a practical and important protection to say the person cannot be punished for asserting his or her rights whether he or she is correct or not in saying that those rights have not been properly honoured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017022100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1487674800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and I agree with Senator Gavan that this presentation and the documents supplied before this meeting were probably the best we have received.

It is clear the person has to have established a pattern of that work over the period of six months or whatever period it is decided might be appropriate.  This is not a case of, for example, a part-time worker who would like to work full time and asking to work full time.  Incidentally, the worker is entitled to do that under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.  There is nothing to stop a person seeking to move to full-time work and not be penalised as a result but that does not involve an entitlement to be given it.  In this case a person looks for hours to reflect what he or she has worked.  That is why we are so critical of the use of the word \"exceeds\" in section 3 rather than the word \"reflects\".  As the Bill is currently drafted it does entitle someone to apply to get hours and contractual recognition for hours the person is not actually working.  I emphasise \"reflects\" because that word was used repeatedly by Deputy Cullinane in his submissions to the committee and it is a good word.  At the risk of repetition it reflects exactly what the Bill seems to be trying to achieve.<\/p> <p>  The committee might want to work a little harder on the formula for six, nine or 12 months and what sort of proof a person must show of having worked those hours.

The concern that this is something an employer will have to give in excess of what it is already giving perhaps comes from the wording of the section.

The anomaly brought into this Bill by referring to the Industrial Relations Act 1990 is that those employed by or under the State are excluded and teachers are excluded.

N&iacute; fi&uacute; c&oacute;ras a bheith ann muna bhfuil an toil ann &eacute; a chur i bhfeidhm.  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Sa Bhreatain Bheag, sula mb&iacute;onn c&uacute;rsa teanga ar bith ar si&uacute;l, tarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go forleathan go mb&iacute;onn feasacht teanga - language awareness - i gceist sa d&oacute;igh is go dtuigeann daoine an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an teanga agus c&eacute;n f&aacute;th gur cheart an tseirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Rud a tharla dom f&eacute;in uair amh&aacute;in n&aacute; gur d&uacute;radh liom, \"If you say that in English, you might get through\" nuair a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; \"fo-l&iacute;ne 7041\".  T&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; fheasacht teanga d&eacute;anta sa Bhreatain Bheag agus d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; fi&uacute; &eacute; a aistri&uacute; &oacute;n mBreatnais agus &eacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il go forleathan.  N&iacute; ceann-dh&uacute;shl&aacute;n a bheadh ansin.<\/p>  <p>  Is moladh a chuireamar f&eacute;in faoi bhr&aacute;id Roinn na Gaeltachta - gan an teideal ioml&aacute;n a thabhairt air - &eacute; an c&oacute;ras b&oacute;nais.  D&uacute;ramar gur cheart go mbeadh an c&oacute;ras mar a bh&iacute;.  D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; gur &eacute;irigh le duine, fuair s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; 6% sa bhreis.  Mholamar go mbeadh spriocanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la ann agus go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; 2%, 4% agus 6% a bhaint amach ionas go mbeadh an c&oacute;ras ag freastal ar r&eacute;ims&iacute; difri&uacute;la cumais.  Spreagadh breise a bheadh ann do dhaoine le d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar fhoghlaim na Gaeilge.  D&aacute; mbeadh a fhios acu go raibh ard&uacute; c&eacute;ime i gceist, bheadh bunt&aacute;iste ann fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in do dhaoine a bheadh r&eacute;as&uacute;nta lag.  N&iacute; teip a bheadh acu mar a bh&iacute; roimhe seo.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh daoine c&uacute;pla faoin gc&eacute;ad de bh&oacute;nas a fh&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Maidir le coimisi&uacute;n neamhsple&aacute;ch, s&iacute;lim go mbeadh s&eacute; ina chuidi&uacute; an-mh&oacute;r.  Caid&eacute; at&aacute; ag obair sa Bhreatain Bheag?  C&eacute;n c&oacute;ras a oibr&iacute;onn i ndl&iacute;ns&iacute; eile?  Luaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v Ceanada.  T&aacute; dea-eiseaml&aacute;ir in &aacute;iteanna eile.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil drogall ar Ranna Rialtais c&oacute;ras a chur i bhfeidhm maidir le na poist a roghn&uacute; a bheadh an Ghaeilge riachtanach d&oacute;ibh.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh an coimisi&uacute;n seo iad a ainmni&uacute;.  Caithfear cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge a chur mar phreas-oifigigh agus caithfidh Gaeilge a bheith sna rann&oacute;ga &aacute;irithe sin.  S&iacute;lim gur b'fhi&uacute; go m&oacute;r an coimisi&uacute;n sin a chur le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p>  <p>  Maidir le h&aacute;iseanna ar l&iacute;ne, t&aacute; go leor &aacute;iseanna ar l&iacute;ne againn cheana f&eacute;in.  An rud at&aacute; i gceist agam n&aacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; bunaithe ar shonra&iacute; do abairt&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;ideacha agus go mbeadh na c&eacute;adta abairt ann.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh daoine at&aacute; ag obair sna Tithe seo n&oacute; don St&aacute;t i gcoitinne teacht ar abairt ar r&iacute;omhaire agus &eacute;isteach le fuaimni&uacute; na habairte.  N&iacute;l formh&oacute;r na daoine at&aacute; ag obair do Ranna St&aacute;it &aacute;balta ainm a Roinne a r&aacute;.  Rud praitici&uacute;il a bheadh ann ainm gach Roinn a bheith ann, Roinn na Gaeltachta ach go h&aacute;irithe, mar go mb&iacute;onn an-deacracht ag daoine leis an bhfocal \"Oidhreacht\".  \"Idreacht\" a deir beagnach gach duine.  D&aacute; mbeadh bunachar mar sin ar l&iacute;ne agus d&aacute; mbeadh f&aacute;il ar ainmneacha ar eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it, bheadh siad le cloiste&aacute;il agus bheadh abairt&iacute; &uacute;saideacha ann.<\/p>  <p>  An rud deireanach le lua n&aacute; na h&aacute;iseanna dochreidte at&aacute; forbartha anois ag Foras na Gaeilge agus An G&uacute;m agus an seiceala&iacute; litrithe darbh ainm Gaelspell chomh maith.  D&eacute;arfainn nach bhfuil ach c&uacute;pla sc&oacute;r duine a bhfuil seice&aacute;la&iacute; litrithe Gaeilge ar r&iacute;omhair&iacute; acu.  Is rud an-shimpl&iacute; &eacute; an fhadhb sin a leigheas.  N&iacute;l a fhios ag daoine faoi na h&aacute;iseanna at&aacute; ar l&iacute;ne.  &Uacute;s&aacute;ideann dreamanna Google Translate ach n&iacute; thuigeann siad go bhfuil &aacute;iseanna dochreidte forbartha anois ag Foras na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; praitici&uacute;la ann.  T&aacute;imid ag caint ar ruda&iacute; go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh taobh istigh de ch&uacute;pla bliain.  N&iacute; strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge at&aacute; i gceist anseo.  Strait&eacute;is c&uacute;pla bliain at&aacute; ann ar chostas c&uacute;pla milli&uacute;n euro, d&aacute; mbeadh an toil ann.  Gan an toil seo, caint san aer at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute; fi&uacute; an chaint seo a dh&eacute;anamh muna bhfuil an toil pholaiti&uacute;il ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag brath ar na daoine at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair inniu a bhfuil cumhacht agus tionchar acu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2017022100008#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; D&oacute;naill"},{"type":"speech","time":1487699400,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute;.
