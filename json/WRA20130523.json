In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  The European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  The EU procurement directive primarily envisages that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract.  For example, the EU Directive states that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment. <\/p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that proposals for a revised set of EU Directives governing public procurement are being considered at present.  The inclusion of social considerations in public procurement procedures, specifically at the contract award stage, is an issue that is being addressed in the reform of the procurement directives.  In this regard, the revised directive, when implemented, should provide greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria at contract award stage.  Reaching agreement on the public procurement dossiers is a key priority for the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  <\/p><p>  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) has recently approved a pilot initiative to be included in a series of 3 bundles under the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which will require the Contractor to provide for the employment of some members of the workforce employed under a public works contract to be recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed, in addition there is a requirement to provide opportunities for apprentices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA00625"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[24666\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of flood alleviation projects that will be carried out by the Office of Public Works in 2013; the funding to be allocated to these projects; the way this compares to previous years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works addresses flood risk under the following main programmes:<\/p><p>1.

These schemes are exempt from the funding standard provisions of Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990.<\/p><p>  Consolidation of particular public service pension schemes has taken place from time to time in the past, and individual instances of such consolidation may occur in the future.  The consolidation of particular schemes could arise, for example, on foot of the merger or other re-organisation of State Bodies.  It is also a fact that many public service schemes adhere to the standard rules set out in the 'Model' superannuation scheme for non-commercial state bodies.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding consolidation events which may arise in this way, and subject to the very important exception case of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, I have no plans for widespread consolidation of existing public service pension schemes.  For the most part the schemes concerned are localised to particular sectors of the public service, such as the civil service and local government, or to individual bodies, agencies and institutions.  These schemes often originate from legislation specific to the area or body concerned, such as when the foundation Act of a State body makes specific provision for the establishment of a pension scheme for the workforce of that body.  This legislative background, along with differences in rules between schemes, would mean that any attempt at wholesale consolidation would be a difficult, complex and potentially expensive undertaking.<\/p><p>  An effective consolidation of public service pension schemes will in any event be achieved over time by way of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which I launched on 1 January 2013. The Single Scheme applies to all areas of public service employment, and is now the default pension scheme for first-time new-joiner public servants.  In general the only new-joiner public service personnel who can be enrolled in pre-Single Scheme public service schemes are those with a recent work history elsewhere in the public service.  In this sense the multitude of public service schemes to which the Deputy refers can mostly be regarded as semi-closed to new entrants, and will be fully displaced over time by the Single Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Inquiry","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01025"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[24517\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will outline the aim of the proposed bill to allow for a banking enquiry; the resources that will be made available to the committee selected to carry out the proceedings; the timeframe that has been given for the completion of the enquiry; the projected cost of this enquiry to the Exchequer; the way the Oireachtas will be protected from making adverse findings against individuals; if the enquiry will affect in any way, judicial proceedings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, at its meeting on 14th May 2013, approved the publication of the text of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013.  The aim of this Bill is to establish a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework.<\/p><p>  The Bill envisages a central role for the Oireachtas in both initiating and conducting a parliamentary inquiry.  Under the Bill, responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry, the appropriate committee to conduct an inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry. <\/p><p>  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine the resources that will be made available to any committee conducting an inquiry.  The Bill obliges a committee, prior to conducting an inquiry, to prepare a report containing an estimate of the costs and expenses to be incurred in conducting an inquiry to be placed before the House.<\/p><p>  In advance of a decision by the Oireachtas to conduct a banking inquiry and agreement on the type of inquiry and its terms of reference, it is not possible to make any assessment on the cost or duration of a banking inquiry.<\/p><p>  It was firmly established in the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case that Oireachtas Inquiries do not, in general, have the power to make findings of fact adverse to the good name of any person who is not either a Member of the Houses or directly accountable to the Houses by virtue of the terms of their contract or statutory appointment.  Only in such limited cases (or cases of impeachment of officeholders) may the reputations of individuals be put in issue.<\/p><p>  The operation of an inquiry will not impede any judicial proceedings.  Section 12(2) of the Bill provides that, if rules and standing orders so provide, a factor that may be considered by the Houses prior to determining the terms of reference resolution is the likelihood of the inquiry prejudicing any criminal proceedings that are pending or in progress in the State.  Section 26 makes clear that evidence given or sent to a committee for the purposes of an inquiry is not admissible as evidence in any proceedings, including disciplinary proceedings.  Additionally, Section 30 of the Bill permits a committee conducting an inquiry to omit from the final report information that could lead to the identification of a person if, in the committee&rsquo;s opinion, disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice any criminal proceedings that are pending or in progress in the State or any criminal investigation that is currently being conducted in the State or, inter alia, it would not be in the interests of justice to disclose the information.  Section 68 makes clear that a committee may not direct a person to give evidence or a document to it if it could reasonably be expected to prejudice any criminal proceedings that are pending or in progress in the State or any criminal investigation that is currently being conducted in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Licence Sale","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[24650\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300043#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will include in the tender documents for the National Lottery licence a clause that requires the successful bidder to abide by a social responsibility charter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I announced in April 2012 that there will be a competition for the next National Lottery licence.

These national arrangements have benefits that include: <\/p><p> - cash savings; <\/p><p> - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; <\/p><p> - greater purchasing expertise;<\/p><p> - improved consistency; and,<\/p><p> - enhanced service levels. <\/p><p>  Last year my Department issued Circular 06\/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  <\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  <\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example, the indigenous company, which won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. <\/p><p>  In addition, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in September, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. <\/p><p>  In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report of the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:<\/p><p>-   integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;<\/p><p>-   strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p>-   much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;<\/p><p>-   examining the specifications set out for goods and services;<\/p><p>-   evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and<\/p><p>-   strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  Since the appointment of Paul Quinn, CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops \/ meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.<\/p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work. To ensure the reform process take account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office for Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300044#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":36,"content":"<p>Question No. 19 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300044#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[24647\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300044#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to implement a more streamlined process of negotiating pay and conditions for public sector employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>The public service currently employs some 290,000 employees across individual Sectors, Departments and Agencies each with a diversity of terms and conditions of employment, skills, professional backgrounds and expertise.

It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service.  These national arrangements have benefits that include: <\/p><p>- cash savings; <\/p><p>- administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; <\/p><p>- greater purchasing expertise; <\/p><p>- improved consistency; and,<\/p><p>- enhanced service levels. <\/p><p>  Last year my Department issued Circular 06\/12 which makes it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs.  While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm.  The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders.  For example, the indigenous company, which won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers.  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300045#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":78,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 35 and 36 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Croke Park Agreement Issues","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[24521\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the impact of the proposed agreement on Croke Park 2 on medium term expenditure targets on public spending up until Budget 2017.","asker":"1020","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The economic forecasts underpinning Budget 2013 were consistent with the expenditure consolidation set out on Budget day and included provisions for savings through a reduction in the public service pay bill of &euro;300m in 2013 and an overall reduction of &euro;1bn by 2015.

Economic and trading opportunities are a key focus in those relations.  While the research involved in identifying countries which have not received a Ministerial visit since the foundation of the State would be disproportionate in the current context, I can assure the Deputy that Ministerial visits are a central part of the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy which is overseen by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and implemented on the ground abroad in our priority markets by Ambassadorial-led local market teams. <\/p><p>  Ministerial involvement in visits with an economic dimension is varied.  For example, proposals for Ministerial-led trade missions to priority markets involving Enterprise Ireland client companies are submitted each year for consideration simultaneously to both the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself. <\/p><p>  Delivering an intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  The number of Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions conducted with the active support of the Embassy network has more than doubled over the past two years, up from eight in 2011 and 16 in 2012.  In 2013, a record number of Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions are scheduled.   In order to leverage Ireland&rsquo;s role as EU Presidency, trade missions in the first half of 2013 are mainly Europe-focused, with an increased focus on high growth economies in Asia, the Middle East and South America in the second half of the year.  As part of the programme co-ordinated and approved by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself, over 1,000 Enterprise Ireland client companies will take part in 18 Ministerial-led trade missions and 87 international events during the year in major target markets in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.<\/p><p>  I led a trade mission to Turkey last month involving 24 Enterprise Ireland client companies.  Deals secured during the visit are expected to reach well over &euro;30m in value.<\/p><p>  We have also ensured that the programme of Ministerial travel for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day is used to greatest possible effect in terms of economic and trade promotion.  This year it comprised Ministerial visits to 21 countries, including a senior Ministerial visit to the Philippines and Indonesia for the first time, to Saudi Arabia for the first time in over a decade, and to Japan and South Korea for the first time since 2010.<\/p><p>  In addition to these missions, whenever Ministers travel on official business overseas, every effort is made to ensure that appropriate opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to the visit.  <\/p><p>  In April for example, Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello TD, was the first Irish Minister to visit Mongolia, where he attended the summit of the Community of Democracies Ministerial and, while there, had a series of bilateral engagements, including meeting the Foreign Minister of Mongolia, Luvsanvandan Bold, Irish business people resident in Ulaanbaatar, representatives of a number of Mongolian Government Ministries, and a leading mobile internet and telephony company which utilises the services of an Irish technology company.<\/p><p>  I would note also that our Embassy network continues to be strongly focused on supporting opportunities for trade, investment and tourism in all their countries of accreditation, including where they are not resident, assisted in many cases by our Honorary Consuls and local Irish business networks and organisations.  <\/p><p>  Our Ambassador in Hanoi, for example, last week led a delegation of Irish companies to Myanmar\/Burma.  The visit, which was organised in close co-operation with Enterprise Ireland, was the first ever trade trip by a group of Irish companies to Myanmar\/Burma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rates Application","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00825"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[24843\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"following on from the decision to reduce the VAT rate from 13% to 9% and the significance of this reduction to the tourism sector here and the positive implications it has had on the industry in creating and maintaining jobs, giving value for money and so on, if he will keep the VAT rate at 9% to ensure a strong and competitive tourism industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>Any proposals to maintain the 9% rate into 2014 will be considered in the context of Budget 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD01050"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[24926\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300046#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax relief available on pension contributions to a person who has a workplace pension, but who also makes contributions to another pension scheme for which they have no associated income payments.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the question is referring to a situation where an employee is making pension contributions to his or her employer sponsored occupational pension scheme and is also making contributions to a personal pension plan in respect of which the individual does not have a source of relevant earnings against which to claim relief on the contributions.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a possible scenario in which such a situation could arise would be where, in addition to paying contributions to an occupational pension scheme, an individual is also making contributions to a PRSA (other than to an AVC PRSA associated with the occupational pension scheme).  A PRSA can be effected by anyone with or without a source of relevant earnings, which, in the context of PRSAs, in essence means earnings from employment or from a self-employed trade or profession.  However, tax relief on any contributions made is dependent on the existence of an amount of relevant earnings.  Where an individual is already in pensionable employment, his or her employment earnings would not, however, constitute relevant earnings for the purposes of tax relief on contributions to a PRSA.

They allow civil partners to claim the benefits of joint assessment including the tax bands and tax credits that are available to married couples.  The tax legislation also provides for relief for maintenance payments made on the breakdown of a civil partnership the same as is provided for separated or divorced spouses.  There is also capital gains tax relief for property transfers made on foot of such an arrangement.

Prior to transferring to the Department, the Banking Unit had put in place a legal panel of three external law firms using a competitive tendering process. When the functions of the Banking Unit were transferred, the contract for legal services with those external law firms was novated to the Department. It is intended that the Department of Finance will re-tender for a panel of external law firms and it is expected that further savings will be made through this tender process.<\/p><p>Counsels fees in relation to litigation in which the Department of Finance is involved are regularly reviewed by the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitors Office to ensure that costs are minimised and duplication is avoided.<\/p><p>State Agencies under the remit of my Department have provided me with the following information:<\/p><p><bu>Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau<\/bu><\/p><p>The Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau tendered for legal services in 2012. They now have three legal firms working with the Bureau which will lead to better value being achieved going forward.<\/p><p><bu>National Assets Management Agency (NAMA)<\/bu><\/p><p>Since its establishment, NAMA has sought to minimise legal costs to the greatest extent possible. It has established panels of legal firms and runs mini-tenders in order to ensure that pricing for any work assignment is as competitive as possible.  In 2010 and 2011, NAMA incurred legal costs arising from the requirement to carry out legal due diligence on its acquired loans; these costs were part of overall due diligence costs which were largely recovered from the participating institutions.  As regards on-going legal costs incurred by NAMA in the management of its acquired portfolio of loans, these fell from &euro;9.5 million in 2011 to &euro;4.6 million in 2012. The higher level of legal costs in 2011 reflected costs associated with NAMA's establishment.  NAMA legal costs include costs incurred in defending litigation initiated by debtors who NAMA has to defend to protect the taxpayers interest and this element of cost is therefore outside of the Agency&rsquo;s control.  In addition, some of the legal costs incurred by NAMA are recoverable from debtors and, in the case of enforcement, from the proceeds of asset disposals by receivers.<\/p><p><bu>National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA)<\/bu><\/p><p>The NTMA has a range of functions providing asset and liability management services to Government.  These include borrowing for the Exchequer and management of the National Debt, the State Claims Agency (SCA), the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA), the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). The NTMA assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems. NAMA reimburses the NTMA for the cost of these staff and services from its operations. NAMA is responsible for its own legal costs.<\/p><p>The NTMA typically sources legal advice in-house and, apart from exceptional matters such as implementation of the various Government responses to the economic and financial issues facing the State, expenditure on external law firms and barristers by the NTMA has generally been limited. The NTMA recently conducted a competitive tender for the appointment of a panel of external legal advisers in relation to Irish law and it is expected that the panel appointments will take effect in June 2013.  The panel will operate for a period of three years (with an option for the NTMA to extend it for a further 2 year period) and the fees rates will be fixed for the initial three year period. The legal panel will also cover the NPRF and NewERA.<\/p><p>The NDFA incurs external legal fees on behalf of State Authorities principally associated with its mandate for procuring public private partnerships projects. All appointments of external legal advisers in respect of such projects are by competitive tender.<\/p><p>The NDFA is designated as the State Claims Agency when performing the claims management and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.<\/p><p>Following a competitive tender process, legal fees paid to defence solicitors relating to CIS* and ELPLPD** claims were capped at 40% of the plaintiffs&rsquo; professional legal fees down from the previous figure of 50%. Some tenderers accepted fee levels of less than the 40% cap. The combined impact of the tendering process and the 8% government reduction*** has reduced solicitors' legal fees by as much as 20% in some instances.<\/p><p>* Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) relates to the management of all clinical claims taken against health enterprises\/hospitals and clinical, nursing and allied healthcare practitioners covered by the Scheme.<\/p><p>** Employer Liability (EL) means the liability of an employer to its employees for its negligent acts or omissions, and those of its employees. Public Liability (PL) means the liability of an owner\/occupier of premises for its negligent acts or omissions affecting members of the public. Property Damage (PD) Liability means the liability of an owner\/occupier for its negligent acts or omissions leading to damage to a third party&rsquo;s property.<\/p><p>*** All fees for external legal services provided to the SCA are subject to the 8% reduction as implemented by Government Decision S180\/20\/10\/0964C of 3 February, 2009 which came into effect from 1 March 2009 for services rendered after that date.<\/p><p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has also imposed caps on the levels of the fees paid to its panel solicitors in District, Circuit and High Courts and in respect of catastrophic injury.<\/p><p>In August 2012, the SCA announced a new procurement structure requiring barristers to engage in a competitive tendering process under which their fees were capped at up to 25% below prior levels. This was the first time a State agency had procured barristers for personal injury claims in this way.<\/p><p>Under the new procurement arrangements, barristers were required to set out their fees and compete with each other, subject to the respective caps specified by the SCA, for a wide range of legal services in respect of the High Court, District Court and Circuit Court. The Invitation to Tender was posted on the State&rsquo;s public procurement website, <i>www.etenders.gov.ie<\/i> and closed in October 2012. The barrister panels will be announced in June. In total the SCA received approximately 1,000 responses to the invitation to tender.   The new procurement structure also contained a provision that for the first time enabled barristers who have been in practice for less than five years to supply their services to the Agency.   It is expected that this initiative will reduce the overall level of fees paid to barristers by as much as 35%.<\/p><p>The SCA endeavours wherever possible to reduce defence legal costs. Only a proportion of the claims managed result in defence legal costs as a significant volume of these are managed by the SCA's in-house legal team or due to their nature can be managed directly by the SCA's claims management team without resort to legal services thereby limiting the use of external legal services.<\/p><p><bu>Revenue Commissioners<\/bu><\/p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Revenue Solicitor provides legal services for Revenue and in that capacity engages external barristers in circumstances that require specific legal advices and legal opinions in Tax, Customs and general litigation, for advising proofs for Court and Administrative Tribunal cases and for providing full advocacy services in the conduct on Tax, Customs and general litigation (both civil and criminal) before the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Courts, Appeal Commissioners and other administrative tribunals. External solicitors are engaged for debt collection and recovery. These are key components of Revenue's care and management of tax and duties.<\/p><p>Enhanced procedures governing the payment of professional fees to the panel of Counsel instructed by the Revenue Solicitor's Division were introduced in 2011 and further augmented and strengthened in 2012. The Revenue Solicitor and Deputy Revenue Solicitor manage the approval, selection and payment of Counsel. The procedures are designed to achieve the objectives of transparency, good governance and value for money<\/p><p>Indicative capped fees have been fixed for Counsel briefs and other items relating to Revenue litigation. Advisory work provided by Counsel will be paid on the basis of hours worked by Counsel subject to capped fees. The panel has also been expanded to ensure the utilisation of the appropriate level of counsel and to ensure value for money.<\/p><p>In addition to internal procedures to ensure value for money, all brief fees paid to counsel in excess of &euro;10,000 exclusive of VAT, are considered and advised on by the Office of the Attorney General and then considered and sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Revenue also consults with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Attorney General's Office on fees paid to counsel to ensure consistency across State agencies.<\/p><p>The total fees paid in the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 are shown in Table 1.<\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b><\/p><p><b>Total fees paid to Counsel in respect of services provided to Revenue Commissioners, including VAT.<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>2008<\/b><\/th><th><b>2009<\/b><\/th><th><b>2010<\/b><\/th><th><b>2011<\/b><\/th><th><b>2012<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,949,170<\/td><td>&euro;1,660,464<\/td><td>&euro;1,489,762<\/td><td>&euro;1,720,556<\/td><td>&euro; 2,168,905<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Revenue has contracts with six firms of solicitor to provide legal services associated with debt collection and recovery.

Details of the courses selected for funding by the independent panel will be available in the coming weeks.  More information on Springboard is available at www.Springboardcourses.ie.<\/p><p>  Both public and private providers were also eligible to apply for funding from the Momentum fund, subject to a tender process.  There were two stages in this process: (i) pre-qualification and (ii) project proposals assessment. Notification of the pre-qualification for the current round of funds was published on the e-tenders website last summer.  Pre-qualified providers had the opportunity to submit proposals which were considered in line with the tender specification.  No subsequent notification has been published.

To this end, we agreed on 2 October 2012 to accelerate the reduction in Public Service numbers in order to achieve the previous end 2015 target of 282,500 by end 2014 instead.<\/p><p>  Greater efficiencies in the way the Public Service is going about its business means that some posts have been identified by Departments as surplus.  Where surplus staff cannot be redeployed, Voluntary Redundancy can now be used.  Initially Voluntary Redundancy is being rolled out in three areas &ndash; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and specific parts of the Health and Education Sectors.  These Departments have estimated that there will be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from these areas over time, mainly from back office and support areas and management and administrative grades.  How this estimated number of exits translates into actual savings over the next few years will be determined by a number of variables including the take-up rate among staff in the targeted areas, their number and grade mix, timing of departure, etc., information on which will not become apparent until the scheme is offered to the effected staff.<\/p><p>  Analysis by my Department estimates that for every 1,000 employees who opt to participate in a voluntary redundancy programme there will be a gross cost of approximately &euro;109 million.  The gross payroll savings for 1,000 employees will amount to &euro;57 million every year.  Therefore the initial cost of 1,000 employees leaving would be recouped in two years.  Further savings will be realised in the future when these employees reach retirement age, because of their reduced pension entitlements.  A more definitive estimate of the cost of the scheme will emerge as the relevant Departments determine the precise areas and numbers to be targeted for VR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[24912\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works proposes to carry out works on the Bulkawn River, Ballinrobe, County Mayo, due to the amount of land in this area that is flooding on a regular basis and causing great inconvenience to persons in the area; if remedial works will be carried out at two pinch points on the river namely at the Sportlann in Ballinrobe and at the concrete dam west of the Neale road bridge, which needs to be lowered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>The area in question is a limestone area with a high water table and therefore wet land is characteristic of the area.

The essential elements and protections of the existing Public Service Agreement will also remain in place and industrial peace in the public service can be secured at a critical time in our path to economic recovery.<\/p><p><br \/>  Also today I have published legislation to give effect to the pay reduction for those earning over &euro;65,000, the parallel reduction in public service pensions and other contingent measures to enable the Government achieve its savings requirements in the event of non-ratification of collective agreements.  Ireland has successfully concluded the tenth review mission of our EU-IMF Programme which was completed on 2nd May 2013.  In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met its commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognized by the Troika.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the existing Public Service Agreement, the Implementation Body, which is charged with driving the implementation of the Agreement has carried out two annual reviews of the Agreement to date.  These reviews have found that approximately &euro;1.5bn in savings has been facilitated by the Agreement during its first two years, comprising of &euro;810m and &euro;678m in sustainable pay bill and non-pay (efficiency) savings respectively.<\/p><p><br \/>  The reports of the Body also show that significant reforms have been delivered across the sectors of the public service, including for example: 1. Extensive redeployment and reassignment of staff, for example in the health and education sectors. 2. Progress on rationalising structures and office requirements, for example Department of Agriculture and Revenue local offices, court venues and Teagasc offices. 3. Introduction of revised rosters, for example in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and health service locations to better match resources with demands. 4. Local authorities have changed structures, the way in which services are delivered and the way staff are organized and deployed in order to manage the significant reduction in staff in the sector, as approximately 8,500 have left the sector since 2008.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Body is currently completing the third annual review of the Agreement which will assess the level of savings achieved and progress on implementing the reform commitments under the framework of that Agreement during the relevant period. I expect to receive the Body's Report shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Inquiry","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[24968\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300049#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if any decision has been taken on the holding of a banking inquiry; his views on this matter; when a decision is expected to be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, at its meeting on 14th May 2013, approved the publication of the text of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013.

They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In the case of Invalidity Pension appeals, the numbers of appeals received has increased from 642 in 2009 to 4,765 in 2012. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, reviewing and  improving business processes and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.

The proposed continuation of turf-cutting on many of the SACs for several years while a national plan is put in place is clearly at variance with EU law, and in particular Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. The European Commission and the Government have concluded that we simply do not have the legal discretion to follow that path. In face of our current infringement proceedings, to do so would be to invite certain litigation against the State, including potential injunctive action and substantial fines.<\/p><p><br \/>  At no point did my officials or officials of the European Commission give the TCCA any reason to believe that a &#8220;phased transition plan&#8221; could be acceptable.  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog SACs are now engaging with my Department in findings acceptable solutions within the law.

The lack of such facilities in some rural communities is a significant impediment to their further development, and it is in this context that significant financial resources have been made available to rural communities all over Ireland under the basic services measure of the RDP since it commenced in 2009.<\/p><p>  From an overall original programme allocation of &euro;427 million, &euro;49.61million was allocated to the basic services measure at the start of the programme. The RDP was amended in 2012 to take account of the increased EU co-funding rate of 85% which resulted in an overall decrease in the Axis 3&amp;amp;4 allocation. These changes also facilitated a more centralised approach to the allocation of funding with the removal of individual measure allocations. At that point the Basic Services measure had a very high level of both spend and commitment and I facilitated an extra &euro;19.3m million to measure.<\/p><p>  To date expenditure under the basic services measure has reached &euro;32.5 million with a further &euro;18.6m million in contractual commitments to be paid before the end of the Programme. This represents a significant proportion of both the original and revised programme allocation, and, in this context, the measure has now reached its full allocation. My Department is working with the Local Development Companies contracted to deliver LEADER elements of the programme to support in particular the provision of both direct and indirect support to entrepreneurial activity in rural areas for the remainder of this programming period including support for agricultural diversification, new business creation and rural tourism. However, there is still funding available for innovative solutions for the renewal and development of small towns and villages as well as the conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage.<\/p><p>  The &euro;32.5 million already spent under the basic services measure has provided support for a very diverse range of projects all over Ireland. In particular the measure has supported the development of a number of community centres that facilitate social and leisure activities, often in remote rural areas. The measure has also supported the provision of certain arts and cultural facilities, along with small scale leisure infrastructure such as playgrounds and sporting facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300057#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Pollution","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300057#WRP01550"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[24924\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300057#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will approve proposals presented to his Department by Roscommon County Council to address the cryptosporidium problem on the Roscommon central regional water supply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>A proposal to address the cryptosporidium problem on the Roscommon Central Regional Water Supply was received from Roscommon County Council in my Department on Friday evening, 17 May.

The project is at implementation stage in two pilot sites, Wheatfield Prison and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  The IPS has identified a number of areas where restorative practices can be introduced within both sites.  Intensive training on both pilot sites in conjunction with an accredited training provider, The International Institute of Restorative Practices, has been provided.  To date, five \"introduction to restorative practices in a secure setting\" courses, and three \"facilitator skills\" training courses have been hosted in Wheatfield and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  In addition, conducting \"restorative adjudications\" training was provided for all senior managers involved in conducting disciplinary hearings and key staff have attended conferences, courses and seminars to further their knowledge.

This intensive training programme, provided for key personnel including heads of function, senior managers, supervisors and class officers, will ensure all staff involved are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to implement restorative practices in their area of responsibility.  A series of restorative practices initiatives is being advanced in both sites which include, inter alia, information campaigns, conflict resolution and embedding restorative justice approaches to certain disciplinary adjudications.

As part of its 2012-14 strategic plan, in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service undertook to examine the feasibility of a Social Impact Investment Project.  The objective of the project is to provide a programme of support to targeted short sentence prisoners, commencing in prison but particularly on their release, to reduce re-offending and enable reintegration in their communities.

It is envisaged that, through redeployment and a forthcoming internal competition, full time ISM Co-ordinators will be assigned to all prisons in the coming months. Having a dedicated team of ISM Co-ordinators in all prisons will enhance the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitate the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process. A complement of over twenty ISM Co-ordinator posts have been identified to date, through the Transformation process, to provide vital coordination and support for the initiative at prison level.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Institution<\/th><th>No.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlerea<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cloverhill<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dochas<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughan House<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training Unit<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheatfield<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300061#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Medical Service","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300061#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[24902\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300061#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current status of the Irish Prison Service's Joint Task Review of Healtcare; the anticipated date of completion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that the Joint Task Review of Healthcare in the Prison Service is an essential component of the overall programme of review and reform being undertaken in accordance with the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014.

Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country will be covered up to next Friday 24 May. I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  By the end of the week some 2,000 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 30,000 tonnes, will have benefitted from my Department's contribution to these transport costs.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Animal Welfare Hotline which I established remains open for those with emergency situations or who need information about where to source fodder:<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).  The majority of calls received are enquiring about fodder availability and these callers are being referred to Co-ops in their respective areas.  Those farmers with animal welfare issues are being referred to the DVOs where there are systems in place to deal with them on a case by case basis. <\/p><p><br \/>  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We need to maximise production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this aspect in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  Looking forward, it is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard I and my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., have announced a temporary and targeted adjustment of two provisions of the Nitrates Regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms in the coming months. <\/p><p><br \/>  The adjustments involve: <\/p><p>- A discounting of some concentrate feeding when calculating the overall level of phosphorus allowed on grassland farms in 2013 and 2014; and <\/p><p>- an extension of two weeks to the period during with chemical fertiliser can be applied to grassland.<\/p><p><br \/>  In order to ensure sufficient allowance of phosphorus for grassland application this year and 2014, some meal feeding in 2012 and 2013 will be discounted. The period during which chemical fertiliser can be applied to land this year has been extended by two weeks up to and including 30 September 2013.  These measures will provide every opportunity to farmers to maximise grass growth and conservation into next Autumn.  I believe that these pro-active measures will assist considerably in assisting farmers in avoiding difficulties next winter and thereafter. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of the direct support schemes, mindful of ongoing difficulties, I decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department will also make every effort to ensure that payments under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commence as early as possible in September, while taking into account of the need to adhere to the requirement in the governing EU Regulation, which provides that all eligibility checks must be finalised before full payments can commence  .<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of other supports, to date, over 29,300 of the remaining 30,200 REPS 4 participants have been paid a total of nearly &euro;170m in respect of the 2012 application period, with almost &euro;35m of this issuing in 2013. A further &euro;1m issued in the past week to REPS 4 farmers. Payments to the final 900 query cases are ongoing and are expected to be finalised shortly.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following the issue of over 2,000 AEOS payments valued at approximately &euro;3m over the last two weeks, a further &euro;700,000 will issue to nearly 300 more farmers in the next week. This will bring the total paid under AEOS 1 and 2 applicants to over &euro;40m in respect of the 2012 application period, &euro;15m of which issued in 2013 alone.<\/p><p><br \/>  It will be clear, therefore that my Department has been playing its full part in assisting in the current difficult situation and in taking steps to enable farmers to avoid problems into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300065#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300065#WRX00925"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[25161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052300065#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on whether sufficient progress is being made in reducing the State's legal bill in his Department and any State agencies under his aegis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>My Department actively manages its legal affairs and constantly seeks to minimise legal costs.

Section 11 of the current contract states as follows:<blockquote> The medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the relevant Health Board, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This will include such preventive and developmental services as are currently provided or may be developed in the new style of practice which this agreement facilitates, some of which services may be included on the list of special items of service for which specific payments shall be made.<\/blockquote>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is also available free of charge in hospitals.  Warfarin testing is carried out by some general practitioners as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.

Expenditure on office furniture has also been significantly reduced.  It is the policy of the Department of Transport to operate within budget and achieve savings wherever possible.
