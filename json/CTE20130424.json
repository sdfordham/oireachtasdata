I am proposing this amendment to deal with the potential misselling of payment protection insurance policies, problems that arise some years later about endowment mortgages, risky borrow-to-invest schemes and so forth.  Very often people only find out well after the six-year period has expired that there is a problem with the product they bought.  The most high profile example involves the misselling of payment protection insurance policies, a matter which is being investigated by the Central Bank.  <\/p><p>  I understand that in other jurisdictions the time limit applies after a person becomes aware that the product he or she bought was in some way defective or potentially missold.  That is the essence of what I am proposing.  The Minister should consider moving from the situation where the existing time limit is strictly six years from the date a product is sold to one where people would have a period of time from when they become aware of an issue with the product in which to make a complaint about the product bought.  Very often, under existing legislation, people find out too late that they were sold a pig in a poke and have no recourse through the ombudsman.  Therefore, this is a sensible proposal.  If the Minister cannot accept it under this Bill, I hope he will consider legislating for it in another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400002#A03000","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1366826400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Section 3 of the Statute of Limitations Act 1991 introduced an element of discoverability to the limitation period applicable in respect of claims for personal injuries.

I take the example of a self-employed person who purchased a payment protection insurance policy.

I raised the issue addressed by amendments Nos. 8 to 15, inclusive, at that point.  Where a company is investigated by the Central Bank, it will nominate a firm or an individual to prepare a report to be approved by the Central Bank.  Where it fails to nominate a firm or an individual or confirmation of the proposed firm or individual is denied by the Central Bank, the bank will appoint a firm to conduct a review.  I propose through the amendments the introduction of a better system whereby the Central Bank would appoint the firm to carry out the investigation or review.  The onus would not, therefore, be placed on the company subject to the review to identify an appropriate reviewer.  It would be a more meaningful review if it were conducted by an independent firm selected by the Central Bank from a panel of qualified firms and enhance the integrity of the resulting report.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but that is my interpretation having read through the Bill initially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400003#B01100","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1366826400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I have a lengthy speaking note which I will deliver for the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Bill provides a new power for the Central Bank to require financial service providers to commission and submit to it an independent and objective report.  The Central Bank has significant information gathering powers which are being further enhanced under the Bill, given the central importance of information to the business of regulation.  Part 2 creates a new way to collect information and insights on financial service providers.  The new power is an additional tool for the Central Bank to supervise entities and not something which is intended or has the capacity to take the place of direct regulatory oversight such as authorised officer powers.  The provision is modelled on the regime that has operated in the UK financial system in the past decade, with some modifications to ensure it is used in a balanced and proportionate way.<\/p><p>  The proposed reports are not a substitute for direct supervision by the Central Bank and it is not intended that they would be used without regard to their necessity and the associated cost burden on firms.  The reports may be used for a variety of purposes, including a review of controls over data security; controls to prevent money laundering; the adequacy of systems and controls, corporate governance, senior management, compliance and risk management arrangements; fair customer treatment; market abuse and capital adequacy.  A key aspect of the provision is to ensure there is confidence in the analysis and its objectivity, which includes avoiding client bias.  In examining the most suitable approach a number of models were considered, including having the Central Bank undertake its own analysis, getting the financial service provider to work with a reviewer of the Central Bank's choosing or providing for the financial service provider to nominate a reviewer, subject to Central Bank approval.  The third approach was chosen and is reflected in the Bill for the reasons I will set out.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank already has extensive powers to gather information, prepare analysis and produce its own reports directly.

When the Central Bank is of the view that a firm needs to be investigated or have a report prepared on an issue, why is it preferable for the firm to appoint another to compile the report, as opposed to the Central Bank, as the independent watchdog and regulator, appointing a firm to do the work?  There was a considerable amount of material in the Minister's response and he outlined the safeguards.  However, I do not get the principle involved.  Why is it preferable for the firm to appoint another?  Why not remove any doubt about the independence, objectivity and integrity of the report by having the Central Bank put together a panel of appropriate firms every year under the procurement process and dip into it to appoint one of them to produce a report on a particular issue about a licensed entity?

I will give the Deputy a short summary to give him an insight into the thinking behind the measure.  What emerged from the process were concerns that the Central Bank might take action on the basis of interim or incomplete reports, to which it can have access under section 12.  There was also the need for prior consultation with a regulated financial services provider to confirm the factual accuracy of any information contained in a report before the Central Bank would take any action arising from a report and the need for clarity around how and when the power to require a report would be used by the bank.<\/p><p>  In response to the consultation process a number of amendments are being proposed to the Bill which enhance the focus and balance of the provision without compromising its effectiveness.  These include an amendment to section 15 which will enable the Central Bank to sit down with the reviewer to discuss the findings of the report and any other issue that might be relevant and a further amendment to provide that the bank may issue guidelines setting out clearly how and under what circumstances it would make use of these powers.  I am open to suggestions as to how the provision might be improved to ensure adequate detachment and objectivity.  However, I would like to preserve the core design of this part where it is the responsibility of the financial service provider to nominate the reviewer for Central Bank approval and the contractual relationship remains between the reviewer and the reviewee, albeit subject to Central Bank oversight.

However, instead of the bank choosing whoever it deemed necessary, with it being forced to refuse someone which is an issue because the bank must find reasons to refuse him or her, would it not be more appropriate for a suitable panel to be identified by the bank?

It is important that where key information comes to the attention of the Central Bank it is taken seriously and acted upon.  There are examples in the past where whistleblowers have made reports to the Central Bank in good faith and in the public interest without any further action from the Central Bank or protection for the person concerned.  In the case of Mr. Eugene McErlean, the deputy governor, Mr. Matthew Elderfield has already issued a public apology on behalf of the Central Bank.<\/p><p>  There is a balance to be struck here.  On the one hand we would all expect the Central Bank to take action, where warranted, however other disclosures could be routine or minor, not to mention the possibility of frivolous or vexatious claims.  The Central Bank will receive information from many sources - authorised officers, firms, auditors, skilled person reports, information requests, inspections, etc.  It is important that action is taken based on the seriousness of the issue and an assessment of the risks involved.  A blanket requirement to act on all whistleblower disclosures which would not apply to information received through other channels may be a little black and white to work effectively.<\/p><p>  I have, however, some sympathy for the point raised by the Deputy and will ask my Department to consult with the Attorney General's office on the scope for an appropriate Report Stage amendment here.  Perhaps we could include a requirement for Central Bank officials to report to the Central Bank Commission on the action taken on foot of disclosures and to explain cases where no further action was taken.  This would allow for oversight of Central Bank officials by the Central Bank Commission, which is its function, but would also allow reasonable scope for information to be reviewed and assessed before deciding if further action is required.  I will put that to the Attorney General and see if we can frame an appropriate amendment to meet the well-made point of Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400006#E04500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1366828800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

advice.  I am delighted this issue is finally about to be tackled.  I would have liked to have seen it done some time ago.  We published a Bill in 2011 addressing the regulation of this sector.  It passed Second Stage, but did not progress further.  I am glad it is now being done.  I will keep my comments brief at this stage.<\/p><p>  While the Central Bank does not have a full set of tools available to it at this point, it has nonetheless been very active in the area.  I understand the number of firms offering such services has reduced quite significantly, not least because of the enforcement activity the Central Bank has undertaken.  The sector has been squeezed.  We all know of the cases that went so badly wrong with people unfortunately losing a lot of money including Home Payments Limited and a number of others.  Many people relying on the services of such firms are quite vulnerable.<\/p><p>  For a number of years we have needed this area to be regulated and monitored, especially where firms are handling people's money.  Where people put their trust in firms to negotiate with their creditors and to handle their money there is a very strong onus on the Government to ensure that area is regulated and to introduce some transparency on fees.  Through the years these companies often made great promises about what they could negotiate with their creditors to have debt reduced.  People were paying into these firms and finding out subsequently that a good proportion of the money that went in went to the fees of the firms.  I look forward to the debate.  I am glad that this area will finally be regulated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400008#G00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1366829400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I know that this is an area in which the Deputy is particularly interested and it was the subject of a Private Members' Bill he introduced.  We had a number of debates about this previously and I am pleased that the commitments I gave on that occasion are being fulfilled now.  The Deputy's amendment relates to debt-management companies and I have also tabled a series of amendments.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill I mentioned that was discussed in the House last year.  The Government promised that legislation would be brought forward to provide for the regulation of debt management and debt advice companies.  This is now being done.<\/p><p>  Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 will be amended to provide for a regulatory regime for the services of debt advice and debt management firms that currently fall outside existing regulatory regimes.  This will be achieved by incorporating a new category of regulated business into the existing regulatory framework in Part V of the Act, thereby extending the application of the provisions of financial services law that currently apply to regulated financial service providers to debt management and debt advisory firms.  A debt management firm is defined in the amendment as a person who, for remuneration, provides debt management services to one or more consumers other than an excepted person.  A consumer means an individual acting otherwise than in the course of business or a micro enterprise within the meaning given by Commission Recommendation 2003\/361\/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.  Debt management services and excepted persons are also defined in the amendment. <\/p><p>  It is also proposed to amend the existing definition of &quot;money transmission services&quot; in Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 in order to clarify and make it clear that money transmission services provided by such debt management firms fall to be regulated.<\/p><p>  The Bill also provides for transitional arrangements to apply to existing debt management firms.  Such firms will be required to apply to the Central Bank no later than three months after the commencement of the Act for the appropriate authorisation.<\/p><p>  The legislation reflects most of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members' Bill.  The structure may differ in that it has been incorporated into Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.  The benefits of this structure is that existing provisions in Part V on the imposition of conditions, revocation of authorisations etc. will apply to the firms that will be covered by the new regime.  The introduction of this new category of regulated business will subject such firms to the powers and provisions contained in other legislation relating to regulated financial service providers, such as fitness and probity powers in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, administrative sanction powers under the Central Bank Act 1942 and the supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 when enacted.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath has proposed to insert a new section 36B making it an offence for a person to hold themselves out, or claim to be, a debt management provider without authorisation.  The legislative proposal, if adopted, will provide that the provision of debt management services without an authorisation will be prohibited by virtue of section 29(1) of the 1997 Act.  While that is the case, the activity of holding oneself out or claiming to be performing an activity is not the same as performing that activity, and holding oneself out, or claiming to be the holder of an authorisation is not the same as performing the activity.  Thus the prohibition contained in section 29 would not prohibit these related types of related conduct.  My officials will examine this and discuss the matter with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>  The proposed section 36C(8) would make it an offence to provide false or misleading information with respect to an authorisation.  This proposed prohibition does not appear to be contained within either the legislative proposal, or within the existing authorisation regime provided for in Part V.  The 1997 Act appears to penalise this conduct through provisions such as section 31(2)(<i>c<\/i>), which would allow an authorisation to be refused where such information is provided; or section 36A (1)(<i>c<\/i>), which would allow an authorisation to be removed in such circumstances.  My officials will examine this and discuss the matter with the Office of the Attorney General.<br \/> The proposed section 36G 3(<i>a<\/i>) requires an authorised debt management adviser to advise the consumer in writing of the existence, role and function of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This not the appropriate place for this provision.  These are private companies and it would be disproportionate to place this requirement on them.  There are also public bodies to advise consumers with regard to MABS and its role.<\/p><p>  That covers most of the points.  As I have said, we will have some discussions with the Office of the Attorney General between now and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400008#G00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1366829400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and for going through the elements of the Private Members' Bill that have and have not been incorporated here.

The bank already has powers under the EC (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 and the Investor Intermediaries Act 1995 to publish warning notices alerting the public to investment firms operating without the appropriate authorisation.<\/p><p>  One of the principal functions of the Central Bank is to protect the public interest, in particular, the interests of consumers of financial services, by monitoring and regulating the provision of those services within its jurisdiction.  The regulatory regime established by law to enable the bank to carry out this important function requires that all persons or entities wishing to provide financial services must first become regulated financial service providers by applying to the bank for authorisation.  The bank is then equipped with an array of investigative regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure these regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.  However, sometimes a person outside the regulatory remit of the Central Bank will engage in conduct that constitutes a contravention of financial services legislation and jeopardises the interests of consumers of financial services.  One example would be a moneylender acting without the requisite authorisation.  To properly carry out its functions, the Central Bank needs power to restrain such conduct by unregulated entities.  The bank has already been given power to restrain breaches of the law by unregulated entities in a limited number of areas.  For example, section 36(<i>j<\/i>) of the Central Bank Act 1997, on which this section is based, allows the bank to apply to court for an order restraining any person from breaching the law relating to <i>bureaux de change<\/i> and money transmissions businesses. The purpose of this section is to give the bank a general power to apply to court for an injunction to restrain a contravention of financial services legislation, regardless of who is the perpetrator of that contravention.<\/p><p>  The United Kingdom has a similar provision in section 380 of its Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which enables the financial services authority to apply to court for an injunction to restrain any person from contravening a provision of its financial services legislation.  Subsection (1) of this section provides that the Central Bank may apply to court for an order restraining conduct that constitutes a contravention of financial services legislation, regardless of whether the person engaging in that conduct is a regulated financial services provider.  Subsection (2) provides that the court may make an order compelling a person to do an act that he is she is required to do by or under a provision of financial services legislation.  Subsection (3) provides that the bank may apply <i>ex parte<\/i> for an order under this section and that the court may grant the order if it considers it necessary to do so.  Subsection (4) provides that the court may grant an order under this section, subject to such terms as it thinks fit.  Subsection (5) provides that the court may grant an interim order pending the final determination of an application under this section.  For example, the bank may apply <i>ex parte<\/i> for an order under this section.  The court might be unwilling to give a final order without first giving the person affected an opportunity to state his or her case.  This subsection is designed to allow the court to grant an interim order pending the final determination of the matter on notice to the person affected.  Subsection (6) provides that the court may discharge or vary an order made under this section.<\/p><p>  I think that covers the point raised by the Deputy.  The matter is within the hands of the court which can grant interim or absolute orders, either of which it may discharge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400010#J01000","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1366830600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 76 to 84, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400010#J01300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1366830600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 76:<blockquote><br \/>In page 33, lines 21 to 33, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:&ldquo;(1) This section applies to a person&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) on whom any sanction has been imposed under section 33AQ, 33AR or 33AV of the Act of 1942, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) who has been convicted of an offence under financial services legislation.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote><\/blockquote>These amendments extend the scope of the restitution order to include restitution against individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400010#J01400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1366830600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 77:<blockquote><br \/>In page 33, subsection (2), lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;a regulated financial service provider&rdquo;

Successive ombudsmen have called for this power and I welcome the fact that the Minister is making a move in that direction.  We had a Private Members' Bill dealing with the issue some time ago, which forms the basis of our amendment.  It is very important that these changes are made and it will certainly help to hold repeat offenders to account in the financial services area and weed out the remaining bad practices that remain.  It will be an important consumer protection tool if it is properly implemented.<\/p><p>  Having welcomed the fact that the Minister is making some moves, I want to make some comments on amendment No. 97.  The Minister is proposing to give the ombudsman the power to issue a report if he or she believes it in the public interest to do so in circumstances in which a financial service provider has in the previous year had at least three complaints relating to it upheld by the ombudsman.  The Minister is setting the bar quite high, particularly for large financial services providers, as having three complaints upheld would be par for the course and no big deal.  Other providers may not complete many transactions in the year and if they had two complaints upheld every year, it would be in the public interest for them to be reported.  The bar has been set too high and it should be possible to publish this information in an aggregate form, as consumers have the right to know if complaints against financial services firms have been upheld.<\/p><p>  I also question the information that the ombudsman is allowed to publish, which equates to the name of the provider against whom three complaints have been upheld, the identity of any group that the provider may be a member of and the number of complaints found to be substantiated or partly substantiated against that provider.  There does not appear to be any provision whereby the ombudsman can provide descriptions of the types of complaint that have been upheld against a provider, which is crucial information, so I hope the Minister will address the issue.  For example, if it is reported that four complaints have been upheld against AIB and Bank of Ireland, the information is meaningless, as they could relate to interest rates, fees, charges or the mis-selling of payment protection or investment products.  The ombudsman should be given the power to describe the subject area of the upheld complaint.<\/p><p>  I note that the Minister is proposing that if a financial services firm appeals a decision of the ombudsman, the ombudsman is not allowed to report the fact that there was a finding against a provider when it is subject to appeal.  That is unnecessary; there could be a footnote to the effect that a firm has had five complaints upheld with three under appeal, for example.  Otherwise, I am concerned that appealing may become a delaying tactic to prevent information from being published and put into the public domain.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister is making some moves, but his proposals are overly restrictive.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond to my points and be open to improving the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400011#K00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1366831200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The issue of granting the ombudsman permission to publish the names of financial service providers against which complaints have been upheld has been debated for some time.  A Private Members' Bill on the issue, sponsored by the Deputy and his party, was debated last year in the D&aacute;il.  At that stage I indicated that legislation in this area was necessary to allow the ombudsman to name regulated financial institutions about which he upheld or substantially upheld claims.  The ombudsman initiated a consultation process on the issue of publishing the complaints records of individual financial service providers, and in the submissions received, financial service providers raised the issue of how the information on the complaints could be presented.  The ombudsman has long held the view that the public interest is better served by his having the ability to publish information on the complaints record of firms about which such complaints are upheld.  The review of international best practice has confirmed this.<\/p><p>  Dissemination of such information in a responsible fashion allows consumers to analyse the performance of all financial service providers and helps them make an informed choice while choosing a provider or product.  The naming of financial service providers in certain circumstances will support the work of the ombudsman in carrying out his duties in an effective manner.  Much work went into developing the proposal set out in the Bill and the ombudsman was consulted during the preparation of the legislation and is aware of its provisions.<\/p><p>  The ombudsman suggested certain safeguards that should be included in any legislation to give the office power.  The first is that there should be discretion as to whether an institution should be named and the second is that a complainant should not be named.  The third is that there should be statutory privilege covering the naming of institutions.  These safeguards have been provided in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath has examined the possibility of extending this further so that publication would occur after two complaints rather than three, with the nature of the complaints published by way of additional information.  He is also asking that we examine the possibility that the appeals mechanism, particularly the provision for non-publication until resolution of the appeal, could be used as a device to delay publication.  These are legitimate points and I will examine them between now and Report Stage.  As this Bill was constructed after consultation with the Financial Services Ombudsman, I will need to consult with the office again before making any further change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013042400011#K00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1366831200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

There should not be any specification of the number of complaints that must be upheld against a firm before the matter is published, and there should be a provision for the information to be published in aggregated form.  It is essential that the nature of the complaint that has been upheld be described or categorised; as has been mentioned, if there are four or five complaints against one of the big banks, the information given is utterly meaningless.

We could literally put somebody out of business if information was published on the back of one complaint.  The financial ombudsman will have to make a judgment that what he or she is doing is in the public interest within the town.  In small towns and communities, rumours alone can put people out of business.  Three complaints seems reasonable but we will examine the issue again and discuss it further.

The council views interactions with this committee as integral to our work.  In addition, this is our first appearance as a statutory body before the committee, following the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  Other members in attendance today are Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Dr. Alan Barrett and Dr. Donal Donovan.  Unfortunately, Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is based in the United States, cannot attend today.  Mr. Diarmaid Smyth from the council secretariat is also present.<\/p><p>  Today I will cover our fourth assessment report which was published on 10 April.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council.  Its main purpose is to assess the macroeconomic and budgetary projections set out by the Government in budget 2013, including the appropriateness of the overall fiscal stance in advance of the stability programme update.  The report also considers compliance with the budgetary rule set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.<\/p><p>  There were a number of developments post budget 2013 that had a bearing on the conclusions reached in the report.  First, the fiscal outturn in 2012 was significantly better than had been estimated in budget 2013.  The Department of Finance had estimated a general Government deficit of 8.2% of GDP in 2012.  Based on end of year Exchequer returns and higher than expected nominal GDP, a deficit of 7.7% of GDP was assumed in the fiscal assessment report.  On Monday, the CSO reported that the 2012 general Government deficit was 7.6% of GDP which was also well below the programme target of 8.6%.  Second, the promissory note transaction, while having a limited effect on the deficit this year, is estimated to reduce the deficit in 2015 by 0.6% of GDP.  Cumulatively, the impact of these developments is estimated to be equivalent to about &euro;1.6 billion of additional adjustments over the period 2014-15.  This is based on technical adjustments made by the council to budget 2013 projections.  Given this and assuming full implementation of the Government's planned &euro;5.1 billion in adjustments over 2012-1015, the general Government deficit in 2015 now appears likely to be close to 2% of GDP compared to the official forecast of 2.9%.  <\/p><p>  In our previous assessment report last September the council assessed that the fiscal stance was conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.  However, recognising the uncertainties surrounding growth and credit worthiness at the time we made a case for the need for a further &euro;1.9 billion in additional budgetary adjustments.  We argued that this would provide a margin of safety to ensure the successful achievement of programme targets, given the fragility of the Government's fiscal position.  In this report, taking on board post budget 2013 developments, we are no longer making the case for this additional adjustment.  Given the recent developments, the margin of safety argued for by the council in previous reports has been largely achieved.  However, the Government's planned adjustments of &euro;3.1 billion in 2014 and &euro;2 billion in 2015 should not be reduced.  There is no room for complacency, notwithstanding the recent success in meeting fiscal targets.  Even with the implementation of the planned &euro;5.1 billion in adjustment in 2014-15, analysis by the council suggests there is approximately a one-in-three probability that the deficit to GDP ratio would be above 3% of GDP in 2015 in the absence of offsetting adjustments.<\/p><p>  The fiscal assessment report again highlights the significant challenges remaining on the expenditure side to 2015.  Expenditure pressures in health and social protection in 2012, in part driven by service demand, have underlined the implementation challenge.  The payroll savings envisioned under the Croke Park extension agreement represent a significant component of total planned expenditure reduction.  The macroeconomic environment also remains unusually uncertain.  While there are tentative signs that the domestic economy is stabilising, the external environment - especially in Europe - has weakened since the publication of the budget.<\/p><p>  Budget 2013 projections imply compliance with the national budgetary rule in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  The structural balance, namely, the general Government balance adjusted for the cycle and one-off factors, plays a key role in both domestic and EU rules.  In this report, we have drawn attention to the need for the development of a more comprehensive domestic analysis around estimates of the structural budget balance.  A robust return to State creditworthiness, which has continued to show the improvement highlighted in the September 2012 fiscal assessment report, should be further reinforced by the recently announced extensions to the maturities on EFSF-EFSM loans.  Post-programme precautionary funding arrangements could also help underpin a sustainable return to market funding.<\/p><p>  Again, I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend today.  Since our last appearance, the budgetary outlook has improved and fiscal objectives in 2012 were complied with by a comfortable margin.  However, significant challenges remain.  We look forward to once again hearing the views of members and taking any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366808400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who cannot be present for the entirety of the meeting.  The council's assessment, restated today, is that the planned adjustments of &euro;3.1 billion in 2014 and &euro;2 billion in 2015 should not be reduced.  Given that we are likely to overshoot the runway, so to speak, by going beyond the 3% target, is there a case for easing up by approximately &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million this year in order to give a boost to consumer spending and confidence in the economy?  There appears to be some talk of that and Ministers seem to be rushing to the press with predictions of tax cuts.  Do the council members believe it would be a good idea for the Government to do that?  Would it benefit the economy?<\/p><p>  Professor McHale stated that by 2015 there should be some room for pay increases or tax cuts and increases in social welfare benefits.  What would the council opt for in the in the first instance?<\/p><p>  My next question relates to capital expenditure.  Does the council believe the Government is getting the mix right in regard to current and capital expenditure?  The capital budget was underspent last year by &euro;145 million and the consequences are plain to be seen.  In County Meath and other counties one can see the roads crumbling which has to do with the fact that this money was not spent.  To the end of March 2013 only &euro;387 million was spent on capital projects, which is a very low figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400003#B00400","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366809000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for being clear and concise - I hope everybody can do likewise.

I may call on my colleagues to answer some of them.  He asked whether the planned adjustments of &euro;5.1 billion for 2014 and 2015 should be reduced.  I will recap on the council's analysis in calling for this margin of safety.  It relates to the huge uncertainty about the fiscal picture, in particular uncertainty about growth but also uncertainty relating to the potential for additional bank losses.  While there are many different sources of uncertainty, we have mainly focused on the uncertain growth picture.<\/p><p>  Even with these new developments, including the promissory note deal, based on past forecast errors on growth we project there is about a one in three chance that the target of 3% of GDP will be missed in 2015.  If we could be certain that the 3% target could be achieved, there would be scope for reducing the &euro;5.1 billion in adjustments.  Unfortunately because there is so much uncertainty on growth, to give us the margin of safety to ensure the 3% target will be achieved, we believe it is useful to aim for something closer to 2% of GDP under the central growth forecasts.  Then if there are some adverse growth shocks, we could still meet the target.<\/p><p>  That raises the question of why it is so important to meet the target.  We have seen that Ireland's success in meeting its main fiscal targets has had a very positive effect on Ireland's credit worthiness - ten-year bond yields have now moved down to approximately 3.5%.  There has been considerable success on a key objective of the programme, which was to restore Ireland's borrowing capacity.  Much of that is due to the success in meeting the targets.  Having this additional buffer or margin of safety to ensure we can meet that key 3% target by 2015 keeps us on track in terms of the perception that Ireland's fiscal situation is being brought under control, that the deficit is bring brought down according to plan, and that we are on track to stabilise and start to reduce our debt-GDP ratio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366809000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>If the Government were to introduce measures in the next budget, would that increase uncertainty over us reaching our targets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400004#C00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366809000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>If the Government reduces the planned adjustments, the probability of meeting the 3% target gets reduced.  The Senator mentioned &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million worth of easing relative to that &euro;5.1 billion target.  The central forecast would probably be for a deficit still below 3% of GDP by 2015, but given the huge uncertainty over growth, things do not work out according to those central growth forecasts.  There is still considerable downside risk relating to uncertainties about the balance-sheet recession that is affecting the domestic economy, but also huge uncertainty over the European economy.  So there are still major uncertainties.  To keep things on track and reinforce the progress that has been made already, we believe it is appropriate to keep this margin of safety in place.<\/p><p>  There is good news.  In our previous report we had indicated that additional adjustments beyond the &euro;5.1 billion would have been required to achieve this margin of safety.  There is very welcome news with last year's Exchequer returns coming in somewhat better than had been anticipated in budget 2013, the fact that nominal GDP turned out to be slightly higher than anticipated in the budget, and also the significant effects of the promissory note deal.  These are welcome developments that allow the margin of safety, which we believe to be the wise course, to be in place without having to go beyond the planned &euro;5.1 billion adjustment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366809000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Senator Byrne asked about capital expenditure.  I cannot give a very clear answer, but I can talk about principles and a bit of history.  We all know that in an austerity programme capital spending is the first thing to go.  Obviously it is easier for the Government not to do things than to stop doing the things it is doing.  With the austerity programme in the 1980s there was very little capital investment in that period, which acted as a blockage to economic growth in the late 1980s because the problems became so acute.  We were somewhat lucky because it was in the late 1980s that the European moneys came in and, in a sense, provided the sort of money required to carry out the sort of investment the Senator mentioned.  There is a real concern that politics being politics capital expenditure gets depressed and it could well happen that we overdo it.  We need to be clear and careful that we do not do this.<\/p><p>  What is needed is a much more strategic approach to the austerity programme.  A group such as ours is sometimes concerned that the Government's approach might simply be to make the savings wherever they can be achieved - that it would not be done on a strategic basis, as we would wish, but more in a pragmatic way.  We would be urging that these issues be considered much more carefully than has probably happened to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1366809000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Is the Government's approach to capital expenditure with the undershooting of capital targets a blockage to economic growth, similar to what Professor Barrett described happened in the 1980s?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400004#C00700","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366809000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Ultimately it could be.

It is the council's job to raise awareness about these matters.  The way the Department of Finance does its forecasting and presents its figures is complex and is a bit of a black box.  It is part of the council's job to raise awareness.  For example, in the report the council went to great lengths to explain how the Department makes short-term and medium-term forecasts.  To our knowledge that process has not been documented in Ireland before.  Obviously we examine the accuracy of its forecasts and check for errors.  We knew that the budget was overly pessimistic about the outlook for last year and the error was about 0.5% of GDP.<\/p><p>  Exchequer returns evolve.  The Deputy may have said that they were archaic but the Government has made progress.  Exchequer returns now have an information note attached every month to describe the main developments.  The Department also publishes tax profiles and explains how taxes are relative to profiles.  It has done the same for expenditure in the past.  There have been improvements.  It also an analytical presentation on Exchequer returns.  That is a great advance.  It shows things like PRSI receipts, appropriations-in-aid, non-tax revenues and a lot more details.

Sometimes that is not recognised when people talk about austerity in general.  The report and the council's chairman comments cover austerity in Ireland and I do not have anything much to add.<\/p><p>  Euro-wide austerity is not within the remit of the Irish Fiscal Council.  I shall offer my personal view, one that my colleagues may not share.  When one examines macroeconomics in Europe a case can be made to do more given that there is not much scope for further stimulus arising from monetary policies.  I am not saying that an overwhelming case can be made, just a strong and respectable one.  The northern countries who are not under the same debt constraints could do more by way of fiscal stimulus or they could do less by way of fiscal consolidation.  Quite a number of economists, though not all, share my view, including many with a centrist position and not only the liberal position.

We recognise that a judgment call must be made on how to trade the damage done to the economy by additional fiscal adjustments against the advantages in order to improve the fiscal situation and credit worthiness of the State in the long run.  That is a difficult call to make.  In the reports we made a case for going a bit further in terms of planning adjustments to provide the margin of safety that we talked about before.  We made it very clear that we would not, considering that the Government would be following an imprudent overall policy if it did not follow that particular piece of advice.  That fact has been missed along the way.  <\/p><p>  We have asked the Government to provide a more formal response to our reports.  It began doing that in response to our last report, the Medium Term Fiscal Statement, MTFS, and it will respond accordingly to our most recent report, the Stability Programme Update.

On the fiscal side, under the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, it has a national focus.  It focuses on each country in order to reach budgetary targets but not enough attention has been placed on the overall fiscal stance of the eurozone economy, particularly no real source of pressure is placed on the stronger countries, that Dr. Donal Donovan mentioned, to use their fiscal space.  It could give the eurozone a more expansionary stance which is important for improving Ireland's growth performance and the European economy more generally.<\/p><p>  On the monetary side, the institutional set up of the European Central Bank has almost completely focused on price stability.

The financial crisis devastated balance sheets across the economy, not only the Government's balance sheet but those of financial institutions, businesses and households.

The bad news is the devastating effects of the balance sheet recession.  There were tentative signs last year that the domestic economy was stabilising.  If we compare domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2012 with domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2011, one finds that it was essentially stable in the period.  While stable is nowhere near good enough, given what we had been through, stabilisation is the first step we need to take.  In addition, consumption and investment grew in the second half of 2012 and members will see a pattern of retail sales that was broadly consistent with a stabilisation of domestic demand and the domestic economy.<\/p><p>  There are renewed signs in the early part of 2013 of weakness in retail sales.  It is too early to tell if this is the case and it is hoped the pattern of stabilisation of domestic demand will continue.  Just as the news on domestic demand was getting better, we see a worsening of export performance, ultimately in terms of net exports, as a result of weaknesses in our trading partners, particularly the eurozone and United Kingdom.  The UK's official forecasting agency has revised its growth forecast for the country for 2012 by halving it to 0.6%.  These factors are acting as a drag on the economy and some of this is probably spilling back over to domestic demand.  There are signs, however, that stabilisation is occurring. <\/p><p>  In terms of the distinction between GNP and GDP, growth in the former lagged behind growth in the latter for a number of years.  People viewed this as a sign of weakness in the domestic economy as the difference between GNP and GDP is largely accounted for by the profits of multinational companies.  If the international sector is doing well, profits among these companies will be high.  A significant portion of GDP growth will then be subtracted when calculating GNP, which is, therefore, reduced.  That this did not occur last year, when GNP grew, indicates that, based on the type of analysis that has been applied, there has been a strengthening of the domestic economy.  As it happens, I would not read too much into these figures in terms of them being a positive sign.  It seems certain that multinational companies are now domiciling themselves in Ireland.  As a result, their profits are now considered an inflow of profits, which skews the numbers.  There is considerable noise at present in these international income flow statistics.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366810200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Are these figures a one-off event?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400006#E00600","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>We will have to wait and see.

Given that investment may increase or decrease this year, what is required?  The majority of the people in Ireland are employed in the domestic economy.  If we are to deal with the issue of unemployment, the key driver will come from the domestic economy.  FDI is extremely important in providing employment but how do we get to the point where consumption increases, the domestic economy recovers and the banks lend for entrepreneurial projects?  The banks will lend for a gilt edged project but we have to create an entrepreneurial culture so that people create employment.  We seem to face the same question every year.  We are dealing with people in the domestic economy who employ three, four or ten staff.  They are struggling.  We have had the macro discussion but I want to get to the real discussion.

We were in a situation where the vicious feedback loops between the banking system, the real economy and the public finances were driving the economy downwards and a key first step had to be restoring the creditworthiness of the State.  Matters might have become significantly worse if that stabilisation had not occurred.  Having said that, however, there is no doubt that SMEs are facing a difficult situation at present.  The credit system is broken to a significant extent, in respect of the balance sheets problems of both the banks and business.  Although the banks have been substantially recapitalised, they remain highly risk averse in the context of the uncertainties on the asset side of their balance sheets to which Deputy Mathews adverted.  The Central Bank has also reported that 50% of SME loans are impaired, which is a legacy of the past.  Many of these loans were associated with property-related borrowing.  However these debts were incurred, they affect the creditworthiness of SMEs when they try to fund projects.  As Deputy O'Donnell noted, a decent number of these projects potentially offer high returns but a legacy of past debt makes a company uncreditworthy even in respect of financing new and attractive projects.  There certainly is a problem in the credit system and significant efforts are required to address it.<\/p><p>  At the risk of saying something with which certain people will disagree, the win-win opportunities for restructuring debt are probably much larger in the SME sector than with mortgage debt.  There is a general idea that the solutions exist for mortgage debt and if we only proceed with them, everybody will gain.  The banks would gain by writing down debt and the mortgage holder also gains.  It is much harder in the case of mortgage debt to achieve those win-win solutions, however, because in effect the bank is giving up an option in the hope that by reducing debt it will change incentives, possibly to earn more income, so that it ends up getting paid more.  Those opportunities exist but they are scarce.  SMEs are in a different position, however, because of the legacy of these debts from the past.  SMEs have opportunities for profitable investments but they are not creditworthy because of this overhang of debt from the past.  The possibility is higher for restructuring those debts in a way that will ultimately be good for the bank and the small business.<\/p><p>  In terms of pressing things forward in a way that supports investment in the domestic economy and, ultimately, in jobs, it is important that we deal with the lack of credit flow to SMEs as a priority.  This is not only a domestic issue because initiatives could also be taken at European level, such as supports from the European Investment Bank and, ultimately, the European Central Bank, for SMEs.  This is a problem that needs urgent attention if we are to get the domestic economy going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400007#F01100","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810800,"counter":527,"content":"<p>The great problem for Ireland is how we get the domestic economy going but history will show that in the absence of a buoyant international economy it is next to impossible to do this.

I am glad the Government did not accept its recommendation at that time.  I see in this report, the members of the IFAC are suggesting the Government continues with the adjustment path in spite of the fact that a further &euro;1.6 billion adjustment may not be required to reach the 3% target.

He made the point about our shaky start.  It is true that between the report that issued in September and our most recent report, the situation changed so that the additional adjustments beyond the Government's plan for which we had made a case were no longer required.  We had to see what facts changed and whether we should have foreseen them.  The main change was the promissory note deal.  I do not think we could have been expected to have been in a position to anticipate the nature of that deal and as members will recall it was highly uncertain as to whether it would take place at all.  Our basic thinking and the strategy we have been recommending, which is to have a margin of safety in place, has not changed but as certain facts changed the way the strategy gets translated into actual advice about the fiscal policy stands will change.  I know people perceive us to have been wrong but I do not see how we could have anticipated what the savings on the promissory note deal would have been.  I think it would be much worse, if in order not to make a mistake we just kept making the same advice even though the facts had changed.  I do not accept that we have got off to a shaky start in terms of getting it wrong on that dimension.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right that austerity is having a significant negative impact on many people's lives.  Nobody should recommend it lightly, given the pain that it causes.  We must recognise that as bad as things are, if they are badly managed they could get substantially worse.  In order to be able to phase the adjustment out over time, we need to be able to borrow.  For a number of years we had not been able to borrow until quite recently from the financial markets so we were relying on official lenders.  To remain creditworthy with the official lenders, we had to meet the conditions.  To ensure one meets those conditions in a highly uncertain environment creates an argument for having some buffer in place.  The important point is that the reason we are arguing for this margin of safety is to ensure we do not reach a situation in which we lose our ability to borrow when that ability to borrow is so critical to maintaining social spending, social protection, social services and so on.  In terms of what matters in people's lives and avoiding imposing pain on them, I think we agree on the end point, which is to find the best way to ensure that as bad as things are at present, we do not take a risk of them getting much worse and we stay on a path to improving the situation.  To respond to Deputy O'Donnell's question, we are starting to see positives.  We have had two years of positive growth and while I accept the rate is far too low, we see signs of domestic demand stabilising.  In terms of what the austerity programme set out to do, which was to get control of the public finances, bring down the deficit, initially stabilise the debt and then put it on a downward path and regain the creditworthiness of the State, in the middle of 2011 the bond yield was 15% whereas it is now down below 4%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366811400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I am well aware of that.

He was part of the troika mission.  He was not the head of mission; that was Mr. Chopra.  I wish to correct that point for the record.  He was one of a team of ten.  When Mr. Mody retired from the IMF about six months ago, he gave an interview, which is slightly unusual because civil servants typically do not in general discuss all of the details of the decisions that were taken which involved ultimately political decisions by the head of the IMF, subject to the board of the IMF, which is itself a politically appointed board.  In my experience that is a little bit unusual anywhere.  That is one point.<\/p><p>  Looking at the substance of what was said, Mr. Mody said that there were three options as he described it.  The first was to burn senior bondholders, the second was the provision of long-term concessional assistance and the third was austerity.  The way it came across was that it was all austerity and that austerity was a bad thing.  We know about the bondholder story.  There were debates at the time of the bailout and we know it was the intervention of the United States in the form of the US Treasury Secretary, not the ECB, who decided for good or bad, taking into account worldwide considerations.  I am not trying to say it was right or wrong.  That was decided by the IMF not to be an option.<\/p><p>  I am a little puzzled by the second option because in November 2010 I do not think anybody was offering this country long-term concessional assistance.  It certainly was not the IMF because it does not offer long-term concessional assistance to any country except the poorest countries in Africa.  We are not and hope not to be in a situation such as Mali, which is the type of country that receives long-term concessional assistance.  I do not think Chancellor Merkel and German taxpayers were willing to provide this country with long-term concessional assistance in November 2010.  I found it a little odd that this option was suggested because I do not see it as an option and I certainly was not around at the time.

I find that hard to believe because I do not think anyone said that with a deficit of 11% of GDP - or 32%, depending on which year one calculates it - that we did not need to reduce our deficit, and the debt to GDP ratio was heading towards 120%.  Of course one may argue on the margin as to whether the speed was too fast or too slow, as we are discussing today.  The impression that came across, which I believe was wrong, was that austerity was imposed because the other two options should have been considered but were not and that austerity is a bad thing.  That is wrong because regardless of anything, even burning senior bondholders, we would still have needed to reduce an unsustainable deficit from 12% down to 3% or other level.

I acknowledge the Vice Chairman has being generous with his time.  I have two further brief questions.  Earlier, Professor McHale mentioned that the council had not factored in the taking on of the promissory notes as sovereign debt over a longer period and the impossibility of so doing.  The Government continues to claim it is arguing for the retroactive recapitalisation of the banks through the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  Might the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council examine a number of scenarios as to how that might affect Ireland's deficit and the projections to 2015?  Were such an occasion to arise, in which the ESM recapitalised the banks and we got back that money, the witnesses could appear before this joint committee stating we now needed to readjust.  Can some forward thinking be done in this regard and would the council be willing to model it?<\/p><p>  Before coming to my final question, I wish to make a point on one-off events such as the sale of the 4G network and so on.  Is there a way to isolate one-off events when considering the deficit figures?  My final point concerns the stimulus debate and I am glad the council has started to open up this debate.  Despite not agreeing with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's major headline regarding the current path, I note its function is to provide advice, analysis and data.  The key point in this regard is that the council is independent and this is the point at which I have something of an issue with this report.  For example, in the context of the debate on the multiplier, the council has simply accepted the Government's model.  What independent analysis has the council undertaken on the Government's model?  While the council notes the extant literature and makes reference to the work of Professor Philip Lane, as well as to other models from the IMF and the Commission, it has come down strongly in favour of the Government's own model and its fiscal multiplier of 0.5.  Moreover, the council has provided single year and single digit figures for multipliers in its report whereas, as the witnesses are aware, all the international literature states multipliers have a multi-year effect.  However, the council does not outline this point.  For example, the B&eacute;n&eacute;trix-Lane model has an average multiplier of four in the first four years, whereas according to the council's report, the B&eacute;n&eacute;trix-Lane model has a multiplier of 0.7 in the first year and that it turns negative in the third year.  I am not 100% sure that is accurate.  Moreover, there are other models and one could consider the analysis carried out by Bradley and Morgenroth on the multiplier in the south from European Union Structural Funds.  They got an average of 2.88 in the long run but yet the council is opting for a figure of 0.5.  The key to being an independent fiscal advisory council is that there is independent analysis but I am concerned the council has simply chosen the Government's multiplier in this debate.  What independent analysis has the council carried out in this regard?<\/p><p>  I also wish to discuss the ESRI's HERMES macroeconomic model.  As a statutory body, would it be appropriate for the council to publish when it makes reference to that model?  In the context of the HERMES model, when one considers an adjustment of &euro;1 billion in terms of the deficit, do the witnesses agree that tax increases are the best way to reduce the deficit instead of expenditure cuts?  If one examines the six areas the council has chosen, public sector pay cuts are the least effective way to reduce the deficit.  I asked the witnesses to comment on some of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400010#J00100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1366812600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Before Professor McHale responds, I must ask for the answers to be short and concise because we have run on a little timewise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400010#J00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366812600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Having conferred, Professor John McHale will engage with the multiplier questions, which are very important.  As for the scenarios around the things that are hard to model but which can have an impact, such as the promissory notes previously, and obviously other issues concerning the ESM in particular, we have looked at those things a little.  We have also looked internally at some scenarios.  However, for the promissory note deal in particular, it was so complex that we thought it was not really helpful.  Before we knew what was the actual deal it was very difficult because there were so many scenarios one could consider.  We did not really have the full information.  However, we certainly would think about taking on the Deputy's suggestion in the future, which is very helpful.  Moreover, to do a little bit of advertising for our future work, Mr. Diarmaid Smyth and I soon will publish a paper that takes a comprehensive perspective on the Government's balance sheet.  While I will not promise the Deputy that it will include scenarios, it will examine these general issues and is a way of trying to inform the debate because these issues are very complicated to think about.  The use of scenarios is a good way to deal with problems when one does not know what is the probability but there is an impact and they are useful to have in the back of one's mind.  As I stated, it was particularly difficult with the promissory notes because there were so many different things one could envisage.  In addition, we were aware of the sensitivity of those discussions and consequently, it is right for the council to be cautious in that area.<\/p><p>  As for the impact of the universal mobile telecommunications system, UMTS, licences, these are identified as one-offs in the data and, consequently, we try to look through that in our analysis of structural balances and the like.  While I think it was documented anyway, our report also documents what were the Government's assumptions about that.  It assumed it would be less than it actually was, which probably is a sensible approach to take, that is, to not spend money one is not really sure of getting and obviously there also were commercial issues.  While we will continue to consider the validity of these assumptions and whether we think they are making reasonable judgments in these kinds of difficult situations, it is very hard to call the valuation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366812600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>On the multiplier question, as the Deputy will have seen, the council provided quite a comprehensive treatment of multipliers here, including a review of related literature, both domestic and international.  We also have reviewed the recent debate that has been taking place between the financial institutions about multipliers that was kicked off by the IMF analysis indicating it may have been underestimating multipliers for a number of countries.  Moreover, because of the uncertainty that exists in respect of multipliers, we have carried out a sensitivity analysis on the budgetary projections, based on alternative multipliers.  Consequently, while based on our reading of the evidence, we saw no reason to think the overall deficit multiplier of 0.5 was not in the right ballpark.  I acknowledge there always will be uncertainties around that but even in the case of the IMF analysis, its analysis did not point to an underestimation in the Irish case.  In addition, while recognising that at present there are different factors affecting the Irish multiplier, a review of the literature shows on the one hand that economies in recession and coming out of financial crises tend to have higher multipliers.  On the other hand, countries with high debt levels, particularly countries undergoing a creditworthiness crisis, tend to have low multipliers.  I refer to a highly influential study that has got a lot of attention for showing that multipliers are larger in recession.  It actually shows the net effect of having a 100% debt-to-GDP ratio and being in a recession is a multiplier of close to zero.  Based on the totality of the evidence, however, I do not believe this to be true.  I believe there truly is a positive deficit multiplier in the Irish case.  However, looking carefully at the evidence, limited though it is in terms of specific studies focusing on Ireland, there did not appear to be a reason to believe there was an obvious bias in terms of the estimate of a multiplier of 0.5.  However, there is huge uncertainty, which is the reason the sensitivity analysis was important, in order that people who had different views could plug their multiplier in there and find out what would be the effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366812600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I refer to the B&eacute;n&eacute;trix-Lane model, which studies the impact of a shock to the system.

The key numbers coming from that are the numbers equivalent to the fiscal adjustment numbers we have become so used to, the &euro;3.5 billion for this year, the &euro;3.1 billion for 2014 and the &euro;2 billion for 2015.

The comments made in the debate generated here over the past two weeks about quantitative easing have been like a broken record.  It has been said that austerity is not the only way and that we must have a level of quantitative easing because there is a knock-on effect for the Germans, the French and everybody else if we do not consume their goods.  As the Chairman said a while ago, the other large economies of the world have commenced quantitative easing and in order to give ourselves a relative advantage, we need to get to that position.  I have been advocating for this for two years, but the debate at European level seems to have kicked off that we cannot keep imposing further austerity.  The Government would like to be finished with austerity as soon as possible, but if there is quantitative easing of any size, what kind of effect will that have on our economy?<\/p><p>  I have another question related to forecasting.

Will it be positive?  How will we deal with the recapitalising of the banks in order to have the write-down or write-off to which the professor referred?  Also, we were told that in a prudent economy, some 6% of GDP should be held in savings at any point in time.  At the height of the boom we held approximately 2%, and now we are being told we are at approximately 15%.  People are being overly conservative with regard to how they approach the savings model currently.  In terms of forecasting, the professor mentioned a probability of 1 in 3 of getting to 3% of GDP, a 33% chance.  That is a conservative outlook.  However if quantitative easing kicks in and we have a little more disposable income in the economy and if people start to release their savings and spend, how much of an impact will that have on finishing with austerity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400011#K00800","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes will begin with the question on quantitative easing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400011#K00900","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Quantitative easing is a very relevant issue.  However, with quantitative easing central banks are essentially in unknown territory and as economists we are very uncertain about how and whether it works.  Before we get there, the ECB should use its existing policy space to cut rates from their current levels.  I do not think this will make a huge difference, but it will help.  It would particularly help banks that are having to lend at the main re-financing rate of the ECB, not in the market, particularly in peripheral countries.  For that reason, rather than for the overall reduction, this would be useful.<\/p><p>  At the same time, a key problem in Europe is that even if they cut the rates, the monetary transmission mechanism is basically broken.  Therefore, we see massive spreads to real economy lending and difficult credit conditions in many countries, including Ireland.  The ECB, through its operations, has done a lot already to help in that regard, but it has not gone far enough.  The ECB needs to look at ways of helping credit for small businesses and a range of other measures that one might think would have a quantitative easing aspect but which are really aimed at trying to get monetary transmission working again.  In this respect, a key message is that the ECB needs to follow its mandate more carefully.<\/p><p>  There is discussion with the US regarding a joint jobs growth and inflation mandate, but in Europe core inflation is 1%.  It has been 1% for a long time and predictably it will remain at 1% unless they do something about it.  I believe it is not about asking the ECB to do anything.  It does not need to change the mandate, but it needs to take the actions required to meet its existing mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400011#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1366813800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>What effect would the implementation of a little quantitative easing over the next two years have if it was just simply targeted at the peripheral regions in the form of credit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400012#L00100","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Over and above these issues that are aimed at trying to make monetary union come together more, there is a need to ease overall monetary policy generally.  This is my view rather than necessarily that of my colleagues or my employers.  In that context, it is long past time in Europe to engage in quantitative easing programmes.  As economists, we know very little about how quantitative easing works.  In particular, it is clear that it has an impact on banks' balance sheets but whether that translates into things in the real economy and how it is supposed to translate is very uncertain and, therefore, to some extent, it is a bit of a leap in the dark.  We know that it seems to have an impact on exchange rates and the strength of the euro, which is unhelpful to Irish businesses.  This is in no small part due to the fact that we have not engaged in quantitative easing.  That is also relevant to the exchange rate against sterling.  The UK example shows that depreciation does not necessarily create miracles for export performance.  Hopefully, Ireland will be better placed to profit from that but it is difficult.  All central banks are in the mode of trying to use unconventional policies, whatever they may be, to push things forward.  The exchange rate will clearly help in the Irish case but we should not expect miracles because these are policies that are untested and untried and we do not understand their impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>It is useful to look directly at the Irish banking system and ask what is the nature of the problem and whether quantitative easing will have any impact.  Indirectly, as Mr. Barnes pointed out, it could have a broad, euro-wide impact in terms of improving activity but in the case of the Irish banking system, at least as I understand it, the issue is not one of lack of liquidity - it is not as though the Irish banks do not have money to lend - it is that they do not wish to lend for various reasons as they are constrained.  The pressures exercised by the Central Bank and the Government in strongly urging the banks to engage with their customers - households, SMEs, buy to let and so on - to address the problem of debt arrears is extremely important.  This is not just a question of getting the banks to recognise the reality of their situation, use up the capital they have to make provisions, which they should have done earlier, and write their balance sheets to make them look better.<\/p><p>  There are economic advantages.  The first is huge numbers of people in the banks now are devoting themselves to looking after arrears, chasing up money from people and so on.  The sooner they deal with this and get it over with, the sooner they can go back to doing their real business, which is to lend money to creditworthy people but it has become an all-consuming exercise for many of the banks.  The second advantage, to which Mr. McHale referred earlier, is there is huge uncertainty among lenders and borrowers as to the true status of the borrowers financial situation because in the absence of sorting this out, which may mean write-offs or whatever, nobody quite knows whether SMEs or households are in a position to borrow.  We do not know how creditworthy they are but once we sort it out, park or write down some of the debt, it will be better.<\/p><p>  The third advantage, which is often forgotten, is foreigners who are thinking positively of coming back into Ireland and investing in Irish banks do not see the banks recognising these losses.  They worry that the losses that could be out there are large - greater than have even been allowed for by the bank recapitalisation by the Government.  Naturally, if they do not know, they think the worst but if the losses are crystallised and if as seems not unlikely they will turn out to be broadly consistent, though one cannot be sure, with the provisions for which there is capital, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief because we will know where we are and they can go back into profitable Irish banks and start doing business.<\/p><p>  I see these as the key issues rather than worrying too much about the quantitative easing at European level because it is a bit academic from Ireland's direct point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366813800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>If we think that there are elements outside of our control, which could go in our favour, what is the general thinking on front-loading versus back-loading the adjustments domestically?

It would not become a bonanza and we would not quite be back in clover, as the phrase is.  It would be when this really tough period would start to stop.

The most striking thing I took from the recent report was the graph showing the quarterly revision downwards of 2012 GDP growth by everybody.  This is a clear inherent bias towards optimism.  In the budget for 2013 the Department of Finance projects 1.5% for this year, 2.5% for next year and 2.9% for 2015, which is exactly the type of thing we see every time, that it was rough last year but there will be growth of basis points in the coming years and it will all be gravy.<\/p><p>  The eurozone is back in recession and the forecasts are that it will stay in negative growth for a while.  The UK is in serious trouble.  The US is growing, thank goodness, and I believe the figure is approximately 2%.  The advisory council's figures for 2012 show the number of people at work has fallen and we had negative growth last year again.  Unemployment figures have fallen, but this is obviously because people are either retiring or leaving the country.  For this year and the following two years we will still be in fiscal consolidation and a lot of pain is still to be had.  As the witnesses have pointed out repeatedly, the trading environment is hugely difficult, and yet the Department of Finance is once again stating we will get a lovely hockey stick this year, next year and the following year.

There are real questions about some of the policies being pursued, particularly in the eurozone, which are certainly not helping the situation in terms of the growth of the eurozone economy.

In terms of the recent forecast of a stabilisation in domestic demand, which had been made in previous years also and was not well underpinned given what we could see happening with the balance sheet recession, there is more evidence now that this stabilisation is finally beginning to take place.

I agree that the Department of Finance has not been politicised in its forecasts and I accept that there is no way to get the forecasts right, as there are two many large unknowns, but the logic that we have heard for ages is that the austerity-only approach can work if we have sufficient growth.  Obviously, there will be no growth in the country because we are taking everyone's money, but we are told not to worry because we will be able to export to the eurozone and the UK.  Here the narrative seems to stop, but those countries are taking their citizens' money as well, so they will probably not be able to buy our stuff.  It seems to have come as a great surprise that our trade partners, which are suffering fiscal consolidation challenges similar to our own, are not buying our exports any more than we are.  That these two elements were not joined up surprises me.<\/p><p>  Regarding a technical point on GDP growth, and while I have nothing to support it, it was put to me by an economist who examined the issue that some or all of the growth has been due to perfectly legal tax optimisation by firms.  We referenced this matter when Deputy McDonald discussed the bizarre anomaly of a growth in real GNP of 3.4% versus a 0.9% growth in real GDP.  Legal issues are involved, in that companies have reregistered as being domiciled in Ireland, presumably for tax reasons.  Has the council examined how much, if any, of the growth is due to tax optimisation?  Companies are here, at least partly, for tax reasons.  In recessions, large and small companies focus heavily on tax optimisation because they cannot grow.  It is a way to increase profits.  Has an analysis been conducted or has the council seen evidence to suggest that a chunk of the growth is not reflected in the real economy but is instead legal tax optimisation by companies based in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366815600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>In terms of tax optimisation, the usual concern is that it might distort GDP, which includes the profits of the multinationals.  If they set up their operations and engaged in practices such as the transfer of pricing, they could distort their profits for tax reasons in a way that then distorts GDP.  This is one reason for people examining GNP, which subtracts multinationals' profits.  As mentioned, GNP grew strongly last year and is projected to grow less than GDP this year.  These are some of the issues around Ireland's national accounts.<\/p><p>  In terms of GNP, there are issues concerning how account is taken of royalties in the services sector.  There is strong export growth in the software sector, boosting GDP and GNP, but this seems to be largely offset by high royalty payments, as the intellectual properties are owned by companies' head offices.  Therefore, the royalties show up as high imports, in which instance they probably do not even distort GDP.  While these are issues, we have not come across evidence of a significant bias to make us doubt the GNP figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366815600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I am more concerned by the GDP distortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366815600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>There is a greater concern in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366815600,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnelly should conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1366815600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>The average time that other members received was approximately 25 minutes, but I have only received 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00800","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1366815600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400015#O00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1366815600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I am the fifth questioner.

Professor McHale stated in his presentation that the balance sheet recession shadows everything not alone in Ireland, but abroad.  I have been saying that since 2009, including officially on paper to the late Brian Lenihan, in which I predicted that the heads of balance of the six main banks, their liabilities and assets would be not less than &euro;40 billion.  He would have thought I was on drugs had I told him what I really believed, namely, that there would be a minimum of &euro;50 billion on NAMA-type loan losses.  I also told him that the proposition as designed, the purpose of which was to restore the solvency-liquidity of the banks, would not work, and what I believed needed to be done with the banks.<\/p><p>  As Dr. Donovan stated earlier, the banks need capability to address the problem which has only belatedly been admitted, the scale of which is 180,000 mortgages on top of what they shipped out to NAMA.  When Bank of Ireland did its bill of lading to NAMA, it reduced its first estimate from &euro;18 billion to &euro;12 billion.  How it did that in three months I do not know.  It would have had, on average, 35% write-downs or provisions on that &euro;12 billion.  The remainder of Bank of Ireland's loan book - it may have an update on these figures which I obtained from it last year - is &euro;105 billion.  Its provision against that &euro;105 billion is &euro;7 billion, which is a 6.7% provision.  That is absurd.  I will explain why.  Bank of Scotland Ireland had a peaked loan book of &euro;42 billion.  It has written off 40% of that.  That percentage includes loans that would have gone to NAMA but did not and had to be written off within Bank of Scotland Ireland's books.  Bank of Ireland's loan book of &euro;105 billion includes &euro;81 billion in the following categories of development land loans, development loans, property investment loans, mortgage loans, mortgage-to-let loans and construction industry exposure, yet it has made only &euro;7 billion in provision against that &euro;81 million.<\/p><p>  PCAR of March 2011 is as unreliable as PCAR March 2010.  I told Mr. Elderfield in his office in April 2010 that the &euro;7.4 billion pencilled in as needed for AIB by the end of that year was absurd and that it needed &euro;10 million immediately and that the figure of &euro;3.6 billion in respect of Bank of Ireland was equally stupid because it needed &euro;6.5 billion immediately.  If we have a balance sheet problem in the economy, we should, as set out in the council's mandate, ensure the needle on the dial is aimed towards 3% of GDP by 2015.  We hope in the long term to get debt to GDP down to 60%.  During the past four years it has increased to &euro;104 billion and is now spinning out of control.  The paper by Cecchetti, Mohanty, Zampolli and Jackson Hole states that the real effects of debt over 28 years in the 18 OECD countries were indicative of when economies stagnate.  Household debt is that which holds people back from spending, saving and investing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400016#P01300","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366816800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400017#Q00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1366816800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>This is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and this is a policy matter for the country; it hit the entire economy for seven years because of the banking sector and the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400017#Q00300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366816800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I would like to make a very brief comment.

One basic requirement is that the debt stops rising as a share of the economy.  It looks as though the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 123% of GDP this year, a bit higher than originally thought, partly because the Government is building up quite large cash balances, which could rise to as much as &euro;30 billion.  On that criterion, it looks as if sustainability will be achieved.<\/p><p>  The more basic measure of sustainability is funding the debt when it must be rolled over and, if it is being added to through deficits, whether those can be funded.  The eurozone crisis has revealed the fragility of a country's debt sustainability within the eurozone.  Probably it will remain fragile at debt levels as a share of GDP that are quite a bit lower than 120%.  If we did not have access to official lending, either actual or potential, through a precautionary programme or a full programme, Ireland's debt would probably not be refundable at anywhere close to the debt-to-GDP ratios we currently have.  That is why retaining our creditworthiness with those official funders is so important to ensuring we can sustain that debt and not be forced into a default and a much more severe programme of austerity.<\/p><p>  This is why, going back to the theme the Deputy raised about the uncertainty around these forecasts, given that uncertainty, we have argued for this margin of safety to make sure we can at least stop the debt-to-GDP ratio from rising.  Already, even with the additional planned adjustments of &euro;5.1 billion up to 2015, we estimate there is a one in four chance the debt-to-GDP ratio will not have stopped rising by 2015 if there are negative shocks to growth.  It is still very much on the edge but to the extent that we can put that margin of safety in place, we can reduce the probability that the debt-to-GDP ratio will not have stabilised.  That goes back to why we are making the argument for having that margin of safety in place to ensure we can maximise the chances of debt sustainability and minimise the chances of the disruptive effects of default and further austerity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400020#T00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366818300,"counter":667,"content":"<p>The work the council does is very much appreciated and I find it challenging when it comes before the committee.

The specific point we make in the report is that when one looks at the official estimates of potential output, they seem to understate how deep the cyclical problems are now.  The main component of that, at least in what the European Commission does, seems to relate to unemployment, where it interprets all the unemployment that exists today as being structural.  It seems to us that is implausible.  There is clearly a cyclical effect there.  It does point to the fact, once again - we always say there is a lot of uncertainty around this - that structural unemployment is likely to be higher than it was in the past, particularly because of job losses, for example in the construction sector where there is a category of people and skills that are unlikely to be required in the same numbers in the future.  In terms of public policy, that points to an important conclusion that labour market policies should work effectively and that a solution should be found for this group of people, whom it will be difficult to reintegrate into other jobs.  It points to an area of some public policy effort or spending that should be prioritised because it is very important that unemployment does not become hard-wired.  We must ensure that at some point those people start paying taxes again and stop relying on benefits.  There is a policy conclusion from that.<\/p><p>  I know the property tax is a very sensitive issue in Ireland.  From the perspective of the OECD, which is my day job, property taxes are seen as a form of taxation that has a number of benefits.  Most countries apply property taxes.

This goes to the essence of the trade-off we examined when we assessed the fiscal statistics.  If one was to reduce the adjustments by &euro;1.6 billion, that would probably improve nominal GDP in the case of our model by &euro;800 million.  That certainly would be a significant benefit.  Currently we estimate that there is approximately a one in three chance, as I mentioned earlier, that the 3% target will not be hit, even if one makes the adjustments of &euro;5.1 billion.  That would probably rise - my colleague Mr. Diarmaid Smyth might remember the exact number - by approximately ten percentage points, which gives close to a 50% chance of not meeting that target.  That is the trade-off one is looking at.  The costs associated with not meeting the target would be greater if it were the result of our not implementing the plan to which we initially agreed.  It would compound the fact that we had missed the targets if the reason was not just adverse growth but non-implementation of the plan that had been set out and agreed.<\/p><p>  These are judgment calls, and there are trade-offs to be made.  We absolutely understand that people may weigh these things differently, but given what we have achieved so far in the programme in terms of regaining the creditworthiness of the State and ensuring the State has the borrowing capacity that it needs, it would be a pity to risk those gains more than we need to.  There is risk because of the uncertainly around the growth picture; however, the risk of not following through on the planned adjustment in our judgment is a risk that at this point is not worth taking.  If the growth picture were to turn out better and it looked as though we would meet the target with fewer adjustments, that is something that could be considered as we got closer to the end of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400021#U00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366818900,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I will make a quick point on property taxes.

Among the suite of taxes that one might choose, the point Mr. Barnes was making is that most economists would say, and the analysis shows, that in terms of economic efficiency a property tax is a good way to go.  The real arguments against property tax are the distributional issues and the question of whether it is a fair tax.  There is general agreement that economically it is a sensible tax, but one can make a very good case for saying it is not a fair tax.  Of course, one of the great dilemmas of property tax is how to make it fairer by trying to relate it to income in some form.  For instance, one gives exemptions for low-income people, but once one starts to do that the property tax starts to look like an income tax, so one loses some of the benefits.

That is the kind of thing that should be built on in the future so that we can try to have a clearer idea of where the economy is heading by thinking more carefully about how it will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400021#U01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366818900,"counter":684,"content":"<p>We have examined the impact of possible stronger growth and its effect on the deficit.

I always find our engagements interesting.  The council's reports contain weeks of reading.  The information is always interesting.  I want to follow up on the questions asked by Deputy Humphreys by asking about alternatives that could be considered.  I apologise for not being here for the entire meeting as I wanted to be.  I was in and out of the D&aacute;il.  When we propose alternatives to property taxes or cuts in public expenditure, for example by suggesting that the rate of tax imposed on those on higher incomes or corporation tax should be increased, we are usually rubbished as living in cloud-cuckoo land and told we are engaging in fantasy economics.  The debate does not go much further than that.  Frankly, that does the debate a disservice.<\/p><p>  What would the witnesses say in response to the proposition that we need to look at alternative scenarios, particularly given that pretty mainstream people - even bondholders quite recently - are now saying that austerity has reached its limits and is potentially becoming counter-productive as it is applied across Europe?  One of the big trading houses - I think it is called Pimco - recently said that the effect of austerity on growth is worrying.  This is one of the entities that is dictating our future.  The same people who panicked because we were not imposing enough austerity are potentially going to panic because we have imposed too much austerity and it could cripple growth.<\/p><p>  Is the council looking at alternative scenarios as part of its monitoring of our macroeconomic strategy?  What would it say?  Our view, following on from what Professor Barrett said, is that all taxes are taxes on income.  What would the witnesses say to that?  We do not think there is a dichotomy between fairness and economic efficiency.  We would say that if something is fair, by definition, it will be more efficient.  What would the witnesses say in response to that proposition?  We are dealing with human beings rather than with abstract categories.  If one is fairer, one will motivate people to do more and to generate more economic activity and growth.  If one is unfair, one will demoralise and depress people and, in the process, depress the economy which they comprise.  In light of that analysis, should we not explore whether we should use redistributive taxes such as corporation tax and higher income taxes to take back some of the money that is locked up at the top of the economy and put it back into investment, growth and employment measures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400022#V00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366819500,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Donovan to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400022#V00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1366819500,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I am not asking the witnesses to agree with me.

One can conclude, as the Government and the council have clearly done, that austerity in the sense of reducing the budget deficit by a certain amount over time - one can argue about the amount and the timeframe - is desirable for all the reasons we have been talking about this afternoon.  In my view, the question of the fairest and most efficient way of achieving this is a different one.  This is where I think a given amount of austerity can be achieved in a fair and equitable way.  I think this is what Deputy Boyd Barrett was emphasising, to a large extent.  As economists, we are not particularly great at what we do.  We are not politicians.  We cannot make social choices that have to be made by politicians.  One man's fairness is another man's unfairness.  One man's level of income at a certain tax rate might be considered too high by another man.  Decisions on these matters have ultimately been made by every government, including the Irish Government, over the recent period.  I have a personal view, as everyone sitting here probably does.  As an economist, it is not relevant.  As a citizen, it is.  I vote for whoever happens to belong to my persuasion.<\/p><p>  The fiscal council has been quite careful about this.  We have thought about it a lot.  We do not believe our role involves entering into the composition of taxation or expenditure from a fairness or equity point of view.  It is not actually in the mandate that was given to us.  Obviously, that debate is carried out in a different forum.  We all have personal views.  As a council, we do not have a position.  Efficiency issues are slightly in between.  It is more of an area for an economist than for Joe Citizen.  There are questions of when taxation becomes inefficient in terms of growth, etc.  The council has not gone there either because when one talks about the merits of high or low income taxation, it is usually rather difficult to sort the issues relating to fairness and equity and the personal views one might have about the money people should earn net of taxes from the issues of efficiency and the question of whether an income tax rate of a certain level will have adverse effects on growth.  That is a very slippery area.  For that reason, the council has decided not to go there.  It would involve getting into a very political debate.  There might be some economics in it, but there would be an awful lot of politics and many social views in it.  That is not our space.  I do not know whether that helps the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400022#V00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366819500,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I would like to elaborate on this question a little.

It seems to me that the council believes it has a role in examining what might happen if we do not make the adjustment.  It considers whether we might meet certain targets.  The issue of unemployment is considered when it is making its projections.  It looks at what certain decisions might do to the rate of unemployment.  That is where it begins to get tricky.  I would argue - it is just my view - that if we took an additional &euro;4 billion in tax from the corporate sector instead of taking it from low and middle income workers, and if we invested &euro;4 billion in public works programmes to develop renewable energy, forestry or generic medicines, to give three examples, this would be a far more efficient form of expenditure and would have a positive impact on our deficit, unemployment, etc.  Why would the council not look at that, given that it looks at why we must make cuts in public expenditure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013042400022#V00700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366819500,"counter":692,"content":"<p>The answer from my perspective is that it would involve a debate about issues which might be relatively clearcut, from the Deputy's point of view, but would not be clearcut in a broader sense.

The first item on today's agenda is a discussion with representatives of the Centre for Global Development at UCC about the work of their organisation.  On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome them.<\/p><p>  This meeting has resulted from an invitation I received to launch a book, <i>What in the World?<\/i>, which was written by Mr. Peadar King, who attended a meeting of the joint committee some time ago.

I felt it would be appropriate to invite them to come before the committee to talk about the contribution they make and the courses they offer.  We are delighted to have a strong team of five members of the centre in attendance: Professor Patrick Fitzpatrick, who is the director of the centre and the head of UCC's college of science, engineering and food science; Dr. Edward Lahiff of UCC's college of business and law; Dr. Simon Woodworth of the health information systems research centre and the college of business and law at UCC; Dr. Paul Conway, who is an associate director of Centre for Global Development; and Professor Tony Ryan of the UCC college of medicine and health.  We are delighted that such a strong team has come from UCC to this meeting of the joint committee.  There is a good turnout of members in attendance this afternoon.<\/p><p>  The Centre for Global Development is the vehicle for UCC's global development strategy.  It allows UCC to achieve its ambition to seek a global context for its activities.  The centre also provides a focus for shared interest, experience and expertise in global development in a collaborative interdisciplinary environment.  It enables those involved to stimulate new initiatives in teaching, learning, research and community engagement.  In fact, many of those who work in the development are graduates of the relevant course at UCC.  I know that many of those who work for Irish Aid came through the UCC system.  We are pleased to have representatives of UCC with us.  As they know, we work with Irish Aid as an integral part of the work we do in dealing with development.

They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I thank the Chairman for facilitating this meeting.  We are pleased to have an opportunity to engage with the joint committee.  Mr. Groves has given us some strict instructions to the effect that we should keep our opening remarks short.  We will do that.  I will make some introductory remarks about the centre and each of us will make a brief contribution to outline our specific areas of interest.  The Centre for Global Development was established on foot of the first strategic plan for UCC, which covered the period from 2008 to 2012.  The centre is explicitly recognised in the most recent strategic plan, which has just been published and covers the period from 2013 to 2017, as part of UCC's strategy for the next five years and beyond.  Over 110 academic and non-academic staff of the university are members of the Centre for Global Development.  They come from all four of UCC's colleges - arts and humanities, business and law, medicine and health, and science, engineering and food science.  I am the head of the last of those colleges.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the Centre for Global Development captures a wide range of activity that is already going on.  It holds within it the potential to generate new interactions and stimulate new perspectives.  As the Chairman mentioned, the core vision of the centre as set out in the strategic plan is to seek a \"global context\" for everything we do in UCC.  We are facing some of the challenges of the 21st century, including food production and distribution, health care, disease eradication, energy supply, climate change and environmental protection and the effects of technological change in developing countries.  We also have expertise in some of the areas that arise on the non-scientific side, including social integration, democratic governance, human rights and education.  We regard them as part of what we do.  All of our activity can be summarised in the phrase \"sustainable global development\".<\/p><p>  We have a particular focus on things that might not be at the front line of traditional international development.  Irish aid policy has a particular focus on the alleviation of hunger.  As we are concerned with the development of infrastructure in developing countries, we focus on areas like energy, transport and information and communications technology.  The development of sustainable societies depends on such things and on economic development.  We are working in the context of the Government's strategy of developing a range of further relationships with developing countries.  For that reason, we are very conscious of the Africa strategy.  We are integrated into the national agenda.  I am a member of the Irish Aid expert advisory group.  The UCC Centre for Global Development was integrally involved in providing a response to the review of the White Paper.  I understand that went to the Cabinet yesterday and will be published next week.  We are delighted with that.  I will not delay the committee further.  We look forward to engaging with the committee.  We would like that engagement to be as conversational as possible.  Each of my colleagues will say a brief word about their particular areas of interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810200,"counter":716,"content":"<p>We appreciate the opportunity to attend this meeting.  I will try to keep my contribution brief.  I am closely involved with Agridiet, which is a research project that started recently.  It is funded as part of the strategic partnership between Irish Aid and the higher education sector.  A consortium of eight universities, including UCD, some UK universities and four African universities, is looking at the links between small-scale farming and the nutritional status of women and children within farming households in Ethiopia and Tanzania.  This critical issue for international development was mentioned by President Higgins at the launch of a conference last week.  It was also mentioned by our Minister when he met the World Bank in Washington recently.  The links between nutrition and agriculture are really emerging as critical.  We are keen to be part of that.<\/p><p>  I would like to mention some of our teaching activities.  As the Chairman said, they lay the foundation for our other activities.  For example, we have an undergraduate programme in international development and food policy.  It is the only undergraduate programme of its sort in the country.  Many of those who work in non-governmental organisations, Irish Aid and other organisations have come through that programme.  A six-month overseas placement where our students spend six months with a development agency - often a national one or a non-governmental organisation with Irish links - is a key part of that.  These placements have been generously supported by Irish Aid over the years.  We think it is very important to sustain this programme.<\/p><p>  In the last five years, we have run a master's degree programme jointly with two Ethiopian universities.  It has been based in Ethiopia and funded by the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia and the World Bank.  On the strength of that emerging relationship with those universities, we have registered ten junior lecturers from Ethiopian universities for PhD study in UCC.  We expect to see those graduations from this year onwards.  We anticipate that we will offer a new, rather specialised, master's degree in food and nutrition security from next year.  It will be aimed very much as mid-level, mid-career specialists who work in this area internationally.  We consider that this area is under-served by academic courses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward Lahiff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810800,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly on our Supporting LIFE project, which is supported by the European Seventh Framework programme, FP7.  Supporting LIFE will start on Wednesday next, 1 May.  Its purpose is to accelerate and improve the diagnosis and treatment of children between the ages of two months and five years in northern Malawi.  One of the problems faced by Malawi, whose population is largely rural, is that many children live in isolated areas which may be number of hours' or possibly days' walk from a clinic or other facility providing medical intervention.  As a result, in cases of commonly treatable medical conditions such as pneumonia, malaria, meningitis and diarrhoea, it frequently occurs that by the time the child arrives at the clinic for treatment, he or she will have reached a late stage in the illness.  This makes it difficult if not impossible to treat the child and the result is an increase in child mortality.<\/p><p>  We propose to implement the World Health Organization's integrated management of childhood illness, IMCI, protocol as a mobile telephone app.  While the protocol is very good, it is paper-based and the document looks like a telephone directory.  Although often used in hospitals and clinics in Malawi, the IMCI protocol is cumbersome in paper form and is, therefore, ideally suited to be recoded as a mobile app.  Members may be surprised to learn that Malawi has a well-developed mobile telephone network and people who do not have shoes often have mobile telephones.  The mobile telephone network is growing rapidly on the basis of advanced technology.  Malawi already has 3.5G, 3.75G and 4G networks and all the other Gs are coming very quickly.  We want to exploit this technology and give the rural health surveillance attendants, who are government-trained, the ability to use the mobile phone app to rapidly diagnose conditions in children aged between two months and five years and get them to treatment quickly.  Another benefit of the initiative is that we can also ensure adherence to the WHO protocol and monitor outbreaks of disease in remote areas.  Under the current paper-based system, delays of between one and three months in disease reporting occur in rural parts of Malawi, which means that by the time the Ministry of Health hears about an outbreak, it is often too late to do anything practical.  We can also use the mobile apps as an educational aid for the health surveillance assistants.<\/p><p>  The project kicks off next week.  One of the issues we want to deal with is sustainability.  We have been fortunate to receive a small structural grant from University College Cork to build a physical research centre at the University of Mzuzu in northern Malawi.  We will use this centre as a base for the project and a mechanism for exploring other projects, including capacity-building in education in the university's nursing and midwifery and ICT departments.  We are working with the Malawian Ministry of Health to build up decision support systems to enhance its ability to formulate health policy and deal with disease outbreaks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Woodworth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810800,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank members for the invitation to appear before the joint committee.  A range of social science and education projects is documented in the Centre for Global Development annual report, which has been circulated to members.  I propose to focus on a teaching and teacher education project.  Funded by Irish Aid under the programme for strategic co-operation, the project is one of four research projects undertaken through a network of Irish colleges North and South of the Border, with headquarters at Mary Immaculate College.  The research development study involved four educational researchers from Irish universities working on capacity-building with eight colleagues from Kyambogo and Makerere universities, both of which are located in Kampala, Uganda, in the study of the teaching of mathematics and science in Ugandan secondary schools.  The study was undertaken between 2009 and 2011 and involved detailed case studies in 16 schools across four regions of Uganda - Fort Portal, Lira, Serotti and Kampala.  Its findings were disseminated to policy-makers in Uganda's national curriculum council and examination boards as well as teacher educators.<\/p><p>  The study is a good example of inter-institutional collaboration within Ireland, of which UCC was a part, and between universities in Ireland and Uganda, in which tangible support for universal secondary education was provided.  Significantly, Uganda introduced universal secondary education in 2006 and is a leader in this area in sub-Saharan Africa.  The day-to-day reality of double-shift teaching, with teachers working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., was very clear in our interviews with teachers and principals.  This broadening of policy priorities beyond universal primary education, UPE, represents a highly significant reorientation of the education system priorities in sub-Saharan Africa and one which merits sustained focus in the future in the context of development aid.  It may be a matter for us and Irish Aid to consider.  For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, 1 million teachers will be needed in the coming years to meet the demand for primary and post-primary teaching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Conway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366810800,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me an opportunity to address it today.  I am a paediatrician who specialises in newborn medicine.  For ten years, with my colleagues in Cork, including Dr. Sami Ahmed, who is from Sudan, we have made approximately ten visits to Sudan to teach newborn resuscitation at Ombdurman Maternity Hospital, the largest maternity hospital in Sudan.  We realised, however, that approximately 80% of deliveries in Sudan take place outside of hospitals - primarily in villages - and most deaths occur in the newborn period around the time of delivery.  As a result, we decided to introduce the Helping Babies Breathe programme, a new initiative from the American Academy of Pediatrics.<\/p><p>  I will describe how babies are born in Sudan and the changes that arose as a result of the new programme.  Selma is 16 years old and is having her first baby in a village of 100 houses.  Her midwife, Fatima, receives a call on her mobile phone informing her that Selma is about to deliver.  All of the midwives have mobile phones.  Fatima puts on her white sari.  She has a bucket of water which was boiled the previous night and an aluminium box containing equipment that has also been boiled.  She walks across the village and knows which house to enter because everyone in the village is gathered around it.  A birth is a festival in the village.  She enters the house to find Selma, her mother and the father's mother.  The midwife will sit on a stool, while the two other women will be on either side of Selma.  The midwife, who does not have gloves or a local anaesthetic, will wash her hands, make a large episiotomy and deliver the baby.  If the baby cries, there is a good chance it will live.  If it does not cry, she will hand it to a grandmother before delivering the placenta.  The grandmothers know the baby will die because it did not cry and the people outside will turn away from the house.  They will say, \"Selma is young and will have another baby next year.\"<\/p><p>  The next year, Fatima may come to Helping Babies Breathe, where we will teach her how to use the equipment, which I have brought with me.  Fatima must concentrate on giving the first minute of life to the baby and helping it breathe in the first minute.  If Selma becomes pregnant again the following year and the midwife returns to the village, she will have a plan.  She will wash her hands and prepare her bag and mask for delivery.  She will also prepare a clean area in the room in case the baby needs help.  When the baby is born she will place it on Selma's tummy and dry it vigorously to stimulate it.  If the baby is still not breathing, she will cut the cord, bring it to the clean area and keep it warm.  She will then suction out the baby's mouth, place the mask around its head and squeeze the mask, repeating the words \"Breathe, two, three.\"  She will then change the position of the mask, repeating the same words.  The baby should begin to move and cry.  If it starts to breathe within the first minute, it will survive, and Fatima will bring it to her mum.<\/p><p>  Helping Babies Breathe is based on a very simple concept that if a baby breathes within the first minute of birth, it will have a chance of survival.  We will change practices through this programme.  Last year, Irish Aid provided funding to enable us to purchase 1,000 bag masks and suction balls at a cost of approximately &euro;25 per training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Tony Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366811400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Ryan for a very detailed account of circumstances in Sudan.

We never want to take people away from their homes, train them and send them out into the world.  We do not work with the individual, we always work with institutions.  We might take a member of staff who has been trained up to PhD level and work with his home institution so he can go back there in future to work.

That is my thinking.  In some ways this is more about information and letting the committee know what can be achieved when people get together.

There has been a coming together of development workers and the international third level sector.  This has been supported in Ireland through the work of Irish Aid and the programme for strategic co-operation which is now in its third phase.  I refer to one project as an example.  The Irish-African partnership for research capacity-building was the first project involving all nine universities on the island of Ireland, both North and South.  The project looked at building research capacity in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda.  UCC was a partner in that project.  It included Irish universities from North and South working with universities in those four countries.  It was a very significant project for understanding the complexity of research capacity-building in very diverse national and university contexts.  For example, it involved interviewing 300 mainly senior and mid-level academics across the 13 to 14 universities involved in the project which helped significantly to understand the challenges of promoting that joined-up thinking.  Projects with Irish Aid funding can provide the context for colleagues across Irish universities to begin to understand development in new ways and also to consider how academics across universities may work together.  Professor Tony Ryan referred to the Esther network which provides support at the level of the individual institution, as does our centre for global development.  It is important to provide cross-institutional support by fostering the links across institutions, such as hospital to hospital or university to university.  This has been a very valuable global development in the past decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400007#F00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Conway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366812600,"counter":742,"content":"<p>It is always a challenge initially.  For example, a student from Tanzania had been accepted to undertake doctorate studies with us.  He was interviewed and his competence was beyond question.  His entire education from preschool had been through English.  Yet, he was held up by the Irish embassy in Tanzania over a certificate to show he had competency in English.  That is like asking you or me to produce a certificate showing we are competent in English.  Those are the little headaches.  Some students arrived last week from Ethiopia and they were confronted with the new &euro;300 charge when applying for a Garda identification document.  I do not know the technical term for the document.  That charge was not there before and it was a bit of a shock.  Those students are only staying in Ireland for a month.  These are the glitches which can arise but I do not think they are any worse than in any other country.<\/p><p>  On the question about networking, people in the development sector tend to be fairly switched on to wastage and opportunities and working across sectors.  For example, our AGRIDIET project involves UCD and UCC.  As Dr. Paul Conway said, Universities Ireland has been involved in bringing all the universities, North and South, into a common forum to discuss aid and particularly through the partnership with Irish Aid.  Four years ago, along with other academics I was involved in setting up a branch of the Development Studies Association which is a North-South body including virtually every institution in the country.

One of the reasons we engaged with two NGOs in Malawi is to ensure we could distribute the app.  The first NGO is Luke International Norway, which has experience with developing computer applications to manage anti-retroviral treatment clinics.  They have a very good patient registration system where people's thumb prints are scanned and they are given their anti-retroviral drugs.  They then return after a few weeks for further consultation.  The NGO has a considerable level of technical capability which is being developed all the time.  The second part is the social acceptance element of how that app gets to the health surveillance attendants and also how it becomes accepted by the patients.  The second NGO is Ungweru.  Professor Fitzpatrick has been heavily involved with this NGO since its founding.  The name of the NGO means, \"Light\".  This NGO is very good at social engagement and community work and building.  It has a budget as part of the project to work with local communities.  The app will be trialled in the clinics and in the rural areas.  The NGO will explain how the app works and how it will be used.  It is hoped this will encourage acceptance of the app.  The other element is technological.  Since we started talking about this project about 15 months ago, smart phones were costing about $200 each.  They are now half the price for a cheap android phone and the price will drop further.  The introduction of any technology is tricky because there needs to be an infrastructure to support it.  The other element is capacity-building in the universities so that eventually the ICT departments can take over ownership and maintenance of the software.  I am intrigued by the Deputy's comment about the husband and wife with the phone.  I will check that out because we really want the women to have the phones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Woodworth"},{"type":"speech","time":1366812600,"counter":745,"content":"<p>They may have mobile phones but the man was carrying it like it was a badge.

The author of that book, Malcolm Gladwell, mentions four different ways in which things happen.  I am of the view that these could be applied locally.  One of them is that one needs a small group of committed citizens in order to get something done.  In short, one needs a dedicated group.  I am sure that, as politicians, members are aware of the importance of small groups of committed people.  Connectors are also required.  We had a very strong connector with a local paediatrician from Sudan, who is really committed to making things better in his home country.  Knowledge makers are also needed.  For us, the knowledge makers were Sudanese doctors who returned to their country and decided to see if they could make a difference in introducing evidence-based practices in the largest maternity hospital there.  The fourth thing required was the &quot;stickiness factor&quot;.  This related to trying to keep things happening in Sudan and to keep the doctors there.  One reason which encouraged them to stay was the fact that they were recognised.  One of the ways in which they were given recognition was via the Irish health awards.  We brought them over to accept their award and when they returned home they were recognised for what they had done.  I was surprised by the difference the award made for them.<\/p><p>  The four aspects to which I refer really created sustainability for them.  In other words, they allowed them to carry on.

If I had known about the centre for global development at University College Cork when my daughter decided to do her primary degree there, I would not have been as sad about her leaving if I had known that she would be receiving an education of this quality.  Her primary degree was in food science and she has now moved on to look after children at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.<\/p><p>  This is an absolutely fascinating subject.  Some members, including the Chairman, have just returned from the conferences on hunger, nutrition and climate justice which was sponsored by Mary Robinson and the Government.  We interacted with everyone including people from the Masai to pastoralists to people from tiny villages in Nepal to individuals from Niger.  It was a fascinating event.  I congratulate University College Cork, in the first instance, and I also wish to congratulate Irish Aid.  I was not aware of the latter's centre or of the fact that it is working so diligently, professionally and in such an advanced manner behind the scenes in order to encourage the university to engage in so many of these programmes.<\/p><p>  The Chairman and other members have visited some of the Irish Aid programmes in Sierra Leone.  I refer, in particular, to the programme based on the concept of improving nutrition in the first 1,000 days from conception to the age of two.  We also witnessed the work taking place on the feeding programmes.  The conditions in which people in Sierra Leone live are terribly poor.  Hygiene is sadly lacking and there are huge numbers of young children.  In the context of what was discussed at the conference sponsored by Mary Robinson and the Government, how is duplication in the provision of development services dealt with?  We are all aware of the development studies centre at Kimmage Manor.  I do not know how many missionary agencies in this country run such facilities.  Does duplication occur in the context of educating people in this area?<\/p><p>  Professor Fitzpatrick referred to the Africa strategy.  The committee was very impressed by that strategy when it came before us for discussion.  Did our guests contribute to the strategy?  Do they follow its development?<\/p><p>  Deputy Mitchell referred to stunted growth.  As our guests are aware, the conference to which I refer dealt with the role of women, mainly in Africa but also in Mongolia and Nepal.  Apparently, many of the farmers in the various countries in these regions are women.  They need to be sustained by means of improving the quality of their land from the point of view of food production.  I presume our guests are expert in advising Irish Aid on or in operating in conjunction with it in respect of upgrading the quality land from the point of view of production.  A very strong message was put across at the conference to the effect that there is a need to listen to people.  It is clear that our guests listen to and educate those people.<\/p><p>  The millennium development goals are under review and they expire in 2015.

It is certainly positive to see Ireland, via third level university programmes and so on, becoming involved in such an imaginative way.  The degree of co-ordination is very impressive.  I want to recognise that in the first instance.  Professor Ryan referred to how important it was for the doctors to whom he referred to be recognised.  Our guests should also take their bows because they deserve to be recognised for what they have done.  Their work is very important.<\/p><p>  Our guests covered a wide range of matters.  I was particularly taken by Professor Ryan's wonderful and simple demonstration, which brought matters alive for all of us.  I have been a member of the committee since it was founded 20 years ago and I have never seen anyone use props in the way Professor Ryan did.  It was a splendid demonstration.  I am sure that in the future it might be overdone but as a beginning, this was really terrific.  There is another side to all of this, namely, the whole question of population.  This is something of a hobbyhorse of mine.  I am not for one second stating that the children involved should not be saved or that we should not invest massively in Africa, a continent to which Europe has done so much damage.  However, I am of the view that it is very important to track population trends and universities can do that.  No one is facing up to this matter.

I thank the Deputy and the Senator for their questions.  The question of the MDGs is critical.  While it is often right to focus down at village level and look at the detail - Irish Aid has a very good track record in doing that - we also need, as I am sure the members will appreciate, to focus on the big international issues.  Ireland has a role to play in the reformulation of the MDGs, the so-called post-2015 agenda.  That relates to issues not only of aid but also of global governance and trade.  Senator Norris spoke about the global population and the key words I would use in that respect are the sustainability agenda.  The sustainability agenda is absolutely central for the post-2015 agenda.  Academics and activists can play their part but we need governments to step up and show leadership.  Last week's conference was a critical marker in showing Ireland's seriousness about trying to set a global agenda, particularly around the two key linked issues of hunger and climate change.  Ireland has staked out a role for this and it should not hold back.  It should continue this not only on the hunger agenda but also on fairer trade regimes and the reform of international financial systems - those things which have a much greater impact on the lives of the poor than any particular feeding or health programme.  Those big global issues feature prominently in our teaching, but we would just encourage the Government to keep pushing in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward Lahiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1366813800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>It will be a hell of a challenge with a population of 9 billion, which has increased from 3 billion when I was an undergraduate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400009#H00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813800,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Population is something of a taboo issue.

He was one of the speakers we had last year, and we have planned others.  We work closely with D&oacute;chas, the umbrella body for NGOs in the development area.  We have also worked closely in the last year with Suas, whose agenda is to promote development education in the third level sector.  It has recently undertaken a national survey, which has been very informative.  One of the key findings from that survey - this would probably resonate with people - was that third level students have a great openness and willingness to engage with global development.  That is across the third level sector, but what they often struggle with is seeing how their personal actions will make a positive impact on global development.  There is an opportunity there with regard to their openness and willingness to engage, on the one hand, and on the other, their sense that it is not clear to them exactly how they can make an impact.  This represents an opportunity within the third level sector.  Part of our work in the Centre for Global Development, in collaboration with the four colleges and the various departments across them, is to support staff in working to foster that kind of global ethic in terms of what students get from a university education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400009#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Conway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366813800,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I would like to return to Deputy Eric Byrne's question on the Africa strategy.

That strategy is about developing a wider spectrum of relationships with developing countries, from aid to trade.  For example, in Zambia, Irish Aid has been doing similar work for the past 25 years even though, in the meantime, Zambia has become a middle-income country.  The seeking of different relationships with middle-income countries is something that the Africa strategy espouses, and we are very conscious of that.<\/p><p>  I return to the point we made that we consciously did not use the phrase \"centre for international development\" even though that was our working title for the first couple of years before we were formally launched.

For a long time the millennium goals in childhood looked at the major things for under-fives &ndash; gastroenteritis and immunisation - and the newborn was ignored.  After a number of years it became clear that one could not reach the objectives until one addressed what we call neonatal wastage &ndash; the massive number of deaths in the newborn period.  That is why the investment began into newborn wastage.  It is a terrible phrase but it represents the notion that, as I said earlier, Selma is young and she can have another baby next year.  That attitude puts Selma at great risk because she has a one in 18 chance of dying during her childbirth years.  Having more babies means more health complications.  She could get an obstructed birth.  She could get a fistula where her rectum will empty into her vagina and she will be isolated from her community - left out in the villages - and unless she is close to a city she will never get repaired. Her life could be over because of something like that.<\/p><p>  There is also the question of whether having more babies increases the world population.  It does not.  The reason she is having more babies is because she is poor.  People do not have more babies because of religious beliefs.  They have more babies because of poverty and because they do not know if their children will survive.  That is well established.  Saving babies in the newborn period does not increase the world population.  Also, saving babies well in the newborn period reduces damaged babies which is another reason for proper resuscitation of babies in the newborn period.

If the Government of Ethiopia is told that the only way out of poverty is to grow more export crops then the ones who will grow them are companies providing irrigation and infrastructure and the small, subsistence food producers who are looking after their own neck of the woods will be pushed to one side.  It is a huge question.  It is about how we conceive of development.  Do we see it as being the old-fashioned modernisation, top-down paradigm or do we see it as empowering local people and allowing, for example, the Government of Malawi to give subsidies on fertiliser to allow peasants to grow a little more maize to feed their families?  Or do we insist on a First World elimination of subsidies and the opening up of free trade, which leaves governments with limited options?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400010#J01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward Lahiff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366815000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Picking up on the points made by Dr. Lahiff about the land grab issue, that is illustrative of the way in which the Centre for Global Development can add value to our understanding of key issues.

The hospital we work with is the largest maternity hospital in the world where there are 35,000 deliveries a year, which is the total for the three maternity hospitals in Dublin and Cork University Hospital combined.  Most of the women in the hospital have been cut.  I met medical students, many of whom had been brought up in the United Kingdom where their fathers had been trained and I presume they had not been cut, but many of them were part of the advocacy groups which visited schools to try to discourage FGM.  They were advocating against it.  I met midwives and began to realise that the wives of many of the doctors to whom I had spoken had been cut, as had the midwives.  I felt it was a shameful topic for them to talk about and that it made them uncomfortable.  It was a deep cultural issue and not a comfortable one to raise.<\/p><p>  I also met a doctor who was probably the world expert in repairing the extraordinary damage done to some females, not only in making the initial cut but also episiotomy cuts and repairs subsequent to having babies.  I met the village midwives also who were paid to make the cuts when children were about six years of age and it was over and done with in about two or three minutes.  As to whether they could have been prevented, the only persons who could have prevented them were the men, but they were up against a strong female culture that drove the practice.  I am aware that legislation against the practice was introduced in most African countries, but that did not stop it taking place.

He is joined by Mr. Alan Glasgow, head of business development in GOAL.<\/p><p>  Members are well aware of the excellent history and work of GOAL in the alleviation of the suffering of the poor and the poorest.  For nearly four decades, GOAL has been to the forefront of the response to major humanitarian disasters in over 50 countries.  It is currently contributing to humanitarian relief in Syria, from where Mr. Andrews has just returned.  He was within a short distance of the conflict.  He will concentrate predominantly today on his visit to Syria because it is a very important subject.  There seems to be political deadlock regarding Syria and there appears to be no solution forthcoming in the shorter term.

As the Chairman pointed out, GOAL has been operating in some of the poorest parts of the world on behalf of some of the poorest people in the world since the late 1970s.  We are currently operating in 13 countries and employ almost 3,000 staff, most of whom are nationals of the countries in which we work.<\/p><p>  Today I will talk about our latest intervention, which is in Syria.  I very much welcome the opportunity.  As the Chairman said, I returned from Syria less than two weeks ago.  I had an opportunity to examine our operation there.  I will talk about that experience in the context of the conflict in general.<\/p><p>  I reviewed the transcripts of this committee from December, when representatives of <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF,<\/font> attended to speak about their experience in Syria.  I respect the committee's ongoing prioritisation of this subject.  It is worth pointing out that when the committee spoke to MSF, the death toll was 40,000.  Today, just four months later, it is almost 80,000.  In December, there were 1 million displaced individuals but the number has more than doubled since then.  All of the indicators suggest the conflict will get worse.  Last week, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said this is the worst humanitarian crisis since the Cold War.  These are very strong words.  After the Rwandan genocide, the United Nations tried to reflect on how it could ensure it would not happen again.  One method of answering the question was to develop a concept whereby it could reconcile the sovereignty of a state with the duty to protect that state's citizens in circumstances in which they are subjected to mass atrocities, human rights violations and, in some cases, chemical attacks.  The United Nations answered the question through its principle of the responsibility to protect.  The objective was to establish that the sovereignty of a state is a duty rather than a right.  Where a country fails to discharge its duty to protect its citizens from the kinds of attacks in question, it will engage the UN obligations, from which consequences flow.<\/p><p>  Two years since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, there is total paralysis in respect of the international community's response.  As such, the United Nations is in a position in which it cannot find its voice, with the consequence that people are suffering.  Since this committee last discussed the issue, a further 40,000 people have died.  In June, when harvests will be very much diminished, challenges will arise in regard to resources.  Those challenges will lead to further conflict, and the reality is that by some stage in the summer the death toll will have exceeded 100,000.  The words of Mr. Guterres may not be hyperbole and may be accurate.<\/p><p>  The US President, Mr. Barack Obama, has said the use of chemical weapons would be a red-line issue for the United States and that it would not turn a blind eye to their use.  However, as we have seen, the French and UK Governments and the brigadier general in Israel have said in the past 24 hours that they are satisfied that chemical weapons have been used in the Syrian conflict.  This makes us wonder whether any political solution to the conflict can be found.<\/p><p>  Let me concentrate on GOAL's intervention in Syria.  We decided we would operate inside Syria because we felt that those with the fewest resources are those who are least able to get out of the country.  In the context of post-conflict reconciliation, it is much better to try to help people who are already in the country to stay in the country.  Thus, we decided to intervene within the Syrian borders.  GOAL is the only Irish NGO inside Syria providing intervention for those affected by the conflict.<\/p><p>  GOAL began its intervention using its own resources by providing aid in the northern province of Idlib.  Subsequently, it partnered with Irish Aid and, more recently, the US Government through Food for Peace and OFTA.  We are scaling up our intervention and hope it will reach almost 250,000 people by the summer.  Having said that, we recognise the need is escalating beyond any measurements taken at the beginning of the year.<\/p><p>  Of the money pledged by donor governments at the beginning of the year, only 20% has been honoured.  I recognise that the international community, in failing to achieve unity of purpose and a unified platform, is hamstrung, but it should at least do what it said it would do.  It said it would honour the pledges and has not done so.  Every day, we hear from UN agents that they cannot do their work.  As recently as last week, Ms Valerie Amos, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, stated this is a humanitarian catastrophe.  One can have sympathy for the fact that the UN Security Council cannot achieve unity of purpose but one cannot have sympathy for the fact that the international community has failed to do what it said it would do.  Even if it honoured its commitments fully, it would have to recognise that needs have grown so much in recent months that its pledges would not be sufficient to meet them.<\/p><p>  I had the opportunity to visit Syria less than two weeks ago.  The objective of the visit was to assess our operational protocols and our security position and to visit the local staff.  All our staff in Syria are nationals of that country.  Many of them have been very badly affected in that they have lost loved ones, property or their livelihood.  They conveyed to me the urgency of the situation and pleaded with me to advocate here and wherever I could find a forum for a greater sense of urgency, more attention and intolerance for the inertia that has characterised the response to the conflict over the past few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366816200,"counter":797,"content":"<p>When Mr. Andrews visited Syria, what did he see at first hand inside the country's borders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400013#M00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366816200,"counter":798,"content":"<p>The area that I visited was in northern Idlib and was a relatively safe part of northern Syria.

Of the 6.8 million people in need, Mr. Andrews mentioned that more than 50% are children.  I read the Save the Children charity's report which graphically outlined the wholesale maiming, torture and murdering of children.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Andrews said, we raised this matter no later than last Wednesday when the T&aacute;naiste was here to present a report on meetings of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  We highlighted the need for this matter to be raised at every opportunity by the Government and the T&aacute;naiste told us he has been doing so.

It is important for politicians to remain engaged but part of the difficulty is that the only information we are getting is from the media.  Very little information is coming back to Ireland on what is happening.<\/p><p>  Mr. Andrews referred to the use of chemical weapons.  According to some media reports, it is alleged that chemical weapons are being used by the Free Syrian Army in Allepo.  On Thursday, the FSA representative was asked about what was going on in the liberated area, and whether women were being forced to wear the chador or veil.  Such reports are emanating from Aleppo.  People also asked about the Free Syrian Army itself.  On 11 April, <i>Le Monde <\/i>had a leading article on the make-up of the Free Syrian Army.<\/p> <p>It said the main, experienced fighters who make up the bulk of the forces is Jabhat al-Nusra which is linked to al-Qaeda.

In referring to \"commonality of purpose\", what is it they want the Government to do?  Do they want the arms embargo to be lifted?  Do they think the introduction of more weapons will help?  A question that was put on Thursday was whether there was a pipeline of weapons from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  The representative said there was not.  According to the media, there are weapons going in from all sides, which is a difficulty, but more weapons will not resolve matters.  I spoke to religious people earlier in the year who said they were looking for a third way, which it seems is not going to happen.  They said many of the fighters were foreign not local.  That is the difficulty.  During the Iraq war, 1 million Iraqi people went to Syria.  There are hundreds of thousands of Palestinians there.  All of that is in the mix.  What can we do aside from keeping ourselves abreast of events?  What would a common position on lifting the arms embargo achieve?  How would it make GOAL's job any easier?  There was an allegation that aid was only going through government sources, but if one speaks to private aid groups, it is clear that aid is going to the liberated areas.  People will not say that publicly.  A representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs said adamantly that sides were not being taken but the aid was going through official channels such as the UN.

Accordingly, aid is channelled through and respects the sovereignty of the member state and, as such, relies on it to ensure aid is distributed evenly among all of those affected by the conflict who have humanitarian needs.  Naturally, there are many who have reasonably concluded that the Syrian government is not minded to distribute the aid evenly.  GOAL operates in an area which is controlled by the Free Syrian Army and we provide a balance with other NGOs working on that side within the country.  While Irish Government aid goes through one side, there is a humanitarian need on both sides.  We do not take a position as to whose humanitarian need is greater.

The clich&eacute; is that \"truth is the first casualty of war\", which raises the question of what we can rely on.  One hears propaganda from both sides.  Naturally, the spectre of al-Qaeda is raised by one side while allegations of atrocities are made by the Free Syrian Army.  Atrocities are being committed by both sides.  The media might not be very good at attending to these issues.

They could raise it constantly.  It is not a question of exploring the difficult issue of sovereignty and the duty to protect it; it is simply a question of keeping promises and showing solidarity for citizens who are being hammered by this war.<\/p><p>  It is not an intractable problem either.  There are people who dismiss Syria.  It does not engage the public, which dismisses it as being an issue in a hopelessly violent part of the world which sits on a tectonic plate of conflict where there are many competing interests.  Russia, China and Iran appear to be on one side with Israel on another.  That does not make it completely intractable.  The North of Ireland was dismissed as a problem which could not be solved at one time.  Being unable to do everything is not an excuse to do nothing.  There are things which can be done.  As a humanitarian agency, GOAL wants simply to get safe access to deliver our aid, capacity, competence and experience to this area.  To reply to Deputy O'Sullivan, aid is not getting to where it is needed.  The UN is pulling its hair out.  Valerie Amos is saying this is the worst humanitarian catastrophe in a long time.

I remember him coming to the Seanad when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and reporting with absolute passion and moral outrage about the situation in East Timor.  Some of that was clear in the delegation's report and what Mr. Andrews said today.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, human rights are blown off the agenda by the financial situation.  I may have been wrong about saying that we might not get reported because when I turned around, I noticed a very professional looking young woman with a notepad and pencil.

It was always the finance committee.  <\/p><p>  I have asked this question of other representatives in other situations.  It is morally appalling that people step up to the camera with pledges and then do not follow through on them.  Could we have a list of the donor defaulters and then this committee could write to their embassies for an update?  We cannot tell them they must give the money but we could ask for an update on their position regarding this because we are interested in the situation in Syria.  That might encourage them a bit.  It is not much but it is perhaps all we can do.  I am not even sure if that is possible.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Andrews said that people enter this conflict as moderates and come out as radicals.  That is completely understandable and would probably happen to me if I saw the kind of things Mr. Andrews described in his report such as mosques attacked by government forces when people were at prayer and a man with his dead child in his arms.  This is shocking stuff.  What will we be confronted with after the endgame?  What kind of regime will take over?  The Assad regime is appalling, as was that of Saddam Hussein.  What came after was infinitely worse.  Does Mr. Andrews have any views on that?  Is there anything positive in the endgame?  How can we help without further radicalising and interfering in internal affairs because we would all like to see a decent government replacing what is there.  The awful prospect is that it might be even more oppressive but oppressive in a different way.  That is why people are hesitant, perhaps foolishly, to intervene.  My view is that they should have gone in with a big stick at the beginning and whacked it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400015#O00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1366817400,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Andrews and Mr. Glasgow.

The Lebanese delegation pointed out that the numbers arriving in Tripoli and northern Lebanon were the equivalent of 9 million refugees arriving in France or 22 million arriving into the United States.  Everyone is aware of the figures but when they are put in those terms they give pause for thought.  The situation in neighbouring countries is also catastrophic but we commend the UNHCR, with support by Irish Aid, on its efforts to provide support for these refugees.  When we assessed the refugee situation in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey in September last year, the situation was difficult but it was by no means overwhelming.  This prompted us to examine our strategy of intervening internally in order to keep Syrians as close to their homes as possible rather than crossing the border.  The reason for this strategy was twofold.  First, GOAL always attempts to be as close to the problem as possible and, second, the situation was not as overwhelming as it has since become.  The numbers of refugees in neighbouring countries are becoming very worrying.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked a follow up question on how GOAL decides who gets aid.  Over many years GOAL has developed a set of targeting methodologies for the selection of beneficiaries once we make a decision to intervene in a country.  We work through relief committees, which are the community structures for assisting people on the ground.  We begin by establishing that nothing we are doing will make the situation worse and that our conflict assessment has been appropriate.  Using the relief committees, we identify further the most vulnerable within communities.  In respect of the aid we are providing in northern Idlib, we have asked the relief committees to identify widows, orphans, the disabled and the infirm.  By means of finely tuned monitoring and evaluation systems developed over the years, we are able to ensure our targeting is correct.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne also asked about the food for peace programme, which is an unusual name.  Food for peace is an instrument developed by the department of humanitarian and conflict affairs in USAID, which is the US equivalent of Irish Aid, to fund programme activity in conflict zones and places that are emerging from conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400016#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Glasgow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366818000,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Many of the questions related to the tension between respecting the sovereignty of Syria while also providing for the humanitarian protection of citizens and the international community's ability to reconcile those competing interests.

We see clearly that while the UN has set itself a target of reconciling that problem it appears from what has happened subsequently that, for example, responsibility to protect is not an effective instrument because the principles on which it is based cannot be discharged in these circumstances.  Effectively, the UN is paralysed and cannot meet the major humanitarian needs that are emerging.

My original objection to the motion was based on what I considered its unparliamentary approach.  The approach would be fine in the case of a person on trial but it was not appropriate to Parliament.  I note the difference between Parliament and the Executive.  The point I raised at the very beginning was that the approach to the issue was unparliamentary.  Whatever the atrocity, if we purport to achieve a result of benefit to the people who were offended, then we should do so in the best tradition of parliamentary democracy.  The points raised are totally outside of our influence in most cases.  I also received a telephone call from Mr. Browder, in which it was brought to my attention that other jurisdictions had made legislative changes.  I fully respect that it is the right of any jurisdiction to make changes, but it does not necessarily follow that we as an independent national entity follow it.  We are an independent Parliament.  The fact the European Parliament has come to a particular conclusion does not necessarily mean that we must follow it either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400018#R00900","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366819800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I have difficulty with two aspects of the Deputy's amendment.

I do not think it is that \"mysterious\".  Maybe the word \"undisclosed\" needs to be clarified.

I take Deputy Crowe's point about the posthumous prosecution.  It is implied in the amendment that the associated activities in relation to the particular issue should be fully disclosed and examined and that a report should be provided.  As I was not there, I do not know the full circumstances.  My knowledge is based on what I have read and on what the European Parliament has said and discussed.

It was commensurate with it.  The motion was circulated to all members of the committee.  Some members asked for it to be amended and that was done.  I remind Deputy Durkan of a private conversation I had with him.  I will not disclose the details of it.  I ask him to reflect on that conversation in the context of what he said about the letter from the Russian ambassador.<\/p><p>  I am not wedded to the wording of my motion.  It strikes me that this is a real test for this committee, as a number of members have said.  Human rights issues form part of our remit and responsibility.  Despite what Deputy Durkan has said, there is a world of difference between his amendment's call on the Government to &quot;liaise&quot; with and seek &quot;reassurance&quot; from Russia and the specific action that is required.  My motion, which notes &quot;the passage [of the] Magnitsky Law&quot; and refers to the European Parliament, etc., calls on the Government:<blockquote>to impose an Irish Magnitsky Law which would:<blockquote>- publicly list the names,<br \/>- deny visas into Ireland, and<br \/>- freeze any assets found in Ireland,<\/blockquote>of Russian government officials and others who:<blockquote>- were responsible for the false arrest, torture and death of Mr. Sergei Magnitsky,<br \/>- perpetrated or financially benefited from the crimes ... or<br \/>- participated in the cover up.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>If we make such a recommendation and the Government acts on it, the barriers and boundaries of the legal framework that would be put in place would have to be met in an evidence-based manner before action could be taken.  That is the protection.  Innocent people in Russia would not subscribe to this.  If others want to look at amending my motion, I will have no difficulty with that.  I appeal to all members to come up with something.  I would rather do this by means of consensus.  If the committee wants to pursue Deputy Durkan's proposal, which I regard as fairly anaemic, I will call a vote on it because, as Deputy Eric Byrne suggested, it would be a betrayal of our responsibility as members of this committee to uphold human rights values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400019#S00400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1366819800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Does any other member wish to comment before I proceed with the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013042400019#S00500","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1366819800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>It would be a pity if we were to divide on this issue.

I hope there is room to strengthen Deputy Durkan's amendment a little.  There are things in the original motion that would be difficult to do.  For example, it would be difficult to \"publicly list the names\" or to \"deny visas\" to people without having the full facts, or without being on a really solid footing with regard to all the allegations that have been made.  I am concerned about the adoption issue.  Many thousands of orphans in Russian orphanages are waiting to be adopted.  Many Irish families are anxious to see the bilateral agreement between Ireland and Russia completed.  At the back of our minds, we have to be conscious of that as well.

This has now happened and I acknowledge the support of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and our staff at the UN.  I had a meeting with Ambassador Anne Anderson, Ireland's ambassador to the UN, and her officials who were directly involved in the discussions and negotiations.

Approximately 23 or 24 countries abstained from the vote and three countries voted against it, Syria, North Korea and Iran.  I have raised the issue of Iran's vote against it with the Iranian ambassador.  It is significant that only those three countries voted against it.  However, there are issues in that some countries, such as China and Russia, which are significant arms exporters, abstained.  On 3 June 2013, the treaty will be open for ratification at the UN and it is intended Ireland will be one of the first signatories to it.  Over 50 signatories must be obtained before the treaty comes into effect.

I will also outline the progress to date in implementing the response to its findings and recommendations.  As the committee is aware, the VFM review of the RDF formally commenced in February 2010 and was conducted during a period of significant uncertainty and change.  The previous Government's national recovery plan, NRP, and the current Government's comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE were both key priorities over the course of the intervening period.  These priorities drew analytical resources away from the VFM review.  In advance of Government decisions relating to the CRE, any recommendations from the VFM review regarding the reserve could have been superseded by changes in the available resource envelope.  In this context, the review timeframe was unavoidably extended.<\/p><p>  The CRE and the associated reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, within a two brigade structure, defined for the steering committee the level of resourcing available for the reserve.  This included the number of PDF personnel that would be available to support the reserve on a full-time basis.  This allowed the steering committee to frame appropriate recommendations for the reserve that were financially viable and sustainable within the prevailing resource envelope, and that dovetailed with the broader reorganisation of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The VFM report was finalised by the steering committee and submitted to me in early October 2012.  It was subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published on the Department of Defence website in November 2012.  The report sets out a systematic and detailed analysis of the Reserve Defence Force.  The Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan previously set out an ambitious programme of reform for the reserve, which included a major reorganisation in 2005.  The VFM review found that the strength and associated training targets set out in that plan were not achieved over the intervening period.  This raised concerns about the capacity of the reserve.  Although I have no doubt that different people will hold different views as to why the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan did not achieve its desired objectives, there can be no doubt that it did not.<\/p><p>  I am a firm believer in revisiting plans that have not yielded the desired results.  Simply maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i> with the reserve and continuing in the hope of improvement at some point in the future was not a realistic option.  The value for money review clearly set out the key issues that must be addressed and although there are many detailed findings within the review, I will outline a brief summary of the key findings and recommendations.<\/p><p>  The cost of maintaining the reserve, including the costs of PDF support staff, ranged from &euro;34 million in 2006 to &euro;23.4 million in 2011, having peaked at just under &euro;36 million in 2008.  The majority of these costs - or an average 82% - were comprised of PDF support staff costs and the cost of paid training and gratuities for members of the reserve.  The effective strength of the Army reserve and Naval Service reserve at end 2011 was less than half of the organisational design strength of 9,692 personnel.  The number of full time PDF staff in place supporting these RDF structures was inefficient having regard to the actual strength level of the reserve.  The option of recruiting to the establishment level was not realistic given the level of resourcing available for paid training and having regard to previous recruitment trends.  In this context, the steering committee concluded that the existing organisational structure was inefficient and unsustainable.<\/p><p>  In addition, the reorganisation of the PDF within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel required the number of full-time Army PDF support staff for the Army reserve to be capped at 48 personnel, or 24 for each of the two new brigades.  There are a further nine PDF support staff for the Naval Service reserve, giving a total of 57 full-time PDF support personnel.  An examination of the number of reservists that undertook both paid and unpaid training highlighted that over the period of the review only approximately 60% of reservists undertook any paid training.  Research also identified that those reservists not undertaking paid training did not compensate for this with additional unpaid training.  In 2011, the number of reservists that met prescribed levels of paid and unpaid training for payment of a gratuity numbered 2,010, excluding recruits, of a reported effective strength of 4,554 personnel.<\/p><p>  There is a critical link between the uptake of training and the capacity of the reserve.  In this content, the steering committee had concerns about the capacity of the organisation to fulfil its role.  I particularly draw the attention of members to the numbers who undertook training.  The steering committee noted that the PDF could fulfil all ongoing operational requirements and that there were no operational gaps that required the ongoing deployment of the reserve at home or overseas.  In this context, it was concluded there was no requirement to amend the roles of the reserve beyond the contingent role currently provided for.  However, it was recommended that there was scope to achieve greater utility from the reserve through usage in a voluntary unpaid capacity for unarmed aid to the civil authority and other specified tasks.<\/p><p>  The steering committee considered a range of options for the reserve, including &quot;do-nothing&quot; or &quot;abolish&quot; options.  It concluded that it remained prudent that the State should have additional military resources available to provide additional support to the PDF if required.  This additional capacity could assist in dealing with a broad range of contingencies.  However, in light of concerns regarding the capacity of the reserve, there were caveats.<\/p><p>  The steering committee only recommended the retention of the reserve on the conditional basis that it be reformed and reorganised.  It also recommended that greater utility should be derived from the reserve in a voluntary unpaid capacity.  I accepted the findings and recommendations of the steering committee outlined in the report.  This included a recommended strength for the reserve of approximately 4,000 personnel, based both in PDF installations and in 16 other locations throughout the country.  This strength level was only sustainable, within existing resources, if gratuities were withdrawn from members of the reserve and this budget redirected to boost the availability of paid training.  As Minister, I emphasise the importance of participation in paid training as opposed to simple membership of the reserve.<\/p><p>  Detailed reorganisation proposals, including the location of the reserve units in the 16 locations outside of PDF installations, were brought forward by the chief of staff and Secretary General of my Department.  I accepted these proposals and the details of the reorganisation were published at the same time as the VFM review.  The reorganisation would consolidate a large number of under-strength Army reserve units that were previously organised into a three brigade structure into a smaller number of full-strength units within the new two brigade structure.  The new organisational structures set a revised strength ceiling for the Reserve of 4,069 personnel, 3,869 for the Army reserve and 200 for the Naval Service reserve.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the reorganisation commenced immediately under the auspices of a high-level implementation group chaired by the deputy chief of staff support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400003#B00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366792800,"counter":881,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The terms of reference provided for the outline defence policy and strategy and the associated development plan for the RDF.  That was in the public interest in the context of looking at the role of the RDF in current defence policy and strategy.  It was something of public interest and important, and something to ensure that the training, for example, that the RDF gets is truly of relevance, is in the public interest and is not based on an outdated strategy that has no application in 2013, 2014, 2015.<\/p><p>  Second, the committee was asked to identify the inputs, that is, the level and trend of costs and staffing resources associated with the RDF, including PDF and Department of Defence staffing resources.

Dealing with the wider public interest, what was identified in the context of the report was that a substantial sum of money was being spent on the reserve by way of the payment of gratuities to members who do not participate in training, and that clearly was a feature for the entire period that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was in office.  We wanted to ensure in the public interest that those members of the reserve who were in receipt of public moneys participated in training and had the capacity to provide assistance to the PDF should it be required if an issue arose.  Clearly, that was in the public interest.<\/p><p>  The committee next had to identify the level and trend of training activity and the outputs associated with the RDF.  In the context of outputs, an issue I mentioned earlier, we have, for example, the Civil Defence which, when there is an emergency of different descriptions, and usually climate related, on a volunteer basis provides substantial assistance, and does so at no cost to the State.  The State has been for some time in the midst of a fiscal difficulty of which the Deputy will be familiar and one of the issues was what contribution the RDF can make, and in circumstances where, if its members are asked to undertake duties for which they have undertaken training, it results in a cost to the Exchequer.  There are circumstances in which the Civil Defence is currently utilised in which the RDF could be utilised, either jointly or separately from the Civil Defence.  There was clearly an issue - the report addresses it - as to circumstances in which, in a volunteer capacity, the RDF could be engaged as support for the PDF or in assistance to the civil power.  It is clearly in the public interest that such matters be clarified and addressed and, if I could say so, it is in the interests of members of the RDF.<\/p><p>  Since becoming Minister, I have spoken to many members of the RDF.  One of their frustrations, which I understand and with which I identify, is that they participate in training but they feel they are not utilised and there are opportunities when they could have been utilised.  In a time of austerity when the State must be careful with how it spends public money, where there is Civil Defence personnel trained to engage in something that it could do with equal efficiency to the RDF, even where the RDF has the training, the Civil Defence is engaged in practical terms because it does not result in expense to the State.  That is unfair to members of the RDF, all of whom are volunteers who receive little money for participating individually in the RDF, who have a commitment and who would welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  It is in their interest and the public interest they be afforded the opportunity to do so.<\/p><p>  The review committee next had to examine the extent to which the plan's objectives have been achieved.  These plans, which were in place during the lifetime of the previous Government and which we inherited when we came into office, were clearly dysfunctional and not working.  It was in the public interest and in the interest of members of the RDF that such be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400005#D04600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1366793400,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Could I interrupt the Minister for a moment?

The level of reservists who did not participate in training could not be sustained and had to be addressed.  There is no question about this.  A member of the Reserve Defence Force, as a support to the Permanent Defence Force, should train on a regular basis, as should members of Civil Defence and others who support the front line.  There is no question about this issue.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt the Minister will agree with what I am about to say.  The civic pride and sense of patriotism which civilians have in being able to participate in the Reserve Defence Force is not just about the training, ceremony and marching on St. Patrick's day.  It is about being involved in the community and teaching young men and women a sense of place and identity.  It is a powerful experience for anybody who has been through it.  I have met a significant number of reservists who had concerns prior to the publication of the value for money report and what followed.<\/p><p>  I have submitted parliamentary questions and engaged with the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on this matter.  If one reads the parliamentary questions it is clear the budgetary allocation for the Reserve Defence Force year on year had been reduced over a number of years.  It is not acceptable somebody in the Reserve Defence Force was not participating in training on a regular basis, but rather than removing people who are not participating in training we could have had enhancements.  The Minister has set a ceiling of 4,000.  Later this afternoon the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association will present its response to the committee.  Will the Minister read the transcript of what the witnesses have to say and see whether any issues they raise could be addressed retrospectively?  It is important when we deal with the legitimate systematic issues raised by the report that we also see the immense value of citizens having an opportunity to be part of this.<\/p><p>  Two fantastic young women reservists in Carndonagh in Donegal told me that up to 100 young people in the local school expressed an interest in being part of the Reserve Defence Force.  The difficulty is that the base there will be centralised in central Donegal and they will not have the same support from cadres.  Will the Minister reflect on whether we can encourage a new generation of young people to be part of this and understand that with this responsibility comes regular training, because one is a real support to the Permanent Defence Force?<\/p><p>  I apologise for taking so long to ask my question, but the Minister takes a fair long time to respond to questions so I am sure he will return the favour.  The Minister should address the issues which need to be addressed, but a number of young people throughout the State would like to be a part of the Reserve Defence Force.  It will be grand to have a new, leaner and fitter Reserve Defence Force but will the Minister consider the ceiling and review it regularly and throw out the net to see what interest exists and how as many young people as possible can be allowed to be involved and part of this?  It is a very proud tradition and I would not like people to have a sense we are winding it down.  This is the impression given by the budget allocation.  There is pride among the people who have served.  Moving forward we can make it leaner, fitter and fresher but we need to keep the net open for people to get involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400006#E00700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794000,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I would disagree with absolutely nothing Deputy Mac Lochlainn has said.  The commitment to volunteerism and engagement, and the interest of members of the Reserve Defence Force, is very commendable and should be encouraged.  I very much encourage young people, within the limited numbers for which we can provide at present, to engage with the Reserve Defence Force.  With regard to those who are members and, if I can put it this way, who have an emotional attachment to the Reserve Defence Force but who have long since passed engaging in training and are not training, it is important that we have a turnover of people with young people coming in.  I do not want it to be suggested that I am encouraging any particular individual not to engage, but what the Deputy stated is right.  It is important we encourage young people to join the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p><p>  We must be conscious that we have a numbers issue.  Reserve Defence Force numbers are approximately 50% of the numbers in the Army and Naval Service in the Permanent Defence Force, so there is a connection with regard to where the number should be.  People should be encouraged, but we must operate in the financial parameters which exist at present, and there are no mechanisms for increasing public expenditure.<\/p><p>  As the Minister for Defence I have had to do battle to ensure we have the resources we need.  Resources were assigned to the Permanent Defence Force prior to my coming to office, and when I examined where we were going for the next two or three years I saw that the numbers in the Permanent Defence Force could have fallen below 8,000 because of the original deals done with the troika and what was being assigned to the Department of Defence.  At an early stage I moved to get a Government decision to ensure we maintained numbers at 9,500 and did not drop below a figure which would render it impossible for the Permanent Defence Force to perform its civil function and continue to engage in UN peacekeeping operations, which is a very important element of what we do internationally.<\/p><p>  I will keep this under review.  I hope that as a result of the changes effected the vast majority of the Reserve Defence Force will take up training days.  We will keep an eye on how things are going.

Consequently, the financial focus has gone from the payment of the gratuity to the payment for training days, which is particularly important.

It has been used by past governments for value-for-money reviews and anyone who has read the report would see there was a clear focus on public interest, on the interaction between the PDF and the RDF and on how the RDF can be made more relevant in today's world.  This was the focus in the totality of the report in the context of the different options that were considered and the ultimate recommendations made.  It was a very well-written report that sets out clearly the reasoning behind the decisions recommended.  I thank Senator Conway for his comments.

One important aspect on which I touched in my opening statement but which members have not touched on in any question thus far is that for quite a number of the RDF's members, training will take place within existing PDF barracks.  This is an important increase in the connectivity between the PDF and the RDF, rather than there simply being a PDF cadre and the RDF being what effectively was a separate entity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400007#F01600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I welcome that and believe the single force concept is the option to take because the RDF must be far more professional.  This leads to the question of members of the RDF eventually serving overseas, which has been spoken about for a long time.  In a situation in which both groups were being trained together and the RDF was to reach the same level of competence and professionalism as the PDF, is there any intention or has thought been given to the possibility of members of the RDF serving overseas in the Lebanon or elsewhere?

In dealing with overseas duties, it is important that members of the Defence Forces are trained to the maximum possible extent and at present, it is certainly not envisaged that members of the RDF would go overseas.  In the context of overseas duties, there are limited opportunities for members of the PDF to engage in overseas duties.  I will not go through the litany of numbers but as the joint committee is aware, approximately 450 members of the PDF are serving in various different locations at present, with the largest contingent of course being in the Lebanon.  In the context of the joint operations in Lebanon between ourselves and the Finns, the PDF contingent numbers will reduce next November and there will be an issue to identify other United Nations missions to which we may constructively contribute in order that members of the PDF can realise their objectives and ambitions of being able to use in a beneficial way the substantial training they receive.  Consequently, it is not envisaged at present that members of the RDF would be engaged in overseas missions.  There would be an issue as to the level of training required and even with participating in the training days that now are prescribed, there would be a concern as to their safety, as well as their capacity to engage in such missions.  This does not mean that at some stage in the future, in different circumstances, this may not prove possible but I do not wish to hold out the possibility of something now that is not likely to be fulfilled or to give people unreal expectations based on the level of training available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400007#F01800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1366795200,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The implementation plan will achieve that.  It may well arise out of that, that there will be circumstances in which members of the RDF will in the future be utilised when in the past they have not been.  I deliberately touched on that both in my speech and in some of the responses to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v before his rather hasty departure.<\/p><p>  There are areas of activity in which the Civil Defence engages on occasions when there are emergencies.  In circumstances where the appropriate training has been provided to members of the reserve and an emergency arises if assistance is required, in circumstances where there is not a cost to the State from members of the reserve providing assistance, that will open up opportunities.  Those are issues for further reflection as we implement the process.

Deputy Stanton will be familiar with the situation from his time in the reserve.  There is a feeling that despite the training they are not adequately utilised.  In examining the situation I would be very happy to hear the reflections of members of the reserve.  They are contributing further to the process of change.  They might well identify practical circumstances in which they believe the reserve should be engaged.  In the past, comments of that nature were made.  By the change we have effected and by focusing finance on training days, from a Government perspective the financial burden of the reserve being engaged in issues on which they have not been requested to engage in the past is lifted from the Government.  I am sorry to put it in that basic way but it is clear that this did impact on the fact that the reserve was not used in the past.  It might not have been articulated by my predecessors but it is the truth.  Now the circumstances have changed and I would be interested, following the meeting with members of the reserve this afternoon, if this is an issue on which they reflect, to see what they have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400008#G00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1366795200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>As a committee we visited the emergency preparation room in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Patrick Mulley, vice president of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, Mr. Gerard Kiely, president of RDFRA, Mr. Rob Gilbey, a member of the Army Reserve, Mr. Eoin Colgan, a member of the Naval Service Reserve, and Mr. Shane Morris, a member of the Naval Service Reserve.<\/p><p>  The objective of our presentation today is to seek to change the mindset in respect of how the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, is utilised and to request that the joint committee commission an independent review and report on the RDF with a view to identifying the real value for money associated with a reserve force and how this can be utilised in the Irish defence capability framework.<\/p><p>  I think it beneficial to give the committee a little information about the RDF.  The RDF is the reserve component of Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces.  Its roles are the same as those assigned to the Permanent Defence Force.  However, the RDF&rsquo;s most important contribution is to support the Permanent Defence Force in its contingency defence roles and other crisis situations.  Therefore, in peacetime, the main function of the RDF is to train and prepare for these contingency roles.<\/p><p>  The RDF comprises the First Line Reserve, the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve.  The First Line Reserve comprises former members of the Permanent Defence Force who have a contractual obligation and commitment to the First Line Reserve.  For the purposes of today&rsquo;s presentation, we are concerned only with the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve.  These are made up of volunteers who undertake military activities in their spare time.  These volunteers come from all walks of life within Ireland and they freely volunteer most of their reserve service.  They do so in addition to work, study or family commitments and offer a wealth of civilian qualifications and experience that could be used by the State.<\/p><p>  The current establishment of the RDF is 4,069 volunteers, comprising 3,869 personnel in the Army Reserve and 200 personnel in the Naval Service Reserve.  However, the figure is slightly higher now as a result of numerous personnel serving without appointments resulting from the recent reorganisation of the RDF.  The Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, is the representative body that represents the interests of members of the RDF within certain defined parameters.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Defence has already addressed the committee this morning regarding the value for money, VFM, review of the RDF.  The RDFRA believes there are major issues with the VFM review and objects to its conclusions and the consequences that have come about as a result.  It is not our intention to address the VFM review in any detail today.  It is too late to do so given that the Minister has already made his decisions based on its findings and the reorganisation of the RDF is already well under way.  However, we would like to make some general comments on the VFM review before moving on.  It is our opinion that the VFM review is flawed on a number of levels.  It failed to make any qualitative evaluation of the input of the Permanent Defence Force into the RDF.  It sets up biased comparisons in its case studies.  It misinterprets evidence and includes no substantial analysis to support many of its claims.  In addition, it completely ignores the operational capability, experience and outputs of the Naval Service Reserve.<\/p><p>  It is unfortunate that there was no member of the RDFRA or the RDF on the steering committee and it appears that the VFM review has been prepared with a certain bias in its approach and findings.  We find it disappointing that a true opportunity has been missed to conduct a critical review of the RDF with a view to identifying how this valuable resource can be effectively used for the benefit of the State.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the VFM review and the latest reorganisation of the RDF run contrary to international trends, existing studies and reports on international comparators and previous studies on the RDF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400009#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366796100,"counter":984,"content":"<p>We would be interested in engaging with the association if it has other suggestions at a not-too-far-away date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400010#BB00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1366796100,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I am supportive in general of what Mr. Cooney has said and the presentation that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400010#BB00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366796700,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Who wants to take those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400011#CC00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366796700,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I might address them in the first instance and invite some of my colleagues to come in.  I thank the Deputy for his kind words.  We would disagree with the Minister in relation to the survival of the Reserve.  The framework that has been put in place as part of the reorganisation completely disregards the fact that we have lives outside of the Defence Forces and that the KPIs and the conditions of service that are put upon us are particularly onerous.  They will be very difficult for reservists to meet to be effective.  Essentially the value for money review has stated that it will come back and look at this in three years' time.  It has been established in such a way that it will be so difficult for us to meet those KPIs that at the end of three years they will turn around and say, \"they could not do it.\"  Is it going to be a case that we could not do it because the Government did not help us, it did not put in the support and it did not engage with us in the first place in respect of getting our input before imposing those restrictions on us?<\/p><p>  On the issue of the protection of employment, to a large extent we rely on the goodwill of employers.  If one's statutory entitlement to annual leave is 20 days and one is expected to do 14 days full-time training, one has essentially lost half of one's annual leave.  Now reservists have given up either half of their annual leave or try to take unpaid leave.  That puts one at a significant disadvantage in respect of where one is with one's family life and if one is self-employed one cannot take that time off.  It is submitted that could be addressed quite easily with legislation or through employment legislation such as the Employment Equality Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act.  These could be amended to include provisions for reservists and provisions preventing discrimination against reservists and protection of reservists.  I invite Mr. Robert Gilbey who has looked at the international comparators to give the committee some information on what has happened on the comparators in the value for money review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400011#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366796700,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cooney.  As the Reserve Defence Force comes into the single force concept, the only way we can deliver on that within that structure, is if the availability and the quality of the Reserve Defence Force is guaranteed.  In order for such a guarantee to take place and any significant change in mindset we need to address the balance of support between the Government, the country and its reserves.  In order to guess the societal benefit of the reserves one has to pull that through the employers.  We are accountable to our employers.  If there was a need to mobilise reserves at short notice it would be very much a case of trying to provide the legislative enablers for that to that to happen.  In the international comparators examined in the value for money review the key commonality between New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom is that all of them have employment protection legislation and some of them use incentives in order to make use of the reserves.  All of them have employer liaison councils so that there is a dialogue between defence and industry.  Given the report in 1999 of the special study into the Reserve, a liaison council between employers and defence was recommended although it was not established.  Prior to that, the United Kingdom, which already has a significant source of support for reservists, is seeking to change its legislative measures in order that it can mobilise its reserves domestically with greater ease.  At present it must have a ministerial sign-off in order to call out the Reserves but it is seeking to make that a much more local issue.<\/p><p>  The key point is that without employment legislation it will be difficult to operationally use the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400011#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Gilbey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366796700,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I should like to address Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's second point in regard to personnel and the large numbers of unemployed persons.

In recent years we have been choked as a result of the restrictions on recruiting and promotion.  We have been choked of new lifeblood with an aging force.  It is a matter of great disappointment to us that we have not been able to offer the many young people who are unemployed and without direction something to do in the meantime.  Studies show that in times of recession and economic hardship, recruitment into such organisations is higher than at other times.

In fact, during the boom there were times when naval vessels could not have put to sea except that Naval Service Reserve provided enough personnel to make up a safe number of crew.  In addition, in the past we have provided safety boats for regattas and other maritime events.<\/p><p>  To address the point on using the unemployed, what mainly comes to mind is the new direction for the Naval Service Reserve in which the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, Commodore Mark Mellett, has pointed us.  That has us interacting with the University of Limerick and the industrial output.  Essentially, we have been directed to get involved with the underwater robotics section of the University of Limerick with a view to the development of new technologies that will aid the push to use the maritime resources.  It is an integral part of the renewable resource push for the maritime section.  We are to get involved with them and help develop their technologies.<\/p><p>  On another aspect that we are dealing with, we have talked with Mr. Se&aacute;n Cullen of the Geological Survey of Ireland.  They are tasked, among other matters, with carrying out the detailed surveying of the seabed.  One of the matters we have discussed with them is that they have a great deal of equipment, such as sonar scanning equipment and boats, but not necessarily the personnel whereas we have the personnel.  We had an establishment of 400 and it was reduced to 200 by the VFM.  For an island nation, we could fit the entire naval reserve into this one room here.  Looking at the Geological Survey of Ireland, we could train our Naval Service Reserve personnel to use its equipment in partnership with it.  At weekends and for week-long training periods we could use that equipment to carry out these detailed seabed surveys in coastal waters, in estuaries such as the Shannon Estuary, in Cork Harbour and in Dublin Harbour to the benefit of the State.  Also, these reserve personnel would then be trained to carry out such activities and giving them experience and, effectively, a trade.  That is where we are aiming.  It is a potential use of the NSR for the training of the unemployed, as was alluded to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400012#DD00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Colgan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366797300,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I might invite Mr. Patrick Mulley, given his civilian position, to address the issue of the unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400012#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366797300,"counter":993,"content":"<p>We approached the Minister two years ago when the internships came up.  We were looking at our own RDF members who were unemployed at that stage.  Their number has grown considerably since.<\/p><p>  On one of the problems that we encountered, I want to adjust what the Minister stated this morning on recruitment.  The RDF and the NSR never experienced a problem with recruitment.  We were restricted.  There is an embargo in place since 2008.  In 2007, the then Minister allowed us 700 recruits and the military allowed us 172.  It is not because of the recruitment issue that we find ourselves in the situation we are in today.<\/p><p>  However, one of the aspects that we looked at in some detail in the RDFRA two years ago was the T&uacute;s programme and the internship programme, both of which were coming on stream at the time.  We would still contend that those who have a number of years service in the RDF would be ideal candidates for an internship programme with the Defence Forces.  My last inquiry to the Department found that it was looking at this quite actively.  We stated it is a source where members could be utilised.  If the youth of the country could be taken up on those type of schemes, we would welcome that.  It would further enhance our training.  It would give us another leg-up on the training.  If we are to have the same capability as the PDF, we would envisage that if this programme works well we should arrive at a situation in three years' time where the local sergeant major, when he is looking to undertake a duty, could telephone an RDF member to ask if he or she is available for, say, a Wednesday.  He or she could be brought in for the duty in the same way that, say, Pennys stores would use their part-time staff.<\/p><p>  There is no point in looking at this in a regimented fashion.  We need to think outside the box and to have flexibility in the system.  As my colleague stated earlier, we need the Defence Forces to embrace the difference that is the RDF.  We have embraced the difference that is the PDF since we began.  There are differences, but these differences can be exploited to the benefit of the State, the PDF and, certainly, the people of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400012#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Mulley"},{"type":"speech","time":1366797300,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Has anybody else got a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400012#DD00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1366797300,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I am filling in for Deputy Mac Lochlainn who has another engagement.

The witnesses might quantify how that has been implemented across the RDF.<\/p><p>  The other question relates to the value-for-money report itself.

On one of the other points, the payments to RDF members are being reduced to &euro;2.5 million.<\/p><p>  On the availability to train, we need to correct what the Minister stated this morning.  Nobody, under normal circumstances, is paid a gratuity unless he or she has completed a set criteria of training.  That criteria of training to qualify for the gratuity is that they must have recorded 48 voluntary hours in the year, they must have undertaken their annual range practice and they must also complete one week's full-time training.  A gratuity was never paid to those who did not train.  That is something that needs to be corrected.<\/p><p>  On the numbers or members who are available for training, when the big cuts came in 2008, we enjoyed 66,000 man days, that is, the allocation given to the RDF.  That number of man days was halved and was reduced to 33,000.  The arithmetic is simple.  If one has 66,000 one year, one cannot bring the same number of members to camp the following year.  We experienced the same through the 1980s, when the number of man days was reduced.  At the time there were approximately 1,500 in the FCA and we could not bring those members to camp.  It is not fair to say, if one cuts the number of man days from 66,000 to 33,000, that one will have the same number of members attending training.  One cannot have it like that because it is not available for them to take up.<\/p><p>  On the budget that was allocated, the CRE, which was referred to this morning in the Minister's statement, reported back in December 2011.  It was claimed, in the CRE report, that the McCarthy recommendations had been met, which was to reduce the numbers in the RDF by two thirds.  It can be seen that we did not have part in reducing the numbers.  They were forced upon us.  It was also claimed in the CRE report that the budget of the RDF had been reduced by &euro;5.8 million.

The value for money review identified the effective strength of the reserve at 95% in 2006 and 87% in 2011.  The reserve is a volunteer organisation involving people who give up their own time.  The vast majority of the work is unpaid and people receive no compensation for it.  The report found 87% of a volunteer organisation is effective.<\/p><p>  The gratuity is an example of an inflexible system placing restrictions on reservists.  The review states in 2011 only 61% availed of paid man days.  As my colleague stated, to get the gratuity one had to complete eight field days, eight training nights, an annual personal weapons test and at least one week full-time training.  An individual in my unit had 17 field days, two weeks of full-time training, an annual personal weapons test and seven parade nights.  He was one night short and did not get his gratuity.  This shows inflexibility.  When one totals up the hours they are far in excess of the minimum he was required to do.  He had done 17 Sundays but because he was one night short he did not get his gratuity.  He does not come within the figures.  This is a flawed analysis of how we work.<\/p><p>  I was based in Mullingar and my unit and my offices were closed in February 2012.  No alternative location was provided for my platoon to train until September.  I had personnel who had to satisfy certain training criteria to obtain their gratuity but the State had implemented a position whereby we could not attain it.  In a civilian capacity I could consider judicial review because there is a case of legitimate expectation and the Government has put in place a system whereby we cannot obtain it.  In employment terms it would be constructive dismissal.  These are my comments on the findings of the value for money review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400013#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1366797900,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>This is how it was in the past.

The system has been put in place and in the first year there is a reduced requirement because reorganisation had to take place.  The start date was 1 April for the new units.  In the first year personnel will be required to do 32 hours of unpaid training, one week of full-time training and four hours of experiential training, which is further unpaid training.  I do not know what is the difference between this experiential training and the other 32 hours of unpaid training.  It seems one can be called in at any time for any reason.  In the second year the requirement will be to do 48 hours with eight hours experiential training.  The third year requirement will be to do 48 hours with 12 hours experiential training.  If one is told to come in on a Monday and Tuesday to complete 12 hours experiential training and one physically cannot do so because of work, a sick child or a lack of annual leave, one cannot meet one's requirement.  If the system is inflexible and cannot be used in consultation with the reservist he or she cannot meet the requirements.<\/p><p>  The biggest cost attached to the reserve was the Permanent Defence Force administering it.  The loss of the Permanent Defence Force to the reserve will be huge.  Those personnel had significant experience of us and understood how we worked.  They understood the restrictions on us on a daily basis.  We will now be put in a Permanent Defence Force unit of full-time professional soldiers, many of whom have never had experience of the reserve.  They do not understand the restrictions on us, and they are being asked to do this in addition to their other duties.  We are being imposed upon them and they will not get anything extra for it.  They do not know us or our capabilities.  After the value for money review I am surprised I can breathe unassisted but this is what they see.

There is a full-time Civil Defence officer in every county which costs a significant amount of money every year plus the cost of their equipment  and whatever.<\/p><p>  As we are discussing the Civil Defence, I wish to draw the following to the attention of the committee.  First, the Civil Defence has grown a lot in recent years since 9\/11 in terms of budget, which was &euro;5 million before the IMF came to town.  The Civil Defence and the Irish Coast Guard, which has 1,000 members, carry out very good functions in response to major emergencies, local requests and other instances as an aid to the civil authority.  The RDF can also respond to floods, gorse fires and weather incidents.  In addition, the RDF can raise its response to a superior level because it is an armed service.  We can be armed, if required.<\/p><p>  Second, the Civil Defence, Coast Guard and such voluntary organisations do not have the same contractual obligations as the RDF.  If a national crisis or major emergency lasts for more than a week or two, Civil Defence and Coast Guard members will get some sort of subsistence pay, but that will not be enough to pay their mortgages or feed their children and eventually they will have to go home.  The RDF is contractually obliged and its members have enlisted.  If the Minister sees fit to mobilise us full-time, then we are mobilised full time at the service of the State and subject to military law.  We cannot go home and must remain at the scene.  That is a personal risk we take as reservists and it could prove quite costly to us.  That is the advantage of the RDF over organisations like the Civil Defence and Coast Guard.  The RDF is on the hook, more or less, can be mobilised full-time and is at the full disposal of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013042400014#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Colgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366798500,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I note from the review that the RDF cannot perform armed duties in aid to the civil power.

When the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 was enacted, we were allowed to mobilise and were mobilised throughout the 1970s at the Border and other places.  The amendment in 2007 was a retrograde step and unnecessary as there is no cognitive difference between an RDF person and a PDF person.<\/p><p>  In regard to the training and the type of training, let us examine the historical side of it.  In 1972, in the region of 274 people were performing full-time security duties and that lasted over two and half years.  As we said in the 1999 report, we have not changed, our cognitive abilities have not changed and our volunteerism has not changed.

This is not a bad day to be addressing the committee, following a fantastic first day at the Punchestown festival, where we had a record crowd and the pleasure of watching a fantastic horse, Sprinter Sacre, the highest unofficial ratings horse over jumps since Arkle 50 years ago.<\/p><p>  I am Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, which is the commercial semi-State body responsible for the development and promotion of the thoroughbred horse racing and breeding industry in Ireland.  Horse racing is, arguably, Ireland&rsquo;s most successful international sport and contributes almost &euro;1 billion annually to the economy.  Ireland breeds more thoroughbred horses than Britain or France and is the fourth largest producer in the world.  Horse breeding is primarily an agricultural industry, sustaining up to 16,000 jobs, mostly in rural Ireland.  Last year thoroughbred exports from Ireland to more than 35 countries were worth in excess of &euro;174 million and bloodstock sales are one of the few positives in the wider economy, having grown in each of the past three years.  It is exactly the sort of industry that will help Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.  It is labour-intensive, rural-based, export-led, environmentally friendly and one in which Ireland has significant natural advantages in terms of both human resources and our environment.<\/p><p>  Much of the demand for our horses is driven by overseas buyers as a result of the winning performances of Irish horses at the top level across the globe.  In the past month we have seen Irish horses win at group one level in Cheltenham, Aintree, Japan and Dubai.  This success encourages owners to have horses in training here or to keep their breeding stock here, generating significant rural employment.  It is said that three horses equate to one job in our industry.  This is a fiercely competitive area and we must use every advantage to stay ahead.  Ireland is struggling to compete with better-funded countries who can offer bigger prize money to attract the best horses into their racing industries.  In some areas of the industry, many participants, including some racecourses, struggle to survive as reduced disposable income has an inevitable effect.<\/p><p>  Sponsorship of races is one of the key components of keeping our prize money at an internationally competitive level.  Sponsorship of racing by the drinks industry has always been a feature of our sport.  It represents approximately 10% of the total commercial sponsorship pool for racing.  Sponsors spend a great deal more in marketing race meetings and in entertaining customers and staff at the races than just the sponsorship fee.  The total value of drinks industry sponsorship to racing is in excess of &euro;1 million a year.  Racing has a culture of responsibility around it.  We do not permit inappropriate sponsorships and racecourses work with their drink company sponsors in applying codes of practice.  Racing is demonstrably aimed at an older rather than an under-age audience.  Research shows that the typical racegoer in Ireland is aged 35 or over and experience shows that race meetings are good-natured and convivial events, perhaps the very place where younger adults might observe how to drink and socialise in a responsible manner.<\/p><p>  Let me be clear.  Racing supports the regulation of alcohol promotion, with an emphasis on the protection of younger people.  However, that is not what is being proposed.  What is being proposed is a ban, a blunt and crude instrument which takes no account of the likelihood of actually achieving the desired result on a case-by-case basis.  Advertising is permitted under strict regulation and the same should be done for sponsorship.  It would be wrong to imagine that racing can find alternative sponsors.  Commercial sponsorship in racing has halved since 2007, and even in good times, it is the toughest of sales to make.  In addition, our famous Irish drinks brands are the product of marketing expertise, which adds greatly to the development of our major festivals and brings an international audience to Irish racing.  For example, if sponsorship were banned, while Irish racing fans would have the Hennessy Gold Cup from Newbury beamed to their living rooms, computers and mobile phones, Leopardstown would have to drop one of Irish racing&rsquo;s most loyal sponsors.  Hennessy has been sponsoring the Hennessy Gold Cup for 22 years, coming to Leopardstown in February every year and bringing senior executives and customers from the world&rsquo;s largest luxury brand groups to Dublin.  Hennessy uses the Leopardstown meeting not just for sponsorship but to entertain key business contacts, media people and friends at the races.  The public face of the Hennessy brand is Maurice Hennessy, an eighth-generation descendant of Cork man Richard Hennessy, who founded the firm in 1765.<\/p><p>  There are other sponsorships.  The Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse is one of our sport's oldest sponsorships, unbroken since 1960.  Today at Punchestown we will see the running of the Guinness Handicap Chase.  Guinness support for the Punchestown festival over many years has helped that meeting to grow, to the extent that it now delivers a &euro;60 million annual stimulus to the local economy in Kildare.  A similar scenario applies to festival meetings at Galway, Listowel and other courses throughout the country.  This is achieved in combination with the expertise of sponsors, including drinks sponsorship companies.  This expertise and ability to promote race meetings goes far beyond the financial contribution made and all of these festivals would be at a significant loss without this expertise.  Festival meetings are also a significant boost for our tourism industry.  It is estimated that we will have 18,000 UK visitors at Punchestown this week and race meetings in Ireland attract 80,000 overseas visitors a year to the country.<\/p><p>  Two things stand out in the debate on this subject so far.  There seems to be an illusion that sponsorship imagery can somehow be contained in the borderless digital age we are now in, and an assumption that sporting rights holders can handle the removal of this sponsorship.  It seems that a basic error is being made in the recommendation to ban sports sponsorship by the drinks industry.  The error is the assumption that a ban will actually work.  We hear advocates of a ban describing the problem of alcohol abuse in society, without sustaining the case that a sponsorship ban will solve it.  We hear, in effect, the case for prohibition.  Where does that end?   Racing asks for regulation in place of a ban.  We ask for a case-by-case approach, only taking action where there is a clear risk of harm.  We ask that racing&rsquo;s unique role in Irish society be seen as an example of responsible and social drinking in a regulated environment, in place of harmful drinking, which takes place largely in anti-social contexts.  Our drinks industry sponsors and our racegoers have added significantly to the social and cultural life of Ireland for generations and continue do so.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, a ban of sponsorship in Ireland would mean that it would be okay for Irish racegoers to watch and bet on the John Smith&rsquo;s Grand National in Aintree, the Hennessy Gold Cup in Newbury and the Grey Goose Breeders' Cup in America, but not on the Powers Gold Cup in Fairyhouse or the Guinness Galway Hurdle.  It would be okay for racegoers to be exposed to advertising on the way to a race meeting or during the TV coverage of the meeting, but not for sponsorship of races at that meeting.  It would also mean a loss of at least &euro;1 million a year to Irish racing and would hand a significant advantage to our competitors in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400003#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1366792200,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh for his well-presented submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400003#E00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366792200,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity afforded to the federation to address the committee here today.

It is easy to assume in a country as passionate about sport as we are that sport is something which simply happens, or that the success Irish sport has enjoyed in recent years in terms of increased success on the international stage and the growing number of people who are partaking in sport at home is a lucky coincidence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Sport, although it has a largely voluntary work force, still needs to be managed, planned, delivered and, above all, financed.  Money for sport matters and funding is crucial.  It would be naive to believe that only the three major field sports would suffer from the introduction of a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sport.  The removal of an entire category of sponsor would reduce the pool of available sponsors to all of Irish sport, reducing both the availability and the value of the overall sponsorship pool.  This would damage all of Irish sport.<\/p><p>  The reality is that funding for sport is already in short supply.  In particular, overall Government investment has dropped from a peak of &euro;311 million in 2008 to just over &euro;54 million for the current year.  Irish Sports Council funding, on which our members are so reliant, has fallen from just over &euro;57 million in 2008 to just over &euro;43 million for the current year.  This decline in Government funding has been matched by increased pressure on other revenue streams, in particular, member affiliations, ticket prices, where applicable, and sponsorship.  Our members, many of whom struggled to get sponsorship during the best of times, maintain they have never operated in such a challenging sponsorship environment.  This is backed up by the reality that some of our most prominent sporting brands have yet to confirm sponsorship agreements for the coming season.<\/p><p>  In addition, sport, unlike the rest of the not-for-profit sector, does not benefit from charitable status.  This is a reality that places sport at a distinct disadvantage in terms of attracting philanthropic investment compared to the remainder of our colleagues in the not-for-profit sector, for example, those in arts and culture.  When discussing sports funding, it is important to reflect on the return that sports provides to the people.  The real impact of sport to Ireland is not only on the playing fields or in the sports facilities dotted throughout the country.  Irish sport has a significant impact on our communities.  Ms O'Shea has already referred to the fact that more than 500,000 Irish adults volunteer in sport each year.  This makes sport the biggest single driver of active citizenship in Ireland.  A depletion of funding streams would inevitably lead to a redirection of funding from programmes benefiting our communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The economy is another consideration.  Some 40,000 jobs are supported in Ireland from sports.  It generates &euro;1.8 billion of household spending each year and contributes 1.4% to GDP.  A reduction in funding is likely to see pressure on jobs supported by the sports industry in Ireland.  Sport delivers dividends of in excess of &euro;850 million in tourism receipts to Ireland.  Banning alcohol sponsorship is likely to have a significant impact on Ireland's ability to bring international sports events to Ireland.  The Volvo Ocean race, the Ryder Cup, the European Rugby Cup finals are all examples of past and future sports events coming to Ireland that are dependent on alcohol sponsorship.<\/p><p>  Irish sport recognises the significant health and social challenges facing Irish society from alcohol misuse.  However, there are many ways in which these issues can be addressed.  This point is outlined by the report of the task force on substance misuse which made 45 recommendations regarding the issue, only one of which is the issue before us today.  The report also commended the sports industry for its adherence to the existing self-regulation codes, including, for example, the non-display of alcohol sponsors on underage replica jerseys.  Irish sport is firmly of the view that a ban on alcohol sponsorship in sports would have a detrimental effect on Irish sports and on the returns sports generates for Ireland.  There is a better way which, we believe, is at least worth trying before such a blanket ban is introduced.  The alternative is for active engagement between sport and public health officials to ensure that Ireland's sporting network, which is unrivalled in terms of its reach and the number of people involved, can assist the Government in the implementation of its strategy to tackle responsible alcohol usage and other public health issues.  When he was before the committee recently, the director general of the GAA, Paraic Duffy, highlighted two programmes the GAA is currently running to address these issues, the alcohol and substance abuse prevention, ASAP, programme and the healthy clubs project.  This is something that all in sport would be willing to adopt and roll out.  The federation in conjunction with the HSE would be more than happy to facilitate this process.<\/p><p>  If a ban on alcohol sponsorship was introduced, where would the line be drawn?  Sport could be left vulnerable to similar plans on sponsors from other sectors such as food, soft drinks and betting, thereby further reducing the pool of potential sponsors and, ultimately, funding for support.  Sport is good for our economy and it is good for our health.  More important at the moment, it is good for our communities.  Irish sport matters but it does not simply happen.  We need to encourage funding for sport not obstruct it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1366792800,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Shea and Ms O'Connor for their opening statements.

The organisation we represent, the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, DIGI, is the wider representative body for the drinks industry in Ireland.  Membership includes manufacturers, distributors, pubs, hotels, restaurants and the independent off-licence sector.  It is an important sector of the Irish economy contributing over &euro;2 billion in taxation revenue per annum, supporting over 62,000 local jobs and it is responsible for &euro;2.8 billion worth of purchases per annum.  Our quality brands are exported throughout the world contributing over &euro;1 billion in exports.  We are proud of the high-quality, premium brands we produce.<\/p><p>  The drinks sector plays an important role in Irish tourism by being part of the positive image of Ireland abroad and through developing many of the now iconic tourist attractions, such as the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin and the Middleton Distillery in Cork.  They are now the largest paid tourist attractions in Ireland.  Last year they welcomed in the region of 1.5 million visitors through their doors.  The Irish pub is consistently cited as one of the main attractions by tourists.  The most recent edition of <i>Lonely Planet<\/i>, one of the world's best-selling travel guides, has ranked going to a pub as the greatest experience a tourist can have in Ireland.<\/p><p>  DIGI is committed to promoting our industry and to advocating policies that allow for its sustainable development.  I emphasise that the misuse of alcohol is not in the interests of our industry or its sustainable development.  It damages our members, brands and the societies in which we operate.  We are very clear that we want to work with the Oireachtas, the Government, policymakers and professionals to identify and implement measures which reduce misuse.  We are also clear that we do not want to see measures introduced, albeit with the best intentions, that do not reduce misuse but that simply damage an important indigenous Irish industry.<\/p><p>  I will outline why we believe long-term educational measures, as opposed to eye-catching but ineffectual bans, are the way forward.  Before we move to the solutions and measures, let us identify clearly what the problem is.  Alcohol misuse must not get confused with alcohol use.  Used responsibly and in moderation, alcohol is part of a healthy lifestyle.  There is often a perception put forward that somehow alcohol misuse is increasing in Ireland.  For example, committee members were told last week that Ireland had a runaway drinking culture.  It simply does not.  Alcohol consumption in this country has fallen by over 19% in the past ten years and is fast approaching European norms.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs state of the nation's children report shows that the number of young people stating they have never had an alcoholic drink has increased by 35% in the past eight years.  The recent UNICEF report found the percentage of young people who reported having been drunk on more than two occasions has fallen in Ireland and in a detailed survey of 29 countries, Ireland is at average levels.<\/p><p>  While weakness in the domestic economy and the continued pressure on discretionary income are clearly having a negative impact on the drinks industry, there has been a substantial societal shift in many areas leading to reduced alcohol consumption.  We began to see significant declines in overall alcohol consumption in the years before the recession hit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400004#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366793400,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I thank the four people who made presentations to the committee.

The beer market in Ireland is declining but we are spending our sponsorship money there.  We do not do this for altruistic reasons.  I can speak for my company, Diageo.  We do it because we want the consumer to drink our brand and we compete against someone else's brands.  That is the nature of competition and it is a very healthy way to do business.

Some of Mr. O'Brien's evidence was contradictory in the sense that sporting bodies are being supported to the tune of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million.  Surely the drinks companies expect some return from that.  Will Mr. O'Brien explain why the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland is so enthusiastically opposed to any proposed ban?  Obviously it is doing so in order to maximise the return obtained from this type of sponsorship.  In such circumstances, there is a slight contradiction in the arguments Mr. O'Brien is presenting.  Having said that, I am not really in favour of the introduction of a ban because I do not believe it will have the desired effect in light of the open nature of our media.<\/p><p>  Whatever about the merits of introducing some restrictions in respect of sports involving younger people, the idea that we would introduce a ban in respect of the horse racing industry is nonsensical.  Primarily, that industry attracts a mature audience.  As Mr. Kavanagh suggested, the average age of racegoers is 35.  Such people would obviously be regarded as responsible adults who will make their own choices in respect of their consumption of alcohol.  As Mr. Kavanagh also stated, the horse racing industry is extremely important and is worth &euro;1 billion to the economy.  There are over 15,000 people employed in the industry here.  In my constituency, the Galway racing festival provides a huge annual boost to the local economy of something in the region of &euro;60 million.  This is replicated at the Leopardstown and Punchestown festivals.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Punchestown and it was extremely encouraging that a record number of people were in attendance at the festival yesterday.  The horse racing industry faces a number of challenges, not least among which is the fact that the numbers attending race meetings are diminishing.  The calibre of horses that have been involved in this year's festival would simply not have been brought by their owners if the prize money on offer was not pitched at an acceptable level.  As Mr. Kavanagh pointed out, one of the most highly rated steeplechasers in history ran in one of yesterday's races.  That was the case because of the status of the Punchestown festival.  It has gained that status over many years as a result of the support it receives from a plethora of advertisers and primarily those in the drinks industry.  The festivals at Galway, Punchestown, Leopardstown and Fairyhouse are all examples of how the drinks industry is making a very valuable contribution to the sport.<\/p><p>  The numbers attending race meetings have fallen sharply and the Government is considering alternative ways of funding the industry.  However, the suggestion that we should introduce a ban on one of the major sources of revenue for that industry is simply not correct.  We must keep the owners interested and satisfied.  There has been a decrease in the level of sponsorship for the horse racing industry in recent years and prize money is the key factor in keeping the owners on board.  The Irish are renowned the world over for the quality of the horses they produce for national hunt and flat racing.  This is due to smaller owners in rural areas who own mares which produce quality foals.

The sponsor buys the right to name the race so the Hennessy Gold Cup would not longer be called that if there was no sponsor.  This relates to the issue raised by Deputy Walsh.  The prize money in horse racing goes to the issue of international competitiveness.  Sprinter Sacre ran at Punchestown yesterday - a number of other very good horses will be running there later in the week - because those who run the festival engaged with our sponsors approximately two months ago.  They realised that Cheltenham and Aintree had increased their prize money and, as a result, they approached the sponsors in search of extra money, they asked us to match this and they dipped into their own pockets.  As a result, they were able to increase the value of yesterday's race in order to encourage the owners of Sprinter Sacre to allow the horse to run.  This had an obvious knock-on effect on the attendance at the meeting.  I wish to reiterate that in our industry - I am sure the position is the same in other sports - prize money gives rise to an issue of international competitiveness.  If we do not have the right level of prize money, people will not bring their horses here either to run or to be trained.  They will go where the best prize money is on offer.  There is no sponsorship ban in the UK and they will race their horses in Britain rather than Ireland.<\/p><p>  In the context of what the Chairman stated, I am of the view that it would be wrong to confine the value of the drinks companies' sponsorship to the actual cash amounts they invest in sporting events or races.  What they also bring is a very high level of marketing expertise.  Deputy Walsh referred to the Galway festival, which is a product of those who run the track working very closely with the sponsors - Guinness is the principal sponsor - to develop the meeting.  In research carried out by UCD in respect of the festival, it was estimated that it is worth &euro;60 million to the local economy each year.  That is not just the position in Galway.  I refer, for example, to the seven-day festival held in Listowel, which is probably the biggest of its kind in that part of the country and, again, those who organise it work closely with the sponsors, who invest money in the prize fund and who bring their marketing and promotional expertise to the development side.  That is very valuable to the racing sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400006#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366794000,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the Chairman's initial question on the value of sponsorship.

Behind the glamour and facade of glamour that is presented, I keep thinking about the people who are lying in hospital beds as a result of the abuse of alcohol.  Even today a significant article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> tells of children as young as 15 years of age ranging up to those in their middle 40s who are suffering from liver disease.  The incidence of liver disease has doubled in this country since 1995.  I often wonder whether any of the representatives take any responsibility for that.  Does it ever impact on them when they are sitting around having discussions with Horse Racing Ireland and everybody else the damage that the abuse of drink has on people not only in Irish society but generally?  That is my question and I direct it to Mr. O'Brien.  Does he have any responsibility for that?  He is one of the major players in the Irish drinks market.  What does his group do in terms of health promotion or helping those who are involved in trying to stem the flow in that respect?  Irrespective of his statistics, the overall figure might be decreasing but that does not take form the reality that more and more people are suffering as a result of the abuse of drink.  He can say that is their choice but the glamorous way in which drink sponsorship is presented goes a long way towards creating the scenario we are in.  With the industry having been severely restricted in how it can present drink on television and the printed media, the better option for it is to present it in a glamorous way.  <\/p><p>  I am concerned as well about thresholds and I would like Mr. O'Brien to also answer this question.  In view of the restrictive nature of the manner in which the industry presents drink, particularly in television advertisements, there was a certain age threshold that was supposed to be used by models.  I believe that age threshold has been breached regularly.  It has come down further and further to the point where it is now hitting those who are in their late teens and early 20s.<\/p><p>  We have heard from Horse Racing Ireland about all the money that is being put into the industry, how important it is and that it would be terrible if a race such as the Hennessy Gold Cup were to be lost.  Any of the representatives who are  involved in commercial sponsorship will know that branding constantly changes.  One of the most popular games in the world is soccer and the premiership in England changes its sponsorship regularly.  Other premiership national leagues across Europe and the world regularly change their sponsorship.  In Ireland, the League of Ireland changes its sponsorship.  I do not know what is the problem in that regard.  If that race is not going to be called the Hennessy Gold Cup, it would be called something else.  <\/p><p>  The figure of &euro;35 million in respect of sponsorship was mentioned.  Does that figure represent the totality from sponsorship in sport in Ireland or only the sponsorship accruing from the drinks industry?  <\/p><p>  I do not want to single out Horse Racing Ireland but I would agree with Mr. Peter O'Brien that of all the sporting activities, horse racing is probably the one that I would be least concerned about in terms of health impact from sponsorship.  Would I be right in saying that Horse Racing Ireland does not have any great difficulty in getting sponsorship, that people would be queuing up to offer sponsorship because it is a branded product?  I refer particularly to many of the multinationals, that are of a non-drink nature, as it were, that have located in this country in recent years.  Is there any doubt in his mind that the group will not continue to get drink sponsorship given that those multinationals see it as one of the very few areas where they can promote their products?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J00600","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I could continue, but my primary purpose in raising these issues is that I would like to know from all of the representatives, particularly those from the drinks industry, if they have any responsibility in terms of the impact the abuse of their product has on a growing number of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J00800","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I thank all the representatives for their presentations which were particularly well made.  Mr. Brian Kavanagh's point on the digital age and the difficulty, if drinks sponsorship was banned in Ireland, of controlling visual images from events abroad which sponsor drinks was well made.  In other words, would it be implementable?  There are some issues to which I would like the representatives to respond.  We had psychiatrists before the committee last week who would take a totally opposite view on this from that of the representatives.  I ask them to respond to one of the comments that psychiatrists made.  They said:<blockquote><br \/>While common sense tells us that sponsorship promotes consumption, with typical arrogance the alcohol industry, and those in receipt of its money, demand that we provide them with the evidence that it does.  It is this multi-billion euro industry that should be required to provide proof, if they have proof that alcohol sponsorship does nothing to increase alcohol-related harm.<\/blockquote>I would be interested to hear the representatives' answer to that accusation.  <\/p><p>  Another point the psychiatrists strongly made was that over the years the drinks companies have infiltrated sport and now have control of it and that sport cannot shake itself free from them.  I would be interested to hear the representatives response to that comment.  The psychiatrists also made the point that millions of euro is being spent in our health service to treat people who are addicted to drink.  They also made the point that children and young people involved in sport become very brand aware as a result of sponsorship.  In other words, sport is used as the vehicle to make them brand aware at a very young age.  <\/p><p>  I would like Mr. Brian Kavanagh to respond to a further point.  I asked the representatives of the GAA, rugby and soccer when they appeared before the committee about the presence of drink being consumed by those in the crowd during an event, be it big matches being played in the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park or elsewhere.  The GAA bans people from bringing drink onto the terraces while the IRFU does not.  It presents an awful sight to see somebody with a pint of larger in a plastic container in their hands as the event is going on.  I would like to ask Mr. Brian Kavanagh about Horse Racing Ireland's policy on that at race courses - such as at Punchestown at the moment - around the country.  How is the consumption of drink portrayed at race courses?  Are children at race meetings allowed to wander in and out and are they being exposed to all of this or what prevention or education systems does it have in place?  Does it use some of the money it get from the drinks industry to educate people to behave responsibly with regard to drink?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J00900","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Who will take those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J01000","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366794600,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1366794600,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>Mr. Brian Kavanagh will begin and some of the questions were directed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013042400007#J01200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366794600,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I will address those issues as best I can.

Every single person in an advertisement for alcohol in this country is over the age of 25, not just because their passport says it but because they look over the age of 25.  We have some of the most restrictive rules.  The suggestion that anyone in those advertisements is in any way appealing to teenagers is simply incorrect.  They are the rules we agree with the Department of Health and they are religiously enforced.  Nobody can advertise alcohol to an audience that has more than 25% under the age of 18.  The reality is that it is much more like approximately 15%.  Of course underage people get access to everything in life.  That is the reality of the world we live in, but it is simply incorrect to say that there is any targeting of anybody under the legal drinking age.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony, on the direct quote last week about consumption, I can only repeat again, there is no wine sponsorship in this country yet consumption is up 13%.

The witnesses outlined the benefits but it does not add up when one takes the cost into account.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that people representing sporting organisations sound like they are part of the drinks industry.  It is important that the Federation of Irish Sport clear up the situation.  If an alternative funding stream is found I hope the sporting organisations would be delighted to move away from the alcohol industry.  The issue of concern is funding and it should not be the case that the organisations are so dependent on the funding they receive that they have to justify advertising alcohol, which according to the medical profession is a bad thing.  I am a little bemused as to why anyone would think that the medical profession has an ulterior motive.  The medical profession has only one motive, namely, people&rsquo;s health.  It presented us with the facts.  It has no vested interest in anything other than health.<\/p><p>  Does alcohol advertising bring so much to Irish sport that we cannot do without it?  I accept it provides approximately &euro;35 million in sponsorship.  Could the &euro;1 million that is put into horse racing not be replaced with another source of funding?  If I am correct, it was mentioned that &euro;2 billion was paid in taxes by the alcohol industry.  We are making a loss then because alcohol abuse costs &euro;3.4 billion.  The industry might well contribute &euro;2 billion in taxes but it takes &euro;3.4 billion out.  We must find an alternative source of funding given that the medical experts have proven that it is a negative thing to have alcohol advertising and the sporting organisations require funding.  We could consider an increase in taxation on alcohol.  We have been told that the drinks industry pay &euro;2 billion in tax.  If we increase that by 2.5% it will pay an extra &euro;50 million.
