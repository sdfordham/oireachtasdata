We are an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  Only through further increasing our footprint internationally will we help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in Foodwise 2025, and has been demonstrated by the OECD and FAO, there is a rising demand globally for animal proteins, particularly in emerging economies in Asia and Africa and we are looking to build on and to further develop opportunities in these regions.  We are also aware of the potential to grow Irish market share in countries which consume significant animal protein already, such as Canada, the United States and Mexico.  The current uncertainty about Brexit brings home the importance of diversification and this is also driving our efforts to develop alternative outlets for our major commodities.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I developed the 7 point action plan to increase market access and exports and work under these actions is underway.  These actions have included an intensification of the programme of Trade Missions. Following on from a very successful Mission to the USA and Mexico in June, planning is underway for another Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November. These are key potential meat and dairy markets and market access is being pursued for beef in South Korea and sheepmeat in Japan. <\/p>  <p>  To further guide activities Bord Bia was tasked with identifying priority new markets for Irish food and drink.  This work is underway and the initial results are feeding into the Department now.  More detailed analysis will follow and the output of this exercise will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of a major market diversification drive I recently announced additional funding of &euro;6.7 million to Bord Bia. This is additional to previous funding granted in 2016 and 2017.

To this end we have had inspection visits from both China and South Korea in recent months. The feedback from both inspection teams was broadly positive as we move closer to having access for beef approved for these markets. My Department is also working to broaden existing Market access and has a number of successful outcomes recently including changes to the veterinary certification for beef to South Africa and Singapore which has broaden access and opportunities for export. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the meat and dairy industry, Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassies in pursuit of new opportunities internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Funding","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[41230\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the allocation in the rural development plan for the TAMS scheme 2014-2020; the amount of funds approved to date for projects since its inception; the payments made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Under the TAMS II scheme, support is provided under a suite of seven measures:<\/p><p>- Young Farmers Capital \u00a0Investment Scheme;<\/p><p>- Dairy\u00a0Equipment Scheme; <\/p><p>- Organic Capital Investment Scheme; <\/p><p>- Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme; <\/p><p>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading;\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme; <\/p><p>- Tillage Capital Investment Scheme.<\/p><p>A wide range of investment items are available under each of these measures to help Irish farmers to improve their farms.<\/p><p>The\u00a0scheme is co-funded by the National Exchequer and the EU's\u00a0European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development under Ireland's Rural Development Programme.

These schemes were designed to provide financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farming enterprise. <\/p>  <p>  Under the EU Regulations governing these schemes, \u00a0a young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.\u00a0 A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the present agricultural activity.<\/p>  <p>  The National Reserve provides for an allocation of entitlements at the national average level or a top-up on existing entitlements that are below the national average to the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.\u00a0 In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and this cut provided some &euro;24 million in funding. Some 6,250 applicants were allocated entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, approximately 1,300 young farmers and new entrants applied for an allocation of entitlements under the National Reserve. Funding of some &euro;5 million has been made available from a linear cut to the value of all Basic Payment Scheme entitlements.

Payment is made to approx. 9,000 young farmers annually under the Young Farmers Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2017 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme was 15th  May, 2017. My Department is at an advanced stage of processing applications submitted and payments are due to commence in early December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme which is co-funded under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 has a broad range of investment items available for qualifying Young Farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Young Farmers can avail of the enhanced grant rate of 60% as compared to the standard rate of 40% . To date 2,466 approvals have issued to Young Farmers \u00a0and approvals continue on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review which was published as part of Budget 2015 set out the main policy objectives for continuing support to the sector through agri-taxation measures including increasing land mobility and the productive use of land: Budget 2015 included the doubling of the existing relief for income from long-term leasing of land and introduced a package of new measures to incentivise long-term leasing, which has a number of advantages over the conacre system. It allows progressive farmers to enlarge their farm holdings and increase productivity and also\u00a0allows young farmers and new entrants to the sector gain access to land by providing a cheaper means of long-term access to land, as opposed to the relatively high cost of land purchase. Leasing also provides security of tenure and the certainty required to encourage lessees to maintain and make investments in improving land and it provides a route to retirement for older farmers, assisting in generation renewal. There is already evidence of a significant increase in long-term leasing due to these changes.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0second objective of the Agri-taxation Review was to assist with succession and the transfer of farms: The age profile of Irish farmers is increasing and it is recognised that there are many social and economic reasons why succession management is a challenge for farmers. Assisting succession and the transfer of farms has been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy and Budget 2015 included a number of measures to maintain and strengthen that support, specifically the retention of Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax and the stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land. There were a number of new measures to make these reliefs more effective, including targeting Agriculture Relief at active and trained farmers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in June of this year, I launched the &lsquo;Succession Farm Partnership Scheme&rsquo;. The Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to assist with the transfers of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms. It also encourages important conversations within farm families about succession planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[41660\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the ongoing information technology problems and delays in relation to GLAS and AEOS payments will be resolved; the reason the information technology software is not able to recognise anomalies or changes in a person's circumstances which is adding to further delays; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>In the context of the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020 my\u00a0Department has delivered over twenty new schemes that were supported by IT capability.\u00a0In the first two years of the current RDP programme my Department has already implemented substantially more RDP schemes than were implemented over the entire ten year lifetime of the previous RDP programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This rate of delivery and draw-down would not have been possible without the availability of high quality complex IT software systems to support the business units in operating these schemes.

The Beef Data and Genomics Programme is the main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over Rural Development Programme period. <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0response to significant demand, earlier this year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds. There are currently\u00a025,669 participants.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of challenges facing the beef sector including the suckler sector in the short and medium term, particularly exchange rate volatility and Brexit. One of my priorities now is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally. We are an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.\u00a0By further increasing our footprint internationally will we can make a contribution to\u00a0mitigating the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the importance\u00a0of facilitating as many third country markets for beef as possible in addition to our traditional European markets. My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the primary producer. <\/p>  <p>  Live exports also play a vital role in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, including weanlings from the suckler herd at this time of year. It is an area that I have paid particular attention to since taking up office. Live exports for the year to date are up by over 50,000 head, or 48% compared to 2016. I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to tillage, this is a very important sector to the agricultural economy, and the Deputy will be aware of a number of measures I introduced in this regard to underpin the tillage sector and promote its growth into the future. <\/p>  <p>  Among these was a targeted crop loss support measure to assist growers most affected by the wet weather harvest conditions of September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the support measure for those worst affected, I also introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme which I specifically extended to include the Tillage and Horticulture sector. I have been advised by the banks that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.<\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I also introduced the\u00a0Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which\u00a0opened for online applications earlier this year. The second tranche is open and runs until 6th  October 2017.\u00a0There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure particularly in relation to precision equipment to improve profitability at farm level, with a total number of 490 applications received in the first tranche for the tillage sector alone. 450 approvals have now issued in respect of these and payments and approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, a range of other supports provide vital income and investment support \u00a0to both sectors including BPS, ANC, GLAS and\u00a0TAMS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[41648\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300058#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position the Government will take in relation to suggestions that the EU Commission will offer significant tariff rate quota concessions for beef to South America in the Mercosur trade negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>Ireland is a small open economy and Irish\u00a0Government policy is generally supportive of trade liberalisation.

The EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2005 on animal transport provides that stricter rules may be applied by member states than those set down at EU level.  DAFM has availed of this provision and, therefore the current Irish legislation, made possible by powers conferred to me under section 36 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, sets higher standards relating to the approval of ships for livestock transport than those which apply generally in the EU.  Indeed, our legislation is recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent in force as regards transport by sea.<\/p>  <p>  Only ships approved by My Department, with\u00a0the involvement of\u00a0Marine Surveyors\u00a0in the process,\u00a0can load cattle for export from Ireland.  Livestock being exported are monitored by my Department&rsquo;s veterinary inspectors during the prescribed isolation period, with the loading of cattle also supervised by officials of my Department.  All animals are inspected and must be certified as regards health status and fitness for travel and cattle on board a livestock ship departing from Ireland are typically bedded and penned in conditions very similar to cattle in any feedlot or cattle shed. In addition, due regard must be taken to weather conditions in respect of long distance transport and these measures contribute to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an exporter of livestock of high health status, which is vital to my Department&rsquo;s efforts to source additional markets abroad.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the importance of animals arriving at their destination in good condition, a Department veterinary inspector\u00a0 accompanies cattle shipments on occasion to monitor travelling conditions.  The most recent of these assessments occurred last month when an official of my Department accompanied livestock exported from this jurisdiction to Turkey and Lebanon which confirmed\u00a0that the cattle were well treated en route and the Turkish and Lebanese authorities were very satisfied with the condition of the animals they received. <\/p>  <p>  With a view to improving slaughter and transport standards in third countries, my Department, along with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

The objective of these sessions is to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit, and to engage in a process of strategic planning to ensure their companies have a robust strategy in place.

Lean tools and techniques help companies to address competitiveness issues within their businesses by building the capability of their people to identify problems and improve operations.  This programme is of benefit to all micro-enterprises, whether affected by Brexit or not.<\/p><p>Finally, along with the core LEO priming and business development grants, the LEOs are now offering two new funding programmes to assist micro-enterprises affected by Brexit.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base. However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.<\/p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.<\/p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.  It is estimated, based on the current rates and bands, that almost 770,000 income earners are exempt from the USC.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to continue the process of reducing the personal tax burden in future Budgets, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners, subject to having the required fiscal space.  In this context I have stated on a number of occasions that my long term view of the USC is to see its amalgamation with the existing PRSI system.  This is a complex undertaking that will take time to plan and implement, and will require further consideration of all the distinct features of the USC and PRSI systems, including the taxation of pre-95 public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[41281\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the detail of the Central Bank inquiry into a building society (details supplied) currently under way; the work that has been done to date; the costs incurred to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>Under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended) (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;), the Central Bank may hold an inquiry to determine whether or not a financial service provider is committing or has committed a suspected prescribed contravention.

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out in an action plan within the Report.  <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, conducted its own review of the rising cost of motor insurance and published its report in November 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  I am of the view that considerable overlaps exist between the two reports.  Therefore in implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, the Government has been addressing many of the recommendations contained in the Joint Committee's Report, including in such key areas as:<\/p>  <p>  - Consumer protection &ndash; e.g., providing breakdown of the calculation\/increase in premiums, improving conditions for returning emigrants, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - Enhancing transparency in the claims environment &ndash; e.g., establishing a National Claims Information Database, improving the quality of data in the Book of Quantum, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - Counteracting uninsured driving and fraud &ndash; e.g., establishing fully-functional databases in respect of uninsured drivers and insurance fraud, expediting the development of the Master Licence Record, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The second such update was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 21 July 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations, with a particular focus on the 17 action points which were due for completion in the second quarter of 2017.  All 17 of these action points have been completed by this deadline.  In total, all but one of the 27 action points due in the first two quarters of the year have been completed.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The third quarterly update will issue in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the continued implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for August) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained with the result that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[41562\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the recent speech by the French President (details supplied) in which he called for access to structural funds to be linked with co-operation on a European corporation tax policy by 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>I note the recent speech delivered by the French President to which the question refers.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Ireland's cooperation on corporation tax policy within Europe, Ireland has been very actively engaged with corporate tax proposals at EU level.

I am informed by Revenue that there are no specific tax exemptions available to international artists performing in the State. Artists who are not resident in the State for tax purposes have a liability to Irish tax on income arising from the exercise of their profession in the State.  However, because foreign resident artists merely have a transitory presence in the State, there are numerous practical difficulties associated with enforcing such a liability.  For example, the vast majority of non-resident entertainers do not file an Irish tax return and there is therefore no effective mechanism to quantify the potential tax exposure of such entertainers on the income related to their Irish performances and to collect any tax owing.  However, an alternative system which would impose an obligation on paying agents to deduct tax from payments made to foreign entertainers and account for the tax to Revenue, would also present many difficulties such as the requirement to identify the paying agent, in order to enforce collection, as well as placing a costly compliance burden, both on Revenue and the non-resident artists and paying agents.  Imposing tax therefore would be administratively cumbersome relative to the potentially small prospective yield and would also undoubtedly discourage some artists from performing in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I can however advise the Deputy that in general where a concert takes place in Ireland, the artists performance fee is subject to Irish VAT.  Where an international performer is engaged by a promoter, it is the responsibility of the promoter to account for the VAT due on the performance fee.  This means that where the promoter is established in Ireland, the promoter is required to account for Irish VAT on the performance fee.  In circumstances where the artist and promoter are both established outside the State, the promoter is required to account for VAT on the performance fee where she\/he is established.<\/p>  <p>  Where a premises provider allows a promoter who is not established in the State to hold a concert on their premises, the provider must report details of the event to Revenue.  Failure to do so can make the premises provider jointly liable for any VAT arising.  This is a safeguard provision to ensure the correct VAT is collected and paid in relation to any merchandise sold at the concert venue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[41754\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an issue relating to a PPS number for a person (details supplied) has been resolved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the person concerned should bring to the attention of his employer his error in providing an incorrect PPSN to them and ensure that the employment details and relevant tax credits are applied to him in line with the tax credit certificate issued by Revenue on 5 May 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[41765\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300062#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is possible to claim relief on the MED 2 form for dental treatment (details supplied).","asker":"1240","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for relief at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%) on certain health expenses incurred in the provision of health care. <\/p><p>For the purposes of the section &ldquo;Health Care&rdquo; is defined as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability but excluding routine ophthalmic treatment, routine dental treatment and unnecessary cosmetic surgery.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Health Expenses&rdquo; includes, inter alia, the costs of the services of a practitioner registered under the Dentists Act 1985<\/p><p>Therefore, an individual can claim tax relief in respect of non-routine dental care provided by a registered practitioner.<\/p><p>Non-routine dental treatment is not defined in legislation, but I have been advised by Revenue that a non-exhaustive list of relevant procedures is available on the Revenue website at: <i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question it is necessary to determine the purpose of the procedure to ascertain if tax relief is available.

Taxis or cars should only be hired when no suitable transport is available. Vouchers should be supplied with all such claims.<\/p><p>10. Travel and subsistence allowance is not payable for an absence at any place within 8 Kilometres of the school\/place of work or a person's normal place of residence.

Evidence of such compliance shall be made available on request to the person's supervisors or other officer authorised by the Chief Executive Officer.<br \/><br \/>b) His\/her motor insurance policy provides an indemnity to the TETB and covers use of the vehicle in the performance of official duties. It is the responsibility of the individual to explain to his\/her insurers the extent of use of the vehicle in the performance of official duties.<br \/><br \/>c) A distinction should be made between travelling incurred in the course of the day-to-day business and attendance at in-service training. d) Mileage claimed is in accordance with the ETB's approved schedule of mileages.

This move was aimed at giving parents a say on what, if any, uniforms a school should have and, in turn, to tackle the high costs of some uniforms.  This exercise\u00a0was carried out on a local basis by\u00a0individual school\u00a0managements.  There was no requirement on them to report the results to\u00a0the Department. <\/p><p>At my request the\u00a0National Parents Council Primary and National Parents Council Post Primary surveyed parents regarding their experience of this consultation process and they collated data\u00a0in May 2014.  They issued their\u00a0Report to the Minister for Education and Skills regarding the parents&rsquo; survey on the implementation of circular 0063\/2013.<\/p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:<\/p><p>- All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;<\/p><p>- Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;<\/p><p>- Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);<\/p><p>- Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;<\/p><p>- Provide a book rental scheme;<\/p><p>- Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;<\/p><p>- Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and;<\/p><p>- The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.<\/p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.<\/p><p>In relation to workbooks, the Circular advises that schools should phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused. <\/p><p>My Department is very aware of the appropriate contribution that well-designed learning activities can make in the classroom.  Resources that align well with the learning objectives of the curriculum (including workbook tasks) and which foster development of key skills and concepts are an important support for classroom learning and teaching and can help to consolidate students&rsquo; understanding. <\/p><p>Used skilfully, such activities can provide the teacher with valuable opportunities to promote independent learning; and for learners they can facilitate completion of differentiated activities or tasks at a number of levels.

This follows on from the identification of a number of issues in respect of the compliance by a number of schools constructed by WBS with their fire safety certificates.  My Department, at this stage, does not have any reason to believe that there are any fire safety issues in respect of any of the other buildings built by Western Building Systems.  These audits are a proactive measure being taken, following on from consultation with stakeholders, to satisfy the Department that there are no further issues with school buildings constructed by that company.\u00a0 It is anticipated that this will take approximately 6 months to complete this number of audits. \u00a0However, in each case, the Department will require an early report from the Fire Safety Consultants conducting the audit if any issue of significant concern is discovered.<\/p><p>Further to this and as previously announced, my Department is in the process of commissioning fire safety audits of a representative sample of up to 25 schools constructed over the last 20 years.  It should be noted that each school building is already required to have and comply with a fire certificate awarded at time of construction by the local authority.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the selection of a school to be included in the sample for this audit in no way means that my Department has concerns about that particular school.  Regarding the timeline for this sample audit, it is expected to be concluded by January 2018.  The tender for the appointment of fire safety consultants will be completed by the mid October.  It is expected that the first set of Fire Safety Audit Reports will be provided to my Department by the end of December 2017.<\/p><p>My Department will also contact the representative Professional Associations, principally the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland ((RIAI), Engineer&rsquo;s Ireland (IEI) and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland (ACEI) to discuss the operation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations (2014) to reiterate the responsibilities of Design Teams to fully engage in a complete and comprehensive way with the inspection and certification requirements of BC(A)R (2014).  It is the responsibility of the Design Team appointed to build a school to ensure that a newly constructed building is compliant with it&rsquo;s Fire Certificate.  My Department is writing to these associations to remind them of their members<b>&rsquo;<\/b>legal duties in this regard.<\/p><p>My Department has also written to all Design Teams working on buildings currently under construction to remind them of their responsibilities to ensure that all buildings comply with fire certificates awarded by the local authority<\/p><p>My Department will also issue a new Circular to all schools bringing the attention of the school authorities to their obligations in relation to Fire Safety management protocols.  Detailed guidance documents are already in place to advice schools on managing Health and Safety in schools that includes comprehensive advice on the issue of managing the risk of fire.<\/p><p>My Department will, going forward, appoint a Clerk of Works to all future major building projects to enhance the oversight and inspection of works when they are being carried out.  This person, who will be appointed by the Department of Education and Skills, will provide an extra layer of checking and oversight during the construction process.<\/p><p>Additionally, an internal fire safety committee is being established within my Department.

These policies drive Palestinians off the land in Area C, which comprises the majority of the West Bank, facilitating subsequent occupation by Israeli settlers.  The EU has consistently stated that such policies pose a threat to negotiations on a two-state solution.  Forcible transfer of this nature is expressly outlawed under international law. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that many of those communities, which are now under threat, are located where they are because they have already been relocated once from their former homes in Israel. <\/p>  <p>  The specific cases cited by the Deputies are just two of many communities so threatened.  Both villages have been under threat of demolition for many years, and the Israeli Defence Minister has recently stated that both removals will be carried out within months.  There are legal processes still ongoing in both cases, but there is no doubt about the real threat to these communities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been engaged with the cases of these two communities for several years, and previous Ministers have reported on our actions in that regard, including visits to the sites and attendance at court hearings.  In the case of Khan al-Ahmar, the Irish representative in Ramallah visited the village with a high-level diplomatic group on 20 September, in advance of the court hearing scheduled for 25 September, which was later postponed.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  <\/p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. <\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and the Government recently published a new National Disability Inclusion Strategy (2017 &ndash; 2021).  This strategy contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service Staff","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[41312\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and grade of staff at the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS; the number and grade of vacancies; his views on whether the service is adequately resourced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of the local authority.  The latter is a reserved function of the elected members and the Commissioner has no function in this regard.<\/p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors including commercial retail units.  This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The current phase of the national revaluation programme (known as &ldquo;REVAL 2017&rdquo;) covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area.  Revaluation in these counties was completed in September 2017 and will become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards. <\/p><p>The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001-2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.  The National Revaluation Programme is the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years and is being conducted across the country on a phased basis.  This is a welcome development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made.  Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area. <\/p><p>Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of all rateable properties in a local authority area and their respective commercial rates liabilities.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.  This applies to retail shops as it does to all other categories of property.  A key element of revaluation is to remove anomalies in the system where they exist and establish fair and equitable relativities between the various property classifications. <\/p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is an estimate of the\u00a0Net Annual Value\u00a0(NAV) of a property, at a specified valuation date, on the assumption that the occupier is responsible for the payment of commercial rates and for insuring and maintaining the property.  The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in\u00a0section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001\u00a0as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise.  In this regard, I am informed that the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties including retail shops in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally and well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts and the conclusion drawn from that analysis is applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties. <\/p><p>While some final Valuations Certificates issued as part of REVAL 2017 may result in increases in the rates liability of various property types, including some retail shops, possible reasons for such increases where they occur would be that the valuation of some of these properties had not been revised to take account of improvements, extensions or extensive refurbishment that was not reflected in the valuation immediately before the revaluation that is now in train.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the revaluation conducted by the Valuation Office in County Westmeath is likely to result in about 56% of ratepayers having their liability for rates reduced and about 39% having an increase with the remaining 5% of properties covering two categories, i.e. property whose rates liability will remain unchanged and some new properties which have been added to the valuation list for the first time. <\/p><p>With specific regard to the retail sector, the number of ratepayers expected to have reduced rates liability in 2018 will be of the order of 39% with 56% getting an increase.  In the case of those getting an increase, about a quarter will get a valuation increase in the lower range, i.e. 5% to 20%.  The percentage figures reflect the relative rental growth in some retail property <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other property categories such as office and industrial property.  In County Westmeath 79% of ratepayers occupying industrial property and 60% of ratepayers occupying office property will have a reduced rates liability post revaluation.<\/p><p>There is an extensive process of redress available to ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the valuations they have received from the Valuation Office.  Firstly in this regard, a dissatisfied person could have made representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue to them of the certificate of the proposed valuation earlier this year.  The Valuation Office considered the representations which were received and made any changes to the valuations that were necessary.  These changes were reflected in the final certificates of valuation which was issued to ratepayers on 7<sup>th<\/sup>September 2017.  Any ratepayer who is still dissatisfied with the final valuation which has been placed on their property following consideration of the representations, have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The final date for receipt of appeals by the Tribunal is 12<sup>th<\/sup>October 2017 and each ratepayer has been informed of this statutory deadline. <\/p><p>I am aware that certain business owners have stated that they face higher rates bills in 2018.  However, it is not the purpose of revaluation to increase or decrease the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities but rather to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  As a consequence, it is a fact that some ratepayers have seen the rateable valuation of their property increase while other ratepayers have seen a decrease. <\/p><p>Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business improvement Districts) Acts 2006, provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government intends to make further orders later this year in respect of rating authorities which have recently undergone revaluation.<\/p><p>In recent years, local authorities have been asked by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) and they have responded positively in this regard.  The Government recognises that these are difficult economic times for many businesses including the retail trade and will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency, and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK05100"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[41246\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300067#WRK05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has given consideration to the creation of a new regional family law judge position for the north west in view of the large number of family law cases there that are leading to long delays in the system and a large number of cases being listed for hearing on sitting days; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a start, I can inform the Deputy that Ireland has made a new\u00a0commitment to take a further 330 programme\u00a0refugees on top of its existing commitment\u00a0to take 1,040.\u00a0 The 330 additional programme refugees forms part of Ireland's commitment to take 4,000 migrants but is not yet reflected in Table 1 above as Ireland awaits developments at EU level and the\u00a0completion of the review I have requested\u00a0after which appropriate\u00a0decisions can be taken by Government and the necessary adjustments can\u00a0be made.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that If, despite all Ireland's efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in the number of asylum seekers foreseen under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, then the Government commitment to take in 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms.\u00a0\u00a0Decisions taken at EU level with regard to the ongoing migration crisis will of course impact on any such deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[41473\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in direct provision in each direct provision centre for one year or less, one to two years, two to three years, three to four years, four to five years and more than five years in 2016 and to date in 2017.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is not currently available in the detail required.  <\/p><p>Due to the complexities in gathering the statistics of &lsquo;duration of stay&rsquo; for RIA residents by individual centres, due in part to the constant inflow and outflow of said persons, these details are only compiled on an annual basis.\u00a0 The most recent information available is included\u00a0in the\u00a0Reception and Integration Agency Annual report 2016 which is published on the RIA website and can be accessed using the attached link: <i><\/i><\/p><p>Information on the overall duration of stay (not broken down by centre) is compiled and published on the RIA website on a monthly basis.\u00a0 The August 2017 monthly report provides the most recent information available on\u00a0the duration of stay of persons residing in State provided accommodation (based on their last entry into the State accommodation system).\u00a0 This information is also available on the RIA website and can be found using the attached link:<i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Trafficking","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[41480\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the detail of his Department's engagement with a group (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Santa Marta Group is a global alliance of international Police Chiefs and religious leaders\u00a0which partners\u00a0with civil society and business leaders with the objective of eradicating\u00a0human trafficking and modern day slavery.

However, despite all Ireland's efforts it has proven extraordinarily difficult to find\u00a0unaccompanied minors in Greece within the cohort eligible for relocation.  <\/p>  <p>  All strands of the IRPP have had a strong focus on families and children and almost half of the admissions to-date have been minors, with almost 85% of this figure aged under 12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Migrant Integration","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[41534\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the integration strategy for refugees and asylum seekers who arrive here; if he will provide a copy of the strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>The Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for the Government's action to promote the integration of all migrants legally in the State, including refugees, for the period to 2020.\u00a0 It sees integration as a two-way process involving action by migrants and non-migrants alike.\u00a0 The Strategy comprises 76 specific actions under a number of themes to be implemented by Government Departments and Agencies, the business sector, employers, local authorities and community and voluntary sector organisations.\u00a0 Among other actions, the Strategy requires Government Departments and agencies to address integration in strategy statements; to ensure appropriate, regular\u00a0engagement with NGOs representing migrant groups; and to provide intercultural awareness training.  <\/p><p>It includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.\u00a0 It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund, which I launched earlier this year, which has provided funding for 131 initiatives by community organisations aimed at promoting migrant integration and facilitating social inclusion at the local level.<\/p><p>The strategy is available on the website of the Office for Promotion for Migrant Integration at .  <\/p><p>With regard to refugees and asylum seekers arriving under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, a specific programme of supports is put in place to assist their integration into Irish society.\u00a0 A personal\u00a0needs assessment is undertaken\u00a0by IRPP officials prior to the person's arrival in the State.\u00a0 Language\u00a0training and other orientation supports\u00a0are provided in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to facilitate the person's integration.\u00a0\u00a0Funding is also provided to local authorities\u00a0to recruit resettlement support workers and intercultural workers to support the integration process for these refugees for 12-18 months following their resettlement or relocation into the local community.\u00a0\u00a0This funding comes through\u00a0grants supported by the\u00a0EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":549,"content":"<p>Question No.  234 answered with Question No.  227.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Procedures","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[41536\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300068#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the procedures in place when a member of the public is arrested and taken into Garda custody; and if a person in custody suffers from serious ill health and displays symptoms of same in custody, the protocol that to ensure duty of care.","asker":"1329","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>The treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations is governed by the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Stations) Regulations, 1987.

This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This was superseded by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which allows for Syrians and other eligible nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection status in Ireland in their own right including all the rights and privileges that that entails.  This is a much-improved programme allowing vulnerable people to benefit from protection here.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland committed to accept approximately 1,040 refugees by the end of 2017 under the resettlement strand of the Programme and this commitment is on track with 785 people already in the State and the remaining 270 people due in early 2018 from Lebanon.  Furthermore, I announced on 15 September last that Ireland\u00a0would pledge to accept 600 programme refugees in 2018.  This commitment has been made as part of a new EU Commission and UNHCR resettlement pledging exercise under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, for the period 9 December 2017 to 31 December 2018.  Since the conclusion of this pledging exercise, the Commission issued a Resettlement Recommendation on 27 September, which calls for the resettlement of 50,000 refugees between December of this year and the end of October 2019.  Member states, like Ireland, who have already made pledges are being encouraged to consider increasing their pledges for the new two-year timeframe of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Relocation Strand of the Programme, we will have admitted our full cohort from Greece (1,089) by early 2018.  Relocation from Italy has not been possible within the two-year timeframe of the programme due to a refusal by Italy to allow law enforcement officers from other Member States to conduct security assessments of relocation candidates on its soil.  Our efforts to resolve this issue are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  I fully intend to honour our commitment under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.\u00a0While the relocation strand has not yielded the expected numbers,\u00a0together with my Department officials, I have been examining potential new pathways for people in need of protection following the conclusion of the EU programmes.

This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It was agreed at that time by both sides, the official side and the Garda representative associations and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance, that the new arrangements should apply to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving on, or after, 1 October 1976. By extension these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to that date. Generally speaking, these Agreed Reports provide that a Garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have superannuation benefits accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal, preserved until the member reached 60 years of age.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Similar arrangements have also been introduced in pension schemes across the public sector with varying &lsquo;cut-off&rsquo; dates depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests. <\/p>  <p>  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed.

Typically, sponsors commit to providing financial, emotional and resettlement support to help newly arrived refugees integrate into life in a new country.\u00a0 Such a model could enable willing community groups to become directly involved in supporting the resettlement of refugees fleeing conflict and in need of protection in Ireland. It could potentially encourage innovation in resettlement and promote positive resettlement outcomes, both for the resettled families and local communities.\u00a0 Officials in the IRPP are in active communication with colleagues in Canada with a view to examining how their programme works and drawing on any lessons that can be learned. <\/p>  <p>  IRPP have already had meetings, both in Ireland and overseas, with other States such as Canada and the UK as well as NGO and institutional actors\u00a0who are undertaking or involved with resettlement and private\/community sponsorship initiatives.\u00a0 The IRPP are examining the success of the Canadian Government's Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program and the progress of the recently introduced UK Community Sponsorship scheme; as evidence has shown that such programmes can build powerful bonds between sponsors and refugees, strengthen host communities; and foster positive attitudes towards refugees and resettlement.\u00a0 As the Deputy knows,\u00a0integration, a core aspect of resettlement, is a whole of society activity and not just one for Government.<\/p>  <p>  However, it must be noted that Community Sponsorship is a significant undertaking for sponsors and the commitment and resilience organisations will need to show to ensure that all the wide range of needs of these very vulnerable persons are met in a timely and effective manner should not be underestimated.\u00a0 Private sponsorship also requires considerable State oversight and related resources to be in place for it to work.\u00a0 Any such model will have to make clear the respective roles of State actors and civil society sponsors and if such a model is to be developed and deployed in Ireland then it must be adjusted to and suitable for the circumstances prevailing in Ireland. So there is quite an amount of work to be done before all of these elements are in place.<\/p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that community sponsorship is only likely to account for a relatively small proportion of resettlement refugees.\u00a0 However, I believe that private sponsorship can take many forms and active engagement in this area could succeed in activating the community component of resettlement and integration much more powerfully and allow the development of structured pathways to allow people to engage with refugees and migrants - in other words the creation of pathways for the expression of community altruism and solidarity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have made it very clear in all my meetings with NGOs who are interested in developing such a model that both I and my official in the IRPP are willing to work with them towards the development of a viable Community Sponsorship model. It is my belief that such a model will emerge in time and I am very happy to support its development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[41799\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to reintroduce the Syrian humanitarian admission programme to expand Ireland's capacity to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis; the reason he would or would not reintroduce such a programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>Before the migration crisis escalated, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Alan Shatter, T.D. introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admissions Programme (SHAP), which was subject to certain conditions, including economic dependency being met by the sponsor. This was superseded by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which allows for Syrians and other eligible nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection status in Ireland in their own right including all the rights and privileges that that entails. This is a much improved programme allowing vulnerable people to benefit from protection here. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland committed to accept approximately 1,040 refugees by the end of 2017 under the resettlement strand of the Programme and this commitment is on track with 785 people already in the State and the remaining 270 people due in early 2018 from Lebanon. Furthermore, I announced on 15 September last that Ireland\u00a0would pledge to accept 600 programme refugees in 2018. This commitment has been made as part of a new EU Commission and UNHCR resettlement pledging exercise under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, for the period 09 December 2017 &ndash; 31 December 2018. Since the conclusion of this pledging exercise, the Commission issued a Resettlement Recommendation on 27 September, which calls for the resettlement of 50,000 refugees between December of this year and the end of October 2019. Member States, like Ireland, who have already made pledges are being encouraged to consider increasing their pledges for the new two-year timeframe of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Relocation Strand of the Programme, we will have admitted our full cohort from Greece (1,089) by early 2018. Relocation from Italy has not been possible within the two-year timeframe of the programme due to a refusal by Italy to allow law enforcement officers from other Member States to conduct security assessments of relocation candidates on its soil. Our efforts to resolve this issue are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  I fully intend to honour our commitment under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.\u00a0While the relocation strand has not yielded the expected numbers,\u00a0together with my Department officials, I have been examining potential new pathways for people in need of protection following the conclusion of the EU programmes. One possibility is through family reunification, for which I intend to bring forward fresh proposals in the near future. Such a programme would concentrate efforts on reunification of immediate family members specifically caught up in conflict zones, and would be in addition to those eligible under the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[41800\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of extra funding being allocated to local authorities in advance of the Syrian resettlement programme; the areas to which funding is being allocated, for example, housing, English classes, rural development and community development by year and local authority, in tabular form; if this funding is coming from the European integration fund or another body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[41801\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if extra funding is being provided to community groups in areas in which Syrian refugees are being resettled under the Syrian resettlement programme; the number of months in advance of and after the arrival of refugees funding is being allocated; the breakdown of funding by year, name of community group, type of community activity and local authority area, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[41806\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300069#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department has engaged with community groups on the ground in local authority areas in preparation for the Syrian resettlement programme, refugee protection programme and other departmental programmes dealing with the Syrian refugee crisis; if his Department or local authorities are being encouraged to engage with community groups; if so, the means or resources through which it is engaging; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 256, 257 and 260 together.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at the local level, with support from the IRPP.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing\u00a0apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The expectation is that this work will be concluded in the coming weeks, and that Minister Murphy will be considering the potential of new initiatives in relation to affordable housing in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of respite care in the context of disability services, there are a number of factors impacting on capacity.  A significant number of respite beds have to be utilised where admission is unplanned leading to the number of available respite nights being down against planned activity.  In addition, within the regulatory and policy context, the manner in which residential and respite services is provided has also changed, as Agencies comply with regulatory standards.  Capacity has generally decreased with requirements for personal and appropriate space.  In some situations beds are no longer available.  For instance, they may be vacated by residents who go home at weekends or for holidays and can no longer be used for respite.  Implementation of the national policy on congregated settings is also affecting available capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 6,320 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services totalling 182,506 overnights.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it&rsquo;s planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family.  It is also planned that based on existing levels of service, a further 41,100 day only respite sessions will be accessed by people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.  This marks a significant change in the way that respite services are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Eligibility","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[41549\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the mobility allowance was stopped for new applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>Conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Scheme in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes in February 2013.<\/p><p>The Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments that support choice and independence.

It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A. to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme and I hope to be able to clarify proposed changes before the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN05600"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[41957\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300070#WRN05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of breaches of labelling that have been identified throughout the food sector in the past 12 months in respect of imports and home produced product; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>Data regarding breaches of food labelling requirements is compiled by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).

Funding of &euro;1.69 billion was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) for disability services in 2017. This represented an increased allocation of &euro;130 million compared to the previous year. <\/p>  <p>  In the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 6,320 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services totalling 182,506 overnights. Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it&rsquo;s planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family. It is also planned that based on existing levels of service, a further 41,100 day only respite sessions will be accessed by people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated. This marks a significant change in the way that respite services are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines, is a key objective of the Irish health service. However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes - primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness, Drugs Payment as well as the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; including fees and ingredient costs, is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. To ensure that patients receive the highest quality care, it is essential that the resources invested in medicines are used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, to deliver greater efficiencies across the supply chain and also to promote the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>In 2013, the HSE established the Medicines Management Programme (MMP). It is headed by the (NMIC) and the (NCPE) in collaboration with the (HSE-PCRS) and provides sustained national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and the cost effective provision of medicines in Ireland. <\/p><p>The Medicines Management Programme has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing evidence-based and cost-effective prescribing nationally and the review of Versatis is an example of this. <\/p><p>Versatis 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.<\/p><p>Following a review by the MMP of the evidence available to support the use of Versatis, the HSE has introduced a new system for the reimbursement of Versatis from the 1 September 2017. This process will support the appropriate use of this medication while ensuring that those with an indication of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) continue to have access to this treatment. The HSE estimate that this new protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>The product has been reimbursed under the community drugs schemes in Ireland since 2010. Initially, the projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication. However, total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, due primarily to off-license use i.e. prescribing Versatis as a general treatment for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, there are over 25,000 patients in receipt of this item. The MMP prescribing and cost guidance report highlighted that the clinical evidence to support the use of Versatis 5% medicated plaster for PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. <\/p><p>The NCPE estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of the prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>All patients who currently receive antivirals for shingles, or patients who are prescribed antivirals for the treatment of shingles by their GP in the future, will automatically be approved for Versatis for a period of three months. No action is required by the GP in this instance and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy will be notified in real time of the patient&rsquo;s approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who are currently initiated on Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for a period of three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until the 30th November 2017.<\/p><p>From the 1st December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer be dispensed Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced patient information leaflets and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be dispensed for unlicensed indications. In such circumstance, the GP will be required to make an application for reimbursement for unlicensed indications for new and existing patients through the online system.<\/p><p>Where the application is under exceptional circumstances, the application will be reviewed by the MMP before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review of Versatis are available on the HSE website at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[41305\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether it is cost effective to place a person (details supplied) in a nursing home when a home care package would suffice in meeting their care needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[41306\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300072#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of applications that have been received in the past year by the HSE from persons seeking a licence to use medicinal cannabis products here; the number of these applications that were granted; and the criteria that were used in accepting or rejecting applications","asker":"1432","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that cannabis is listed in Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations which means that it is subject to the strictest level of control; however, under the Misuse of Drugs legislation it is open to me as Minister for Health to consider granting a licence to an Irish-registered medical practitioner for access to medical cannabis for a named patient.<\/p><p>The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to my Department, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  <\/p><p>A licence application endorsed by the patient&rsquo;s medical consultant and submitted under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, use must include:<\/p><p>- an outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a cannabis-based product;<\/p><p>- details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient;<\/p><p>- the source of the cannabis-based product; and<\/p><p>- arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has been initiated.<\/p><p>To date a valid licence application has been received by my Department in relation to one patient.

Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.

The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc. All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.

Under the Health (In-Patients Charges) (Amendment) Regulations 2008, a person who has been referred to a hospital for an in-patient service, including that provided on a day case basis, will have to pay the statutory daily charge, currently &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 per year.

I expect that the issue of venesection services for patients with haemochromatosis will be considered in the context of the overall GP contract review process.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the Irish Blood Transfusion (IBTS) has been running a haemochromatosis clinic in the Stillorgan Blood Donation Clinic since 2007 and sees approximately 600 patients annually who are eligible to donate blood.

These clinics provide venesection at no cost to the patient with a prescription from their treating clinician.

More children and adults are now seeking access to respite and the &ldquo;changing needs&rdquo; of people with a disability are also having an impact, as they, along with the rest of the population, live longer lives.  The Programme for Partnership Government recognises the need for respite services to be developed further and I am committed to ensuring that this happens.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of factors impacting on respite capacity.  A significant number of respite beds are regularly utilised to allow unplanned emergency admissions, leading to the number of available respite nights being down against planned activity.  The regulatory and policy context has also changed the manner in which residential and respite services is provided, as Agencies comply with regulatory standards.  Capacity has generally decreased with requirements for personal and appropriate space.  Beds can no longer be used for respite where residents go home at weekends or for holidays.  Implementation of the national policy on congregated settings is also reducing available capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In the HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 6,320 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services totalling 182,506 overnights.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it&rsquo;s planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family.  Furthermore,  the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.  This marks a significant change in the way that respite services are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent available data from the HSE indicates that 81,836 overnight respite sessions were accessed in the first six months of this year, compared to 90,861 in the first six months of 2016.

This model aims to ensure that the rheumatology patient is seen, assessed and treated by the right person, in the right place and in the timeliest manner.  For this reason, the Programme welcomes stakeholder feedback and comments from patients, their families and patient support groups all of which are taken into consideration in its service design.<\/p>  <p>  The Model of Care for Rheumatology recommends minimal staffing standards, based on population, for each department in order to provide appropriate treatment to patients with rheumatological diseases.  Publication of this model of care is a priority for the NCPR as it will shape the overall treatment and management of all musculoskeletal disorders.<\/p>  <p>  Based on this model of care, the NCPR plans to develop disease specific pathways for all rheumatological disease groups which will include Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome as part of hypermobility diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The most common form of EDS is hypermobility of the joints and requires management by physiotherapy and primary care but does not usually need specialist input.  The most severe and very specialist cases are rare (1 per 100,000 live births) and are usually managed by paediatric rheumatologists based at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC). Based on these figures the total number of patients with severe EDS is likely to be in the order of 20-40 patients nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPR have identified the need for additional Consultant Rheumatologists and multidisciplinary team staff at OLCHC to improve access to paediatric rheumatology services for all children with musculoskeletal disease.  This will provide a means to deliver improved care for EDS sufferers.<\/p>  <p>  The Paediatric Consultant Rheumatologists in Ireland based at OLCHC have specialist training in the management of all types of rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.  They are supported by a multidisciplinary team and have access to other relevant consultant specialists needed for the care of EDS sufferers.<\/p>  <p>  Adult rheumatologists are also trained in the diagnosis and management of EDS and care for adults with EDS. EDS education is part of continuing medical education meeting curricula, attended by adult rheumatologists and EDS update was the subject of a full lecture at the 2015 meeting of the Irish Society of Rheumatology although education and awareness on diagnosis and treatment of hypermobility disorders could be further improved at primary care level.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that the HSE&rsquo;s musculoskeletal physiotherapy initiative has proven to be one of the most successful service improvement initiatives coupled with recent increase in nursing staff, there is still a bottleneck in terms of access for those in need of a Consultant review.  This is due to the current deficit in consultant numbers which has a significant impact on service availability demonstrated by the all-time high waiting list despite the novel initiatives in place.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the NCPR are of the opinion that the need is not for a specialist clinician in the Dublin region to treat EDS rather, an increase in Consultant Rheumatologists nationally which will ensure that the national population can access the service seeing the right person at the right place at the right time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300076#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rare Diseases Strategy","counter":973,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300076#WRT03600"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[41576\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300076#WRT03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is provided for within the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014-2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>A &lsquo;rare disease&rsquo; is defined in Europe as a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease affecting no more than 5 people per 10,000.

This is in the context of an overall decrease in the numbers who smoke tobacco products  in Ireland in recent years.<\/p><p>The Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 to 2015 do not prohibit the sale of the roll-your-own tobacco &quot;combi boxes&quot; referred to by the Deputy.  However, a number of measures have been introduced aimed at having a positive public health impact on the numbers of people smoking roll-your-own tobacco.  The EU Tobacco Products Directive came into force in 2014 and was transposed into Irish legislation in 2016.  Under that legislation the sale of roll-your-own tobacco packs weighing less than 30g is prohibited.  Prior to this roll-your-own tobacco could be purchased in 12.5g and 25g packets.  This increase in the size of the packet has the effect of making roll-your-own tobacco less affordable than before, particularly to younger adults.  Evidence indicates that pricing is a key means of reducing tobacco consumption.  Government Policy, <i>Tobacco Free Ireland<\/i>, contains recommendations in relation to raising taxes on tobacco products including reducing the price differential between roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes.  In the context of Budget 2018, my colleague, Minister Harris has recently written to Minister Pascal Donohue TD requesting that consideration be given to increasing the excise duty on tobacco products generally and, in particular, to increasing the excise duty on roll-your-own tobacco so as to reduce the price differential between roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes.<\/p><p>Irish legislation which came into force on 30 September 2017 provides that all retail packaging of tobacco products manufactured from that date must be in standardised packaging.  The aim of standardised packaging is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive, make health warnings more prominent and prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco.  In relation to the health warnings the EU Tobacco Products Directive had the effect of significantly increasing the size of the picture health warnings on tobacco packaging.<\/p><p>It is anticipated that these and other tobacco control, cessation and health promotion measures will continue to reduce the numbers smoking tobacco.

A further &euro;0.987m was allocated under the 2016 Service Plan for Orthopaedics and Trauma to continue the development of paediatric scoliosis services in Crumlin hospital.  The HSE Winter Initiative 2016\/2017 also included &euro;2m specifically for scoliosis.  In addition, capital funding was provided for a new orthopaedic theatre in Crumlin which is now operational.  The Children's Hospital Group Operations Plan for both 2016 and 2017 prioritised the improvement of capacity of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing deficits and waiting lists.  It is acknowledged that paediatric orthopaedic services, including scoliosis, will require additional investment in the next few years to further improve access for children requiring elective or trauma orthopaedic services, and to build up the orthopaedic work force for the new children's hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's Business Priorities for this year include the overseeing of plans to tackle waiting lists overall.  The Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 commits to sustaining the progress made to date on waiting lists, and it has been made clear that one of this Government's key priorities is to reduce waiting times for the longest waiting patients.  Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In this regard, I would like to highlight that up to the end of August 2017, 202 scoliosis procedures have been carried out in the two children's hospitals (Crumlin and Temple Street), as compared with 142 in those hospitals in the same period in 2016, representing a 42% increase in activity by end of August between 2016 and 2017.

It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework. Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them. It also aims to:<\/p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators;<\/p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public;<\/p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.<\/p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups. These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.<\/p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. <\/p>  <p>   Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and I expect that proposals around the management of chronic diseases are being discussed in this context.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the discussions taking place are wide ranging and ambitious in their scope. I think it is important to acknowledge that, as with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, these engagements take time.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to comment on progress to date.  I look forward to continued ongoing positive engagement with GP representatives in the months ahead. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices. Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300079#WRW03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":1145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300079#WRW03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1146,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[41937\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300079#WRW03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which he will ensure that the high cost of preventive medication will not be a barrier in effectively controlling asthma under the long-term illness scheme or another targeted scheme such as a chronic disease card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1147,"content":"<p>Asthma is not covered on the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme.

Sprat is a short-lived species\u00a0and an important prey fish\u00a0for many marine species thus vital to the ocean food chain as well as an important source of income for inshore fishermen.  <\/p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.  Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of the seabirds and marine life around our coast through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments.  <\/p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is\u00a0not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation. Scientifically, relatively little is known about the sprat species.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES)\u00a0considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock.  <\/p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.  The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.  That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry,\u00a0commenced in October 2014 and is now\u00a0in its final stage, under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with\u00a0the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  <\/p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem.  This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute advise that they will also participate in an observer scheme where they will\u00a0work closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage on any sprat fishery that is taking place.  The purpose of the observer scheme is twofold:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, ie herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of\u00a0protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that these projects\/observer schemes\u00a0will allow for more intensive data collection and enhanced scientific knowledge on the sprat stock\u00a0thus\u00a0supporting any future management actions considered necessary including the issue of pair trawling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[41940\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he can assist those exporters in the food sector that have been negatively affected by issues associated with Brexit with particular reference to access to the UK market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that Brexit poses enormous challenges for the agri food sector by virtue of its reliance on the UK market.

In the same year we also got access to the Canadian market for Irish beef and to the Omani market for Irish beef and sheepmeat.  In 2016 we gained access to the Maldives for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat.  We also gained access to the Iranian market for sheepmeat and we regained access to the Israeli market for beef.  In 2017, the market in Egypt was re-opened to exports of beef from Ireland and we got access to the Chilean market for Irish pork.  <\/p>  <p>  On the dairy front, Ireland exported in the region of &euro;4bn in dairy products to approaching 130 countries in 2016.  Against the backdrop of EU agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, which will obviously have benefit for the sector, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new\u00a03rd country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products.  In many instances such efforts are on foot of trade missions at Ministerial level.  In addition, against the background of Brexit, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct market profiling exercise to identify opportunities in new and more mature markets, and the output of this exercise will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.  <\/p>  <p>  CSO data for the year to end June showed that Irish dairy exports were approaching 20% ahead of the same period in 2016, on foot of factors such as\u00a0improving global prices, particularly evident in sectors such as butter, but also increases in volumes exported also across a range of product categories.  This demonstrates that our aforementioned efforts are contributing positively to Irish dairy sector exports.  <\/p>  <p>  This however does not reflect the increased growth in exports to the following markets:<\/p>  <p>  The value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2016.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 52% in the period 2012 to 2016.  Exports to these markets now account for 19% of total food and drink exports compared to 16% in 2012.  This growth in share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 23%.  <\/p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 150% to &euro;1.2bn, and\u00a0led by China, which recorded a more than three-fold increase (Total &euro;880m v &euro;283m in 2012).  Exports to other Asian markets grew by 73% in the same period to &euro;318 million.  <\/p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has maintained around the &euro;500m during this period notwithstanding the challenges faced by those West African countries whose economies are so reliant on a strong international oil price.  Encouragingly, exports to North African countries grew by just under 50% in 5 years helping to counterbalance this impact.  <\/p>  <p>  Exports to the Middle East grew by 21%, to &euro;370 million.  <\/p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.

The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.  The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.  <\/p>  <p>  The main features of the policy involve:\u00a0 setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020; a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in over the period 2015 to 2019; and the establishment of a regional decision making arrangement.  <\/p>  <p>  A key element of the CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  Fishing opportunities for each Member State are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice.  The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest.  This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  <\/p>  <p>  The landing obligation (also referred to as the &lsquo;discards ban&rsquo;) was also introduced as part of the current CFP.  Its objective is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding.  The reform is being rolled out in a practical and phased manner. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1st of January 2015.  The landing obligation was extended to certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) from the 1st of January 2016 and will be fully phased in by the 1st January 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.

The EU Commission has also noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continue to improve which indicates that we are seeing the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices.  <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress that will ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[41945\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which fish stocks have fluctuated in the past five years; the degree to which this affects the catch; his plans for the future in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.

Growth trends in the poultry sector indicate a continued trajectory of sustained, steady growth, consistent with previous years.  <\/p>  <p>  Strong consumer demand for Irish poultry meat and eggs has led to a steady increase in domestic production.  Overall, poultry meat production for 2016 increased by approximately 14.6% year on year to c. 92 million birds, with industry expecting production to exceed over 100 million birds this year.  Egg production also continues to rise, driven by recent growth in egg consumption, largely attributable to the fact that eggs are perceived as a healthy food due to their protein content.  Domestic production of shell eggs grew by 3.5% last year, with average consumption per person up c. 4%. Imports declined by 27% with exports up 6% reflecting strong growth.  <\/p>  <p>  The poultry sector remains very competitive, and given that Ireland is over 100% self-sufficient in poultry meat and egg production it is important to have the edge provided by Bord Bia's Quality Assurance Scheme.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.  The long-term average cereal production in Ireland is in the region of 2.2 million tonnes per annum and it is desirable to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2017 harvest is estimated by Teagasc to be in the region of 2.1 million tonnes, despite a decrease in the area devoted to tillage.  This is mainly due to the availability of new improved varieties capable of higher yields and thereby helping to sustain a viable tillage sector.  Cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand and volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.  I nonetheless acknowledge the continued tight margins experienced by growers and the challenges facing the sector, as global production due to higher yields continues to outstrip demand.  The Deputy will be aware of a number of ongoing measures I introduced in this regard to sustain the tillage sector and promote its growth in the future.  Among these measures was a targeted crop loss support measure to assist growers most affected by the wet weather harvest conditions of September 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this measure I also introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  I have been advised by the banks that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  <\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I also introduced the\u00a0Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II earlier this year.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The second tranche is open until 6th October 2017.  There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure particularly in relation to precision equipment to improve profitability at farm level with a total number of 490 applications received in the first tranche for the tillage sector alone.  450 approvals have now issued in respect of the first tranche and payments and approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the 'Stimulus' competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":1224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1225,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[41949\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300080#WRX05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the dairy industry has stabilised and expanded following the abolition of quotas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1226,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the milk quota regime in 2015, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by all concerned as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  The ending of milk quota regime represented an exceptional opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and reach the 50% target set out in Food Harvest 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The previous two years were extremely challenging in the dairy sector.  Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 and 2016\u00a0included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side.  While the outlook in 2017 has been more positive, there\u00a0are a number of factors which\u00a0continue to contribute to price volatility in the sector, including political factors outside our control.  Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from\u00a0expanding global demand.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of market returns to primary producers, raw milk prices remain in the region of 35 to 36 cents per litre\u00a0which is ahead of the EU average and over 50% ahead of where\u00a0prices were\u00a0this time last year.  Peak production months have passed in Ireland and by end September circa 80% plus of the average dairy farmer's annual production has been completed.  This combination of good prices and stronger supply means that 2017 can be expected to be a very good year for Irish dairy farmers in terms of market returns for their raw milk, which is welcome in the context of a very difficult 2016 in particular.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor the market and provide support to the sector through Rural Development Schemes such as TAMS, and by providing funding to bodies such as Teagasc, AHI and ICBF to improve efficiency at farm level.

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK's decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I have initiated a number of very important steps including the introduction of a seven point plan to increase international market access for Irish food and drink exports.  The plan operates with significant input from Bord Bia and Irish Embassies around the world, to help increase the footprint of our food and drink exports.  <\/p>  <p>  It is critical at this time to work towards diversifying market outlets for our agri products, while at the same time retaining access to the critically important UK market.  To that end, I have supported Bord Bia's marketing strategy by initially allocating &euro;3.6m for market work in 2016 and 2017 and more recently by allocating a further &euro;6.7m to support a market prioritisation exercise and a range of strategic marketing and promotion activities.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to retain the hard won markets within the UK, I have met with the CEOs of the major UK retailers to impress upon Ireland's continued commitment to meeting the requirements of UK retailers and consumers.

The sector accounts for 7.8% of Gross Agricultural Output and is the third largest individual component.  In 2016 Irish pigmeat exports were 4% higher at &euro;615m. Exports of Irish pigmeat to international markets however grew by 20% driven by higher demand from Asia.  Irish prices are currently strong and remain broadly in line with EU prices, reflecting continued market confidence in Europe and strong demand in China, the second most important market for Irish pigmeat.<\/p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the development of the pigmeat sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision throughout the whole RDP for a specific Pigs and Poultry Investment Scheme with a budget of &euro;17 million.  Other supports for development of the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility, courses in pig production, knowledge transfer programme and the provision of technical advice plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Teagasc is currently planning a pilot project to apply LEAN based principles at primary production level which would help to improve competitiveness of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities and the quality assurance schemes which help consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat produce on the domestic market.  Support from Bord Bia also helps expand the presence of Irish exports on EU and third country markets, which is evident from the continued rise in exports, particularly to Asia.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced further funding of &euro;6.745 million for Bord Bia to undertake a programme of additional activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  This in addition to a number of recent initiatives including the re-configuration of the market access effort within my Department and the provision of additional resources for this purpose, the development of a new portal website which will bring together in the one location the full range of open markets and products, the relevant conditions of certification in a user-friendly manner for exporters, and a programme of trade missions to provide an opportunity to Irish exporters to develop a market profile and\u00a0 presence in third countries.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish pigmeat sector to ensure the continuation of positive prospects for future growth.  Securing access for Irish products and increasing penetration in international markets is a priority against the background of Brexit.  There have been a number of significant successes in recent times and agri food exports to China, for example, have almost tripled in value to more than &euro;700 million since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, threats from significant diseases such as African swine fever are monitored continuously, and the industry is updated with disease alerts when outbreaks occur in nearby countries, or countries with relevant links to the Irish pig industry.

This exercise, which should take account of other review\/reform programmes of relevance, including in relation to local government, could be particularly useful in supporting the effort to address infringements of EU environmental legislation where, although significant improvements have been achieved in recent years, considerable further work remains to be done, work which must continue to be accorded the highest possible priority. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>Issues are being addressed as they arise, for instance in the context of ongoing reform of the Local Government sector and the establishment of Irish Water, which will result in improved environmental governance. <br \/><br \/>A review of environmental governance would be a valuable exercise. However, such a review would require concentrated engagement by a range of stakeholders, Government Departments, Local Authorities and other public bodies over a considerable period, to ensure a thorough and wide-ranging review. <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.1.3 The proposed wider review of environmental governance would also be the most appropriate context in which to consider whether a specialist Environment Court\/Tribunal and\/or a system of administrative sanctions should be put in place (taking into account the experience of such systems recently introduced in England and Wales) and if so, what form such mechanisms and measures might take. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>The then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government\u00a0in 2014 undertook a public consultation process regarding implementing Article 9 of the Aarhus Convention. This consultation sought to initiate discussion on a review of domestic provisions implementing Article 9 with a view to improving clarity and ensuring on-going effectiveness of the implementing measures. This consultation provided an opportunity for all to input into the process of further enhancing the legislation including consideration on whether mechanisms such as a specialist Environmental Court\/Tribunal\/Administrative Sanctions etc. should be put in place. Due to the complex challenges involved, it is not proposed to proceed with any such initiative. <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.1 The EPA, in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action in individual cases, should always take into account the strong deterrent effect of prosecutions and should pursue the prosecution route to optimum effect. <\/td><td>As part of its enforcement policy, the EPA considers and uses a range of enforcement tools including issuing non-compliances to formal enforcement processes such as prosecutions. Details of prosecutions taken by the EPA are published on the EPA website www.epa.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.2 There is a strong case for the EPA&rsquo;s licensing process to include formal requirements in relation to Health Impact Assessment. The proposed Advisory Committee on the interface between the environment and human health (Recommendation 7.2.7) should, as a matter of priority, make urgent recommendations about the most appropriate way to address this issue. This Committee should also assess and make recommendations in respect of the inclusion of health factors in risk assessment for prioritising enforcement. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>The new EIA Directive (2014\/52\/EU) requires that, as part of the assessment to be carried out when undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment, consideration must be given to the likely significant impacts on &ldquo;&hellip;human health and populations&hellip;&rdquo;. In preparation for the transposition and implementation of the new Directive, the EPA has set up a Working Group, whose purpose is to develop a methodology to be followed by regulators who perform EIA, to ensure that relevant impacts related to human health and populations will be included in the assessment process. This will not constitute the formal Health Impact Assessment (HIA) process, but will, in line with advice from the EU Commission, incorporate the likely impacts associated with the emissions from the activity to be permitted. The implementation of the EIA Directive in Ireland is being led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is preparing any necessary regulatory changes. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.3 While due regard should be given to the interests of SMEs and smaller agricultural units, the level of EPA licence fees should be routinely reviewed and the Group notes that these are due for upward revision. <\/td><td>The EPA fee structure was reviewed in late 2012. On the basis of that review, a number of provisions were included in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 to provide for new licence fee categories.<br \/><br \/>It should be noted that the level of EPA licence application fees are set in statute by the Oireachtas.<br \/><br \/>There are no plans at this time to further review EPA licence fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.4 Currently, the EPA is restricted in its power to review part of an IPPC licence. Where this will not compromise environmental protection, and subject to appropriate public participation, the EPA should be given the power to undertake partial reviews of existing licences (see also 7.6.10).<\/td><td>The EPA has collaborated with the Department of the Environment and other interested parties, including legal experts and IBEC representatives, to examine the feasibility of legislating for a limited review procedure for EPA licences. To date, there is no clear line-of-sight to a legal basis for the carrying out of such limited reviews, and the possibility of such limited reviews is contingent upon new primary and secondary legislation. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.5 The EPA should be allowed greater access to the past records of licence applicants generally through a strengthening of relevant legislative provisions. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>All documentation related to the making of an application to the EPA for any licence, permit, consent or authorisation, is available on the EPA website. In relatively rare circumstances, confidential information of a very sensitive nature is not posted to the EPA web pages, but such withholding of information is very much the exception. Since 2004, the EPA has made its application documentation available to the public, on-line.\u00a0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.3.8 In order to facilitate greater public participation in licensing matters generally, the legislative framework should make provision for experts to give evidence via video-conferencing. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>There are no proposals at this time, but provision for experts to give evidence via video-conferencing may be considered in future legislative provisions. <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.2 Sections 52(1) and (2) of the 1992 Act should be revised and updated in light of the EPA&rsquo;s expanded remit and the principles underlying contemporary environmental regulation and should include specific references to the EPA&rsquo;s responsibilities in respect of water protection, climate change and its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>This is acted on, as appropriate, on a case by case basis as need arises. (See 7.6.1). Under the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the functions formerly performed by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) are now performed by the EPA since 1 August 2014.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.3 The EPA&rsquo;s absolute statutory immunity should be revised. <\/td><td>A number of other state agencies currently have statutory immunity, including the Health and Safety Authority and the National Asset Management Agency, which was provided for under legislation as recently as 2009. It will be particularly important to examine the potential impact of any change in this provision on the ability of the EPA effectively to discharge its statutory functions. Such change could set a precedent for other State agencies and, therefore, could not be considered in isolation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.4 The EPA should be subject to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction in respect of alleged maladministration. Appropriate resources must be made available to the Office of the Ombudsman to enable it to deal effectively with any significant increase in its workload that may arise. <\/td><td>In respect of the EPA falling within the remit of the Ombudsman&lsquo;s jurisdiction, the EPA Review Group recommended that it should do so in respect of issues of maladministration only. In the context of the drafting of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, the\u00a0then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government\u00a0engaged extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Attorney General on this issue in order to achieve an acceptable legislative wording to enable administrative procedures fall within the legislation, but excluding the quasi-judicial functions of the EPA. A satisfactory form of wording was not finalised and the EPA remains an exempt Agency for the purposes of the Act. <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.5 The rules governing legal costs in certain environmental litigation (section 50B Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended) should be kept under review. Concerns about access to environmental justice should be examined in the context of a wider review of environmental governance. <\/td><td>It is noted that the rules governing legal costs under Section 50B of the Planning and Development Acts as amended now apply i.e. that each party bears its own costs in judicial review proceedings of any decision\/action\/failure to take action to a law pursuant to a law of the State that gives effect to the EIA Directive, SEA Directive and the IPPC Directive. As case law on the 2011 cost rules evolves, the rules are kept under review, in conjunction with relevant case law from the CJEU (Courts of Justice, European Union). Any proposed amendments will be subject to a broad public consultation process, as appropriate. <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.9 Current legislation relating to contaminated land should be reviewed to develop a coherent, dedicated legal regime to address the various challenges that arise in this context, including guaranteeing that site operators make provision to meet any liabilities arising from their activities. Regulatory bodies should also ensure that sufficient controls are in place to avoid and militate against such situations arising. <\/td><td>Following the review of previous arrangements, the EPA published Guidance on the Management of Contaminated Land and Groundwater at EPA Licensed Sites in July 2013. <br \/><br \/>Following a public consultation in 2013, updated Guidance on Assessing and Costing Environmental Liabilities was published by the EPA in 2014. <br \/><br \/>The EPA has a programme in place to ensure that licensed sites make financial provision for future liabilities, closure and aftercare costs.\u00a0 To date, the EPA has secured &euro;500 million in financial provision from licensed sites and is prioritising sites with known closure and aftercare costs (such as landfills and mines) and sites with potential high liabilities in the event of an incident. <br \/><br \/>The EPA is also focussed on reducing risks and liabilities at licensed sites by ensuring remediation programmes are implemented at sites with significantly contaminated soil or groundwater.\u00a0 Using a risk based approach, the EPA&rsquo;s focus is on sites which pose a risk to human health, or which pose a threat to the achievement of the water framework directive objectives.    <br \/><br \/>While these measures significantly reduce the risk of the State having to cover the liabilities of sites in the event of abandonment, the EPA has recently begun discussions with\u00a0the department of Communications, Climate Action and Local Government\u00a0to put a framework in place for dealing with contaminated sites which fall to the state for clean-up.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.6.10 Consideration should be given to making provision for amendments to IPPC and waste licences in certain limited circumstances (beyond clerical and technical amendments) without the necessity for a full licence review. <\/td><td>The\u00a0then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government\u00a0initiated an examination of this proposal in conjunction with the EPA. It\u00a0found it\u00a0a difficult area to draw a balance\u00a0between an amendment\u00a0versus a review, without making the process arbitrary.

Further extensions of the gas networks in the county may be possible, but will be subject to assessment in accordance with the connections policy approved by the CRU. I understand that Kinnegad, Kilbeggan and Moate were assessed under the \"New Towns Analysis Phase 3\" report dated 9th April 2010, published by Gaslink, the predecessor of GNI, including on its website. This assessment found that these towns did not qualify for connection on economic grounds at that time. <\/p>  <p>  The question of whether network extensions should, where economically\u00a0feasible and in line with our energy policy goals in the White Paper, provide for the possibility of future connections in order\u00a0to contribute to regional and rural development needs to be addressed, in my view. \u00a0At the launch of the Action Plan for Rural Development I set out my view that there are communities partly or sometimes wholly excluded from basic criteria of modern convenience and comfort, in terms of communications, energy efficiency and fuel poverty. My long-standing position on the gas network is that\u00a0it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible. Accordingly, and against the backdrop of the energy policy White Paper, I commissioned a study on the wider costs and benefits of gas network extensions, to include possible climate and decarbonisation aspects, as well as regional and rural development benefits such as supporting rural centres.\u00a0Following the conclusion of a procurement process, my Department last week appointed a consultant through the Office of Government Procurement tendering process. The contract arrangements provide that the consultant will deliver a preliminary report by year-end 2017, in accordance with the tender requirements. <\/p>  <p>  This project involves a high-level study that will address issues relating to the wider decarbonisation, air quality, climate and emissions and regional and rural development benefits from additional network extensions. It is provided that particular account will be taken of, but not limited to, the following: wider economic and environmental costs\/benefits; economics and funding and; potential alternative uses for the network such as renewable gas and hydrogen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300081#WRY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300081#WRY05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[41717\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300081#WRY05400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when broadband services will be available under the national broadband scheme at a person's (details supplied) home.","asker":"1225","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) will ensure\u00a0high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0\u00a0The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included\u00a0in the State Intervention Area.

This Code, which has been adopted by Sport Ireland, is principles-based and has a framework which can help to assess how these organisations are progressing towards developing stronger governance practices.<\/p>  <p>  I hold the view that independent external board members are helpful for good corporate governance.\u00a0 In the case of large sporting organisations that receive significant public funding, I would encourage and expect them to consider appointing such persons to their boards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Testing","counter":1340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1341,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[41391\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1342,"content":"<p>The fee charged for commercial vehicle roadworthiness tests in the UK, France, Germany, Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction, as well as the content of such tests, is a matter for the relevant Ministries\/bodies charged with responsibility for such in each of these respective jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The prescribed fee, per class of vehicle, for commercial vehicle roadworthiness tests in Ireland is set out in the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Vehicle Testing)(No .2) Regulations 2013 (SI 347 of 2013).\u00a0 The fee covers the test undertaken at the testing centre, cost of the certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) and a road safety levy payable to the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in respect of an annual test.<\/p>  <p>  In this jurisdiction, the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (CVR) testing system is operated on a fully commercial basis and without any financial contribution from the State.\u00a0 This means that CVR tests are delivered by privately owned garages who are responsible for the provision of the necessary infrastructure and facilities and they carry the financial and operational risks associated with that investment. <\/p>  <p>  The road safety levy is being used to fund several aspects of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness reform programme which is intended to support safer roads and compliant operators.\u00a0 The RSA has financed the up-front capital investment associated with the reform programme to date.<\/p>  <p>  The model for commercial vehicle testing has been reviewed and it was decided by Government that the prevailing model involving the delivery of commercial testing by privately owned garages should continue.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test Regulations","counter":1343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1344,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[41392\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300082#WRZ05600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a person (details supplied) with a driving licence can avoid the obligation of taking a number of driving lessons before sitting a driving test; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1345,"content":"<p>Irish driver licensing law operates within a framework of EU law, which sets common standards of obtaining a licence for all Member States.

The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  In practice, there are a number of factors that make it impossible to be 100% precise regarding the cost of backdating the Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  For example, much of the data used in the operation of the scheme at present for periods from 1994, notably child benefit records, is not readily available in computerised form going back to 1973.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is clear that such a backdating would entail a significant and ongoing cost to the Social Insurance Fund.  It is estimated that backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 would cost some &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall rise in the cost of State pensions. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.  The average pension payments made by my Department to men and women over 66 years of age are within approximately 1% of each other.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the State Pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. Following completion of the current actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas. Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300085#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":1499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300085#WRCC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1500,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[41582\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300085#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the timeframe for the introduction of a universal pension scheme; her plans to phase in same over a number of budgets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1501,"content":"<p>I can confirm the Government will publish and commence the implementation of a pensions reform plan in the coming months.

Once identity is verified, a Public Services Card can be issued.  This is a physical token which proves that a person has had their identity verified to the SAFE 2 standard and enables them to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible. <\/p><p>The primary legislative provisions for SAFE registration and identity verification are set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended) as follows -<\/p><p>-  Sections 262 and 263B provide for the verification of identity for issuance and use of a PPS Number.<\/p><p>-  Sections 263, 263A and 263B provide for the verification of identity for issuance, use and cancellation of a PSC.<\/p><p>-  Section 241 provides that a person must satisfy the Minister as to his\/her identity when making a new claim and sets out how that can be done.<\/p><p>-  Section 247C provides that an existing claimant must satisfy the Minister as to his\/her identity, sets out how that can be done and provides for disqualification where an existing claimant fails to so do.  <\/p><p>The process used to satisfy the Minister as to identity is the SAFE 2 registration process.  The only data that is collected and verified in a SAFE 2 registration process is the limited set of data contained in the Public Services Identity (PSI) dataset which is defined in Section 262 (1) and listed at Section 262 (3) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  This essentially includes a person&rsquo;s PPS Number, surname; forename; date of birth; place of birth; sex; all former surnames (if any); all former surnames (if any) of his or her mother; address; nationality; photo; signature.  <\/p><p>Only bodies specified in legislation and currently included in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) or their agents can share this data or elements of it or can ask for and use the PSC.  The full list of specified bodies is contained in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  It lists all Ministers, city and county councils, Education and Training Boards, the HSE, voluntary hospitals, schools, institutes of technology, universities, and a range of civil and public service bodies.  Such specified bodies are in all cases required to process and store data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts.<\/p><p>The legislative basis for sharing this data is set out in Section 262 (6) of the Act and states &ldquo;where a specified body has a transaction with a person, the Minister may share the person&rsquo;s public service identity with the specified body to the extent necessary in respect of that transaction for authentication by the specified body of the person&rsquo;s public service identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;a specified body may use a person&rsquo;s public service identity in performing its public functions insofar as those functions relate to the person concerned.&rdquo;<\/p><p>My Department has been implementing SAFE 2 identity verification on a phased basis since 2011.  More recently, other public service bodies have begun implementing it for their services.  As a consequence, and in addition to services from my Department, SAFE 2 identity verification is now required for - <\/p><p>-  First time adult passport applicants in the state.<\/p><p>-  Replacement of lost, stolen or damaged passports issued prior to January 2005, where the person is resident in the State.<\/p><p>-  Citizenship applications.<\/p><p>-  Driver Theory Test Applicants.<\/p><p>-  Access to high value or personal online public services, e.g. Social Protection&rsquo;s MyWelfare and Revenue&rsquo;s MyAccount services.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 which lists a number of additional public services for which SAFE 2 registration will be required over the next 18 months or so, with others likely to be added over time.  That Strategy is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s dedicated website at <i>. <\/i>I have been informed by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that it is not mandatory for residents in Ireland to be SAFE 2 registered, though a growing number of public services that require proof of identity of individuals will be underpinned by the SAFE 2 standard, ensuring services are provided to the correct people in an efficient manner, while protecting their data.  The transition plans, including communications, interim arrangements, exceptions, etc., will be worked through by those Departments and public bodies with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":1531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1532,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[41737\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1533,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 16 August 2017.

My role as Minister with regard to development contributions is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Section 48(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides that a development contribution scheme, applied by a planning authority in respect of its functional area, may make provision for payment of different contributions in respect of different classes or descriptions of development.  The Act also requires that schemes state the basis for determining contributions and that they have regard to the actual estimated cost of providing the various classes of public infrastructure and facilities.  The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000\u00a0on the implementation of development contribution schemes.  Adherence to a consistent cost allocation methodology outlined in the guidelines is strongly recommended.  The guidelines further advise that, in deciding within the non-residential categories of development works how costs are to be attributed, the intensity of infrastructural usage by different categories of, for example, employment related activity should be taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of development contribution schemes adopted by planning authorities currently provide for charges in respect of certain agricultural buildings or development within their functional areas.  In line with this consistent approach, the County Monaghan Development Contributions Scheme applies development contribution charges for new farm buildings (including silos, concrete yards\/aprons, silage bases and slurry pits or towers), on the basis that they are a form of development, with such charges being required for the purpose of contributing towards the provision of Community, Recreation and Amenity facilities.  At present, the development charge levied on an agricultural building in County Monaghan is &euro;2 per square metre with an exemption for the first 300 square metres.  Unlike planning application fees, no increased charges are applied for retention of development.<\/p>  <p>  Section 48(4) of the Act of 2000 requires planning authorities to publish a draft development contribution scheme for public consultation, while section 48(5) provides that the Minister may make recommendations in relation to a draft scheme.  However, it is ultimately a matter for the elected members of a planning authority to adopt a development contribution scheme as a reserved function, having regard to any recommendations made by the Minister and the Chief Executive's report on the public consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing statutory and policy framework in this regard strikes the right balance between ensuring a transparent and broadly consistent levying of development contributions across the country, while also affording each local authority sufficient flexibility and discretion in the application of development contributions within their own respective functional areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":1567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1568,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[41689\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300086#WRDD05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will extend the time period in which farmers are allowed to spread slurry (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1569,"content":"<p>I refer to Question Nos. 278 and 280 of 28 September 2017.

In particular, the aim is to increase the supply of high quality social and affordable homes, as quickly as possible, in areas where demand is greatest. <\/p><p>Recent housing activity reports, available on\u00a0www.rebuildingireland.ie, show that strong supply-side measures being implemented under Rebuilding Ireland are beginning to have a positive impact, with all output indicators showing\u00a0positive upward trends, including a strong supply\u00a0programme of almost 700\u00a0social housing construction projects that will deliver\u00a0over 11,000 homes at various stages of the approval process.
