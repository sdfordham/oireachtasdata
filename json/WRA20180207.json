A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in June 2015, and is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the region.\u00a0 It includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, within clear timelines for delivery.  The Action Plans seek to capitalise on the particular strengths and opportunities of the region and has been developed by my Department, with the support of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, in close consultation with regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A central aim of the regional Action Plans for Jobs is to champion the concept of regional collaboration from the &lsquo;ground up&rsquo; to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the region that grows jobs and enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  There has been very good progress in the Midlands region in terms of employment creation since Q1 2015 with some 9,500 more people in employment up to Q2 2017.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Midland clients employed almost 12,500 people in the region in 2017 and County Westmeath enjoyed a 7% growth, the 7th highest in the country with 3,741 people now employed in the county.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region.  LEO Westmeath employed 1,375 people, an increase of 7% since 2014. Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In December last year, I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.

In addition, Longford is a partner in a\u00a0Stream 2 project to develop a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs with Leitrim and Cavan.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to launching a second call under\u00a0the REDF in March this year, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million.<\/p>  <p>  My priority is to continue to work with stakeholders collectively within the Midlands to build on the progress to date on implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs over the period to 2020,\u00a0and to focus on leveraging the key strengths of the region. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the National Planning Framework and development of\u00a0Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and with the Department of Rural and Community Development on roll-out of the Action Plan for Rural Development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Legal Cases","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[6011\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when she plans to publish an account of the investigative failures identified by a person (details supplied) and the steps that are being taken to address them emanating from the trial of a person.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and innovation have the statutory power to seek information from the Director of Corporate Enforcement about the performance of the Director&rsquo;s functions under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014.

Furthermore, the atypical work permission scheme established following the 2015 Government Task Force Report on EEA workers in the Irish fishing fleet, is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) on behalf of that Department.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the monitoring and enforcement of the atypical scheme for non-EEA fishers, it should be noted that a number of Departments and State agencies are involved.  These include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, INIS, the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Naval Service, the Revenue Commissioners, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p>  <p>  While the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, are under the remit of my Department, they are independent in the conduct of their statutory functions.  The WRC&rsquo;s responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation generally, including minimum wage legislation.  The HSA is the enforcement agency under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and conducts inspections under health and safety legislation at all places of work, including fishing vessels while docked in harbour.  It does not carry out inspections of fishing vessels at sea even when operating within Irish territorial waters. <\/p>  <p>  The Marine Survey Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has lead responsibility for fishing vessel safety, security and living and working conditions for the crew on board seagoing vessels.  It is responsible for enforcing legislation in this context for seafarers and fishing vessel crew. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific enquiries, it will be clear from the explanation provided that health and safety falls outside the remit of the WRC so the issue of resources at the WRC does not arise.  Responsibility in this area rests with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), an agency under the aegis of my department.  In relation to the recent unfortunate accident involving a non-EEA national on a fishing vessel, it is my understanding that the HSA is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of this incident in line with its remit under workplace health and safety legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  On the separate issue raised by the deputy of adequate training for WRC Inspectors to carry out inspections on fishing vessels, I can confirm to the Deputy that 9 Inspectors as well as a Regional Manager of the WRC completed comprehensive training in this regard.  This was delivered by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on safety at sea and sea survival techniques, including fire-fighting and first aid.  This training was a prerequisite to the deployment of WRC Inspectors for on-board inspections and operations at ports and landing places as the WRC, like the HSA, does not undertake inspections at sea.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the rate of inspections by the WRC since the atypical scheme commenced, the position is that WRC Inspectors have not traditionally had an active presence in the enforcement of employment rights and employment permits legislation in the fishing industry given the low incidence of employees in the sector, as opposed to fishers that are self-employed.  Some 181 vessels on the Irish Fishing Vessel Register come within the scope of the atypical Worker Permission Scheme, with 174 of these vessels being active or operational.  165 of these vessels have, to date been inspected by the WRC and it is the intention, in the context of inspection activity more generally, to complete inspections of the remaining 9 vessels.  In total, some 240 inspections of these vessels were undertaken by the WRC in the period July 2016 to 31 December 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Insofar as compliance levels are concerned, 202 contraventions of employment rights and\/or employment permits legislation were detected by WRC Inspectors in the period to the end of 2017: 29 or 14% of these contraventions relate to non-EEA fishers not having permission to work in the State.  The core requirement under the atypical Scheme is for non-EEA fishers to have a letter of permission from INIS to work on a specific vessel or vessels.  Other contraventions detected by WRC Inspectors include failure to keep records (35%), a failure to grant Public Holiday, Sunday Working and Annual Leave entitlements (19%) and failure to issue payslips (12%).  Contraventions were detected in some 112 of the 181 vessels coming within the scope of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA06400"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[5960\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700076#WRA06500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to introduce legislation to strengthen the effectiveness of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement;

As you are\u00a0aware, my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development has policy responsibility in relation to the Western Development Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government and my Department has been actively engaged in the regional jobs agenda through the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ)\u00a0initiative for the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in\u00a0December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.  This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling\u00a0&euro;60 million\u00a0is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. \u00a0The Fund\u00a0supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Manufacturing Research CLG project located in Mullingar was one of the significant funding recipients under Stream 1 of the REDF, which will be an important support to manufacturing activity\u00a0in the Midlands\u00a0region.

However,\u00a0CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands is currently at 9.3% (Q3 2017), which places the Midlands in a small group of those (including the South-East and Mid-West) whose unemployment rates are more than one percentage point higher than the State average.  This is\u00a0too high, especially since the Q3 2017 State average is 6.9%, and underlines the importance of retaining a focus on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the Midlands Plan has been embraced within the region and the Enterprise Agencies are working hard to drive local job creation and contribute to the job creation targets set out in the Plan.  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the region.  In 2016 client\u00a0companies of\u00a0the four Midlands\u00a0LEOs collectively added 327 new jobs, bringing total LEO supported employment in the region to 3,842.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. <\/p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force. The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain.<\/p>  <p>  While Brexit does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or Defence Policy, the UK has been an important interlocutor for Ireland and both countries have generally adopted similar policy positions in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Building a broader network of alliances at EU level has been an ongoing objective in recent years but has gained increased importance with the future departure of the UK.  The Department of Defence is currently conducting an internal review and analysis of issues where we have aligned with member States other than the UK.  We will cross reference this with peacekeeping partners on UN, CSDP and NATO\/PfP operations and like-minded States more generally as part of an ongoing process of identifying and building new alliances on the Security and Defence Agenda at EU level.  The results of this analysis will help inform our bilateral engagement at Ministerial and Official level over the coming period.     <\/p>  <p>  As Defence operates in a support role to a range of other Departments, Defence will assist and support those Departments\/Agencies in any analysis or research they are conducting which has implications for the level and nature of support offered by\/required from Defence.  To this end, Defence is engaging with lead Departments and Agencies as appropriate and the Defence Forces are engaged in prudent planning.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding resources, matters relating to Brexit are currently being absorbed and dealt with within existing Departmental structures and resources.  Accordingly there is currently no dedicated Brexit funding allocation required in the Department of Defence, nor are there any additional Brexit related roles envisaged at this time. <\/p>  <p>  The structures put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters.  The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of Branches in the Department.  The senior official represents the Department on the Senior Officials Group chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach and the Interdepartmental Group on EU and Brexit which is chaired by the Department of the Foreign Affairs and Trade and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.  In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an on-going basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[6336\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the involvement his Department has had in respect of contracts with a company (details supplied) that provide public private partnership contracts; the nature of the contract; if it was for capital construction or service supply; the duration of each contract; the value of fee commitments; the alternative arrangements he has made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I can confirm that neither the Department of Defence nor the Defence Forces have contracts with the company referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[6384\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"further to parliamentary Questions Nos. 288 of 25 October 2017 and 568 of 12 December 2017, the status of the Reserve Defence Forces lieutenant to captain fixed promotion scheme (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>The matter referred to by the Deputy is currently being progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards Data","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[6460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the persons on State boards under the aegis of his Department that are also serving on other State boards; the persons on State boards under the aegis of his department that have served previously on other State boards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>The only State body currently under the aegis of this Department is the Army Pensions Board.<\/p><p>The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions <\/p><p>Act 1927.

The Council also agreed that work should be taken forward through bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is most anxious that the NSMC be able to resume and progress this vital work.  Through the NSMC, the Government and Northern Ireland Executive can work together at an institutional level, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, to address the all-island implications of Brexit, where so many interests are shared, North and South.<\/p>  <p>  The work that the NSMC progressed in this respect in 2016 was very valuable and it has served as an important guide for the Government as we worked through Phase One of the EU-UK negotiations last year to secure the interests of Ireland, North and South.  The role of the NSMC in addressing the all-island implications of Brexit and enabling coordinated approaches by the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive has been clearly established.  In this context, there is no consideration being given to any changes to the North South Ministerial Council, which as an institution of the Good Friday Agreement has very important and clearly-established functions and responsibilities, which have been agreed to by all parties to the Peace Process founded on the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with EU partners and the European Commission Task Force to ensure that the Phase One commitments are delivered in full and that our interests, and those of the island as a whole, are advanced in the EU position in Phase Two, including the protection of North\/South co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wishes to see the NSMC urgently resume its work across all sectors, including the engagement on Brexit mandated last year, which can further inform the approach of Ireland, of the UK and of the European Union on the Ireland-specific issues, as Phase 2 of EU-UK negotiations progresses this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am intensively engaged at present, working with the Secretary for Northern Ireland, to support agreement between the political parties that will allow for the formation of a new Executive and the resumption of the North South Ministerial Council.  There remain challenges for the parties but I am convinced that an agreement can be reached between those parties, each of which wants to see the devolved institutions operating.<\/p>  <p>  A new Executive will be able to speak for Northern Ireland as the UK progresses its approach to the Article 50 negotiations, and the North South Ministerial Council will be able to resume its important work, including addressing the all-island issues and concerns that are raised by Brexit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[6255\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700078#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the invasion by Turkish forces of the Kurdish Afrin region in northern Syria; if he has raised this with the Turkish Government or received a briefing on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The conflict in Syria, and the destabilising impact it has had on the wider region, remain a source of deep concern.  Clearly, a comprehensive, inclusive political solution to the conflict is urgently needed, both to end the suffering of the Syrian people and to prevent any further turmoil in the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.<\/p>  <p>  At the December EU Foreign Affairs Council, we discussed the regional situation in the Middle East, including of course the urgent need for progress towards peace in Syria.  I joined colleagues in stressing the primacy of the UN-led Geneva process and the need for an inclusive political transition in Syria. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including over &euro;15 million to the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey.  Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.5 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland earlier this week.

Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience of returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland. <\/p><p>Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department of Finance on 22 December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;<i>to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad<\/i>&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. <\/p><p>The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.<\/p><p>If, however, a returning emigrant is continuing to have difficulty in obtaining insurance, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published by Department of Finance in\u00a0October 2016 (Updated March 2017);<\/p><p>- 'Modelling the Medium to Long\u00a0Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland'\u00a0-\u00a0Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in\u00a0November\u00a02016; and<\/p><p>- &lsquo;Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context&rsquo;\u00a0&ndash; An analysis of trade exposure to the UK in comparison to other EU Member States, published by the Department of Finance in\u00a0September 2017<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>All of these studies have been made public on the Department of Finance Brexit webpage:<i><i><\/i><\/i>.  Costs incurred for the 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'\u00a0 paper and the 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' paper, formed part of the overall costs under my Department&rsquo;s research programme with the ESRI.<\/p><p>The results in these studies published by my Department and the ESRI,\u00a0show that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant.\u00a0 In the joint paper my Department published with the ESRI,\u00a0that assessed the medium to long term potential macroeconomic impact of Brexit on Ireland, the study shows that ten\u00a0years after a UK exit from the EU, the level of Irish output, could reduce in a range from 2.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent and 3.8\u00a0per cent (i.e. under a EEA scenario, a FTA scenario and a WTO &ldquo;hard Brexit&rdquo; scenario, respectively), below a baseline of what it otherwise would have been.  These results are on a no policy change basis. However, with the future trade path between the UK and EU still unknown, it is crucially important that we prepare our economy for the challenges ahead. <\/p><p>In this context, the Government has already taken a number of important steps including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, Ireland Connected our Trade\u00a0and Investment Strategy and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.  The best way to deal with the uncertainties arising from Brexit\u00a0is to continue the Government&rsquo;s competitiveness oriented policies and prudent management of the public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[6322\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional budget for 2018 or other years, provided to his Department and all agencies and bodies within his remit to plan or prepare for Brexit; the number of additional staff that have been recruited to work on this policy area in each body, agency and his Department; the number of dedicated staff planning and working on Brexit matters in each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Assistant Secretary who heads\u00a0the EU and International Division of my Department\u00a0is designated as the lead official in the Department for Brexit matters.\u00a0 A\u00a0dedicated\u00a0Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate Brexit work across the entire Department and to act as a key liaison point, in particular with the Departments of the Taoiseach and of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\u00a0 There are currently four staff in the dedicated unit which is led at Principal Officer level.\u00a0 Also,\u00a0an additional\u00a0staff member has been assigned to\u00a0the Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels specifically to deal with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  We have appointed lead Brexit coordinators at Principal Officer level across all divisions of the Department.\u00a0\u00a0The challenges which we face as a result of Brexit are mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department and this is reflected in business planning. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit resourcing has been managed within the existing\u00a0paybill allocation.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0will continue to monitor the resources needed to respond to specific policy challenges on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the majority of the seventeen bodies under the aegis of my Department do not have additional funding or additional staff working on Brexit-related matters. <\/p>  <p>  The budget of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners provides for up to 40 additional staff for Brexit planning and preparation.  This work is carried out by a significant number of staff, currently estimated as 21 full-time equivalents, of whom 12 are dedicated to Brexit work full time, supported by additional staff throughout the organisation as required.  Preparations will intensify once the Article 50 negotiations progress and clarity has been provided as to the nature of the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK and the customs regime that will apply.  Additional resources will be allocated in line with these requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Many staff across the Central Bank\u00a0are working on Brexit-related matters on a daily basis in the course of their\u00a0duties.\u00a0 Given the nature of this work and how it relates to their role, the Central Bank has indicated that it is not\u00a0feasible to capture the total staff working on matters related to Brexit in the manner requested by the Deputy.  In 2017, the Central Bank allocated an additional 28 staff to address specific Brexit-related new business needs within existing divisions.  Of these 28 staff, 18 have been allocated to supervisory divisions to address specific Brexit-related new business needs within existing divisions. \u00a0In 2017, the Central Bank Commission also approved an additional 36 resources principally to support increases in Brexit-related authorisation\/supervisory activity, as well as to support extensions to the post crisis regulatory framework.<\/p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has indicated that it&rsquo;s direct exposure to the UK market is, at this stage, very limited, it continues to monitor any Brexit impact on the Irish assets securing its residual loan portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has not recruited or allocated staff to work exclusively on Brexit-related matters.  The NTMA is, however, continually monitoring Brexit developments and regards these as key considerations for 2018.  The NTMA has internal working groups relating to Brexit which have been staffed by existing employees.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has not allocated staff to work exclusively on Brexit-related matters.  The only identifiable direct budget item is the 2018 budget allocation of &euro;600,000 towards the Brexit Loan Scheme 1.  However, Brexit-related solutions remain a key consideration and focus for the SBCI and it expect that the overall cost for 2018 (or possibly 2019) may be higher than the budget allocation as it is expected that a second Brexit related scheme will be developed and rolled out in late 2018\/early 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":192,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No. 96.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards Data","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[6463\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the persons on State boards under the aegis of his Department that are also serving on other State boards; the persons on State boards under the aegis of his Department that have served previously on other State boards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for appointments to the boards of relevant bodies under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>All appointments are made in accordance with the requirements of the governing legislation and the Government Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards.\u00a0 However, the specific information sought by the Deputy is not available.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Details of current membership of all applicable State Boards are published on the <i>www.stateboards.ie<\/i>website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[6234\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if further investment in public private partnerships, PPPs, will be paused following the collapse of a company (details supplied) and the recent difficulties experienced by another company; the extent of PPP by the Government from 2005 to 2017, and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[6235\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the implications for the provision of services and the completion of incomplete contracts here in view of the recent difficulties being experienced by British PPP companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[6236\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on PPPs in view of the collapse of a company (details supplied) and the difficulties experienced by another company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 to 104, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model is an internationally recognised model to design, build, finance, operate and maintain public infrastructure.  In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.<\/p><p>Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected.  <\/p><p>It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market.  In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational.  These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues - which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs. <\/p><p>While Carillion&rsquo;s liquidation does give rise to a delay in completing the remaining construction works, payments under the PPP contract will not be made until the full works and services as set out under the project agreement are satisfactorily delivered for each school.<\/p><p>For these reasons, I do not see any need to pause PPPs currently in procurement or planning, as the contract terms of the PPP project will deal with the potential situation whereby a contractor or partner in the PPP company may become insolvent during the term of the contract.<\/p><p>However, as the Deputy may be aware, I established an Inter-Departmental \/ Inter-Agency Group last year to review Ireland's experience of using PPP and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.  I would expect the Group's deliberations to take account of any implications for future national PPP policy of the development referred to in the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>With regard to the extent to which PPPs have been used by Government, a summary update on PPP projects which are either operational or where contracts have been signed is available at the website <i>. <\/i>A copy of the table is set out for the Deputy's information.  The table summarises information on PPP projects across the public sector indicating for each project, the value of the contract, the operational date of the project and the name of the company to which the contract was awarded. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that the table is intended to provide indicative information in relation to PPP projects generally, based on information provided to my Department by the sponsoring  Departments or Agencies.  The Central PPP Policy Unit in my Department endeavours to ensure that the information is as accurate as possible but any queries in relation to specific projects should be confirmed with the State authorities responsible for those projects.<\/p><p><b>Exchequer funded financial commitments under Public Private Partnerships and Concession Projects<\/b><table><tr><th>Department\/Agency <\/th><th>Project\u00a0Classification<\/th><th>Operational From<\/th><th>Contractual\u00a0\u00a0Value\u00a0(&euro;,m)<\/th><th>PPP Unitary\u00a0Payments to End 2016\u00a0(&euro;,m)<\/th><th>Projected Future\u00a0PPP Unitary Payments in NOMINAL Terms\u00a0(&euro;,m)<\/th><th>Other PPP\u00a0Payments, where available\u00a0(&euro;,m)<\/th><th>Projected Total\u00a0Cost of all PPP Payments\u00a0(&euro;,m)<\/th><th>Year of Final\u00a0Payment<\/th><th>PPP Company<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Health<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Primary Care   Bundle<\/td><td>DBFM<\/td><td>Phased   from Q3 2017<\/td><td>140.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>422.3<\/td><td>35.5<\/td><td>457.8<\/td><td>2042<\/td><td>Healthcare   Centres PPP Limited<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OPW<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Conference Centre<\/td><td>DBFOM<\/td><td>Aug-10<\/td><td>189.8<\/td><td>269.2<\/td><td>477.3<\/td><td>32.9<\/td><td>779.4<\/td><td>2035<\/td><td>Spencer   Dock Convention Centre Dublin Ltd<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Justice<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Criminal Courts Complex<\/td><td>DBFOM<\/td><td>Nov-09<\/td><td>132.4<\/td><td>149.7<\/td><td>455.9<\/td><td>17.9<\/td><td>623.5<\/td><td>2035<\/td><td>IPP   CCC Partnership Ltd.

Having visited the area the following day I saw at first hand the extensive damage and disruption caused by this flood event, particularly to the community in the Inishowen Peninsula area. <\/p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address. Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under this Office's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme, introduced in 2009, is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The OPW has approved 32 Minor Works schemes in Donegal at a cost of &euro;1.2m.  Details of these schemes are on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie<\/i><\/p><p>A national study to assess and propose measures to manage Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) through its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The CFRAM Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, designated in 2012 as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding.  This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  <\/p><p>Carndonagh and Clonmany are two communities that have been studied as part of the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM Programme.<\/p><p>In relation to Carndonagh, the Plans propose measures consisting of using storage areas along with a series of embankments and walls along the Donagh  River . Improved channel conveyance would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Carndonagh watercourse and hard defences would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Glennagannon  River.  <\/p><p>As the flood risk in Clonmany was assessed as relatively low no structural flood relief schemes are proposed, at this time.  The Plans set out those non-structural measures in place or proposed that can benefit all at risk communities and properties, including emergency response, national flood forecasting, individual property protection and community resilience. <\/p><p>The Plans are currently subject to an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Forms","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[6201\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700079#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to allow persons in receipt of a Garda pension to have their P60 issued in January of each year (details supplied);

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.

This involves appropriate instruction in a variety of movement forms that are designed to enhance the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development of all pupils.  Dance is one such movement form.  The Department encourages schools to make every effort to deliver the Dance strand, which is one component of a comprehensive Physical Education at both primary and post-primary level. <\/p>  <p>  As a study of human movement, Physical Education aims to support pupils in developing physical competence and understanding so they are able to move efficiently, effectively and safely.  It is also focused on supporting pupils to develop positive physical activity behaviours, and to enjoy the many social and emotional benefits, including the physical and cognitive benefits that result from being physically active.  All schools are expected to deliver a comprehensive Physical Education curriculum, as prescribed by the Department.  It is important that pupils are supported in developing a proficiency in, and understanding of, the fundamental and transferable movement patterns inherent across all of the physical activity strands of the curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, promoting physical activity is reflected in the 24 'statements of learning' that are at the core of the Framework for Junior Cycle.  Dance could also feature as part of a short course which could be developed and offered by a school, or by using the Performing Arts short course developed by the NCCA.  Additionally, provision for PE forms part of the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme.  The Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme began with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new Junior Cycle is implemented fully in schools. PE, along with CSPE and SPHE form part of the Wellbeing Programme.<\/p>  <p>  A 100 hour short course in Physical Education was made available to all schools in 2015.

This strand aims to build students&rsquo; competency in and understanding of artistic and aesthetic movement, as they create and perform in a group for an audience in either gymnastics or dance.  The process of creating the dance or gymnastic movement sequence is seen as being equally important as the final performance.

These activities are selected from six distinct physical activity areas which reflect the activities more commonly included in school physical education programmes currently.  The Physical Activity area &lsquo;Artistic and aesthetic activities&rsquo; includes Gymnastics: artistic, rhythmic And Dance: contemporary, folk, modern, ballet, jazz, tap, ethnic, traditional.<\/p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate Physical Education is designed to be taught in approximately 180 hours.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. <\/p><p>All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.\u00a0 Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning framework\u00a0is firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.\u00a0 My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework. <\/p><p>Our work has been facilitated by the International Unit of my Department which, under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary General, has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit. \u00a0In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group which oversees the coordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union including Brexit.This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on Brexit Coordination; the Economy and Sectoral Issues; the Common Travel Area; and the\u00a0Island of Ireland Working Group.<\/p><p>The International Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Sectoral Issues strand of co-ordination. The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments\/Agencies.\u00a0 Meetings of the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Group took place on 28 October 2016, 15 February; 24 May and 9 October 2017 and most recently focused on stakeholder consultations input and research collaboration.  A further meeting is planned for early 2018.<\/p><p>This Unit has been prioritising Brexit work to date and will keep staffing requirements under constant review.  At this stage, it is anticipated that any additional needs arising can be provided for from within existing Departmental resources.  No specific funding has been allocated to agencies and bodies within my Department&rsquo;s remit for the purposes of staffing dedicated to\u00a0Brexit preparations, nor has my Department engage external bodies to carry out Brexit-related impact assessments.<\/p><p>However my Department has been working closely with a number of organisations, and in particular with the Higher Education Authority, in Brexit planning for the higher education sector.\u00a0 The HEA has published a Brexit issues paper and has held meetings with the HEIs to discuss ongoing planning and issues with them as the process develops.\u00a0 We will continue to engage in this important aspect of planning and research work, and during 2018 will maintain our extensive engagement with stakeholders across the sector, which has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit since late 2016.<\/p><p>While Brexit presents numerous challenges, it is likely to bring opportunities too.  Funding of &euro;1.5m was provided in Budget 2017 to attract researchers to Ireland, as part of our strategic response to Brexit.  This &euro;1.5m is again available in 2018.<\/p><p>Under the Action Plan for Education 2018 we will enhance our strategy to attract world-leading researchers to Ireland in the context of Brexit.

Ireland supports comparable trade conditions for investors and businesses across the Americas, making it easier for Irish businesses to trade in and enter these markets.  Negotiations with the Mercosur countries continues and political agreement was reached last year with Japan on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).  The EU\/Japan EPA has the potential to generate significant benefits for Ireland.  The agrifood sector, which is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, will see particular benefits, with improved access for beef and dairy products. The Agreement will also ensure tariff elimination on medical devices and pharmaceutical products which are manufactured in Ireland.<\/p><p>Moreover, in his September 2017 State of the Union Address to the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  The draft negotiating mandates for Australia and New Zealand are currently being discussed by the Commission and Member States.<\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements coupled with our programme of Minister led trade missions and bilateral visits overseas have provided a key foundation on which to further build our strong economic and trading links in export markets and this will continue.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore and Japan, the UAE and Oman, and a major trade programme as part of the Presidential State visit to Australia.<\/p><p>Ireland will also continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which we hope will be available later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700081#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":336,"content":"<p>Question No. 154 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700081#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[51905\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700081#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there are plans to reallocate the programme for research in third level institutions from her Department back to the Department of Education and Skills, in view of the fact that this fund is critical for continued investment in research institutes and higher education facilities.","asker":"1323","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>The PRTLI was launched in 1998 and there have been 5 cycles of awards to date.  The programme awards funding on a competitive basis to Higher Education Institutions to build underpinning research infrastructure, develop postgraduate research education, and develop sustainable, long-term and broadly-based research capability in key strategic research areas. <\/p>  <p>  The PRTLI has involved &euro;1.2 billion of public and private investment to date in physical research facilities and support for human capital for research.  This has complemented the investments of Science Foundation Ireland and other research funders. <\/p>  <p>Up to 2010 the PRTLI was the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills (DES), and was administered by the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  With effect from 1 May 2010 responsibility for the PRTLI transferred to my Department under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2010.  The HEA was requested to continue administering PRTLI Cycle 5 on behalf of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The transfer of functions was intended to bring together a streamlined and focused programme of funding of research and development and further strengthen the alignment of the programme with other R&amp;D programmes of my Department.

My Department has been working with the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and others to develop potential supports to respond to the needs of businesses impacted by Brexit.  The Brexit Loan Scheme, announced during Budget 2018, will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future.  The Scheme will be delivered by the SBCI through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses.  The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to SMEs and Small Mid Caps Funds.  The Scheme will be open to businesses of up to 499 employees, which can also demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy.  The Scheme is expected to open for applications in late March 2018, and will run until 31 March 2020. <\/p>  <p>  EI offers a range of activities and supports to companies, including along the Border Region, to innovate and remain competitive in international markets.  Activities currently being undertaken by EI to ensure that client companies are resilient and agile include the following:<\/p>  <p>- EI is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint.  To support this, on 1 February Enterprise Ireland launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets.  This fund provides support towards internal and external costs incurred when researching new markets for products and services.<\/p>  <p>  - EI is working with its clients in the Border Region to drive innovation activity via supports that enable companies to diagnose their innovation readiness, provides financial support for in-house R&amp;D projects and fosters collaborations.<\/p>  <p>  - EI is working with companies to identify competitiveness issues and to support companies by providing access to a range of competitiveness building tools, including the Company Competitiveness Health Check, the Lean Offer and Green Offer. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides supports to assist companies, such as those located in the Border Region, to be aware and to for prepare for Brexit, for example:<\/p>  <p>  - Launched a &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.<\/p>  <p> - Launched a Be Prepared Grant that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  This grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.<\/p>  <p>  - Ran a national Prepare for Brexit Breakfast Roadshows and is currently engaging with companies throughout the country on preparing for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  - Launched the in-market Irish Advantage campaign promoting Irish companies to buyers in key markets and sectors.<\/p>  <p>  An extra &euro;4 million in funding for the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in 2017 was allocated to fund a range of initiatives including Brexit supports across the country.  These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to cope with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit.  The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.  The six LEOs in the Border region are also working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies in the Border Region are resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit.  To this end, I am committed to ensuring that Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs will continue to work with companies from the region to drive their innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG00600"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[6118\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if a reply will issue to correspondence from a person (details supplied) regarding a work permit application; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>An application for a General Employment Permit for the person concerned was received on 23 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  A decision was made to refuse the granting of the application on 18 January 2018, and the applicant has been notified of this decision in writing and of their right to request a review of this decision in line with the provisions of the Employment Permits Acts within 28 days. <\/p>  <p>  This application was refused on the basis that it appears that the occupation in question was an ineligible occupation for the purposes of obtaining an employment permit based on information provided by the applicant including the description of the employment to be undertaken and the job specifications.<\/p>  <p>  A refusal to grant an employment permit does not preclude an applicant from submitting another application for an employment permit.

The challenges will impact upon firms across a range of time horizons &ndash; from the immediate to the long-term. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway across government to identify and address the issues arising as a result of Brexit.  Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship.  DBEI is a significant contributor to this process, given the wide range of Brexit impacts across the Department&rsquo;s remit. <\/p>  <p>  While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, very detailed work on a no-deal or worst-case-scenario is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\u00a0 This work is progressing and is focusing on possible mitigating measures.  This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. <\/p>  <p>  My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance. Brexit impacts upon all of these areas, and on many others within the Department&rsquo;s remit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department recently published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which summarises the issues facing enterprise, the policy measures my Department has already taken, those we plan to take, our research programme designed to inform these policies, and the Departmental structural reforms put in place to ensure that we can work as efficiently and effectively as possible to support our companies.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies.  Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Helping Firms to Compete;<\/p>  <p>  - Enabling Firms to Innovate;<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting Firms to Trade;<\/p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;<\/p>  <p>  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the commitments included in APJ 2017, and the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification.  This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. <\/p>  <p>  Specific DBEI actions to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - The roll-out of the Brexit Loan Scheme to provide affordable financing to Irish firms impacted by Brexit.  The scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to business with less than 500 employees.<\/p>  <p>  - We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. <\/p>  <p>  - The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme.  The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, Action Plan for Jobs 2018 will continue to act as an effective lever for driving reforms that enhance the competitiveness of Irish firms, increase jobs and grow the resilience of our economy in the context of Brexit, while we are also finalising a review of Enterprise 2025 to take account of Brexit and other global challenges over the longer term.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":364,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 51.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[6353\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700082#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she and her Department continue to support and drive the creation of new enterprises in the indigenous sector throughout the country with particular reference on the need to encourage the generation of employment in the regions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>Driving more job creation at a regional level by supporting the indigenous sector is a key focus of mine and I am working closely with the Local Enterprise Offices and with Enterprise Ireland to achieve this.

To support the eight Regional Action Plans, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by EI over the next 4 years.  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund will support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of the Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support competitiveness.  The National Competitiveness Council, an independent advisory body, tasked with reporting through me to the Taoiseach and the Government on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy, is composed, amongst others, of business representatives&rsquo; bodies and companies from the\u00a0 manufacturing and services sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, our cost base, the shortage and cost of residential property, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that Ireland must address barriers to investment and growth, drive productivity performance and be responsive to competitiveness challenges and opportunities that are emerging. <\/p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs. Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, must continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically to reduce the market exposure which Brexit has highlighted.

Additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in every county continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.  Results for 2017 are expected to be published shortly. The 2016 Local Enterprise Office (LEO) annual jobs survey results highlighted three consecutive years of local jobs growth in small and micro-businesses throughout the country: in 2016 there was a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies stood at 34,634. <\/p>  <p>  I want to also draw your attention to the ongoing implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development &ndash; &lsquo;Realising our Rural Potential&rsquo;. Launched in January 2017, the Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan includes commitments from a number of Departments and State agencies, including the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, which will support employment and improve the quality of life for people living in rural areas.  A key component of the Plan is to support the creation of jobs throughout the regions to ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally.  The Plan aims to deliver 135,000 extra jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The first 6 monthly progress support showed good progress in the implementation of the Action Plan; with delays to only 7 actions.

Real progress has been made towards that target over the first three years of this strategy with half of all jobs created by IDA client companies since 2015 based outside Dublin.  Just under 30,000 jobs have been created in the regions in three years, a positive trend towards increasing the regional spread of FDI all over our country.<\/p><p>A key component of attracting potential multinational investors is the availability of IDA properties across all counties of Ireland.

In 2017 209,338 people were employed at Enterprise Ireland supported companies which includes the creation of 10,309 net new jobs.  In 2017 65% of employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies was outside of Dublin. Employment growth was recorded across all counties. <\/p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has invested in infrastructure to support building research and innovation capabilities within regions such as the national network of Technology located in Institutes of Technology through the country.

The previous regulations did not designate chiropractors as referrers or practitioners.   <\/p>  <p>  Ionising radiation has many beneficial applications however as the use of ionising radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained.  The BSSD is an essential piece of legislation which protects the public, patients, workers and others from all forms of ionising radiation.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department conducted a general consultation on the BSSD in June 2017 and sought views on the provisions of the Directive where Member States had discretion.  The Chiropractic Association of Ireland (CAI) was included in my Department's notification of the consultation process and arrangements were made to contact all licence-holders of ionising radiation equipment advising them of the consultation.  Information on the consultation process was also posted on my Department&rsquo;s website.  No response was received from the CAI or any individual identifying as a chiropractor.  <\/p>  <p>  The statutory instrument transposing the BSSD will designate those who may refer for radiological tests, those who may carry them out and other functions and in this regard I propose to designate nurses, doctors, dentists and radiographers as appropriate.  The proposed designation of relevant professionals is based on patient safety and public health considerations reflected in the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.  <\/p>  <p>  The previous regulations lacked inspection or enforcement provisions, however, in the new regulations HIQA will have the inspection and enforcement powers to enforce compliance and contravention of the new regulations will be an offence.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall responsibility for the transposition of the BSSD.

This service plays a vital role in ensuring quality and continuity of care at the end of life stage, and enables people who wish to die at home to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  Night Nursing is accessed by referral through community-based specialist palliative care services and GPs.  A terminally ill person usually receives the service for between two and ten nights, depending on their need and how impending end of life is.  An external evaluation has shown that, broadly, families and healthcare professionals are happy with the service.<\/p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of an aging population in Ireland, coupled with increasing numbers of death from cancer, dementia, and neurodegenerative diseases, there is an associated increased palliative care need.  Because many people wish to die at home, there is an increased demand for the Night Nursing Service.  The Irish Hospice Foundation anticipates that the cost for services it provides will increase by up to 20% in the next few years.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published its Palliative Care Services Three Year Development Framework in November 2017.  It acknowledges that, unfortunately, there are variations in the availability of specialist palliative care services, including out of hours care .

A national review of the need for access 24 hour \/ 7 day services has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  One of the Framework&rsquo;s actions points is that night nursing should be regarded to be a core generalist service, and that steps should be taken to progress, on a phased basis, towards the State providing 50% of the funding required for the current Night Nursing Service.  Discussions are already under way between the HSE, the Irish Cancer Society, and the Irish Hospice Foundation to determine a timeframe to achieve this. <\/p>  <p>  The Government respects the desire of people who wish to remain in their own home, especially in the final days of their lives.

While the majority of people with dementia are aged over 65, it is important to remember that one in ten people diagnosed with dementia are under 65.<\/p><p>As a response to the increasing number of people with dementia, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014.

My Department and the HSE are working on a review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the first quarter of 2018 and will identify what has been achieved so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy.  The work on the review will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.<\/p><p>In parallel with the Strategy, the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was set up by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies.  &euro;27.5 million was committed to the Programme for a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive home care packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.  My Department and the HSE have committed to maintaining the NDSIP structures and oversight arrangements for at least a period of 5 years up to the end of 2019.<\/p><p>In the medium term, the HSE plans to create compassionate, inclusive communities for people with dementia and their carers, by building a network of local and national partnerships under the Dementia Understand Together campaign.

In this capacity, the Department of Health is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This co-operation also involves the relevant State Agencies. Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship.<\/p>  <p>  While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, very detailed work on a no-deal or worst-case-scenario is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade . This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. <\/p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health.  A number of issues are being examined and contingency planning for a range of eventualities is under way.  A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis.  The health sector has a highly mobile workforce and free movement issues and the mutual recognition and assurance of professional qualifications are being considered.  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry.  Ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority.  The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines.  The implications of Brexit for networks and organisations such as the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, the European Reference Networks on rare diseases and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are also under consideration. <\/p>  <p>  These issues are currently being examined by my Department and its agencies and this work will continue over the period ahead. The key priorities for my Department are to ensure continuity in the provision of health services and to avoid, or mitigate changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health. These are also key factors in considering the prioritisation of risks. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of allocation of resources, the Deputy Secretary, Policy and Strategy Division, and the Assistant Secretary, R and D and Health Analytics Division are the lead officials in my Department for planning and coordination in respect of Brexit.  The Department of Health participates fully in the Senior Officials Group on EU Affairs, the Interdepartmental Group on EU and Brexit and its workgroups as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Department established a Management Board subcommittee on Brexit in advance of the UK referendum, to examine the implications of a decision to leave the EU.  The Subcommittee is chaired at senior level and made up of representatives from across the Department, as well as from the HSE, which is represented at National Director level.  <\/p>  <p>  Brexit raises many issues across a wide range of areas that need to be addressed.  Work on each specific issue involves line Units with policy responsibility.  In this way, work on Brexit-related issues is being mainstreamed throughout the Department. <\/p>  <p>Within my Department, the International and Research Policy Unit provides a co-ordinating function in relation to Brexit just as it does for other international matters and North-South cooperation.  The Department has a full-time EU health attach&eacute; assigned to the Permanent Representation in Brussels, who is in regular contact with International and Research Policy Unit and other Units throughout the Department.  Staffing and resources allocated to Brexit in my Department are kept under ongoing review.   <\/p>  <p>  Brexit has been identified as a specific priority in the HSE National Service Plan.  The HSE has established a Steering Group to examine and assess the issues and risks associated with Brexit and the implications for the Executive.  The group consists of representatives from across Directorates and is examining a number of priority areas.  Other agencies including the HPRA are also prioritising actions on Brexit including engagement with the EMA and stakeholders in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01000"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[6341\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the involvement his Department has had in respect of contracts with a company (details supplied) that provide public private partnership contracts; the nature of the contract; if it was for capital construction or service supply; the duration of each contract; the value of fee commitments; the alternative arrangements he has made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>A payment was made to the company in question in July 2017 following a procurement exercise through the Office of Government Procurement's Framework for the Provision of Security Software and Associated Reseller Services, in respect of maintenance and three year licensing for Sophos Anti Virus protection in the amount of &euro;40,811.40.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01300"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[6392\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reinstate the Millstreet ambulance service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>As the question raised by the Deputy relates to a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[6393\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount that has been allocated for gay men's health services in 2018; the way in which this budget will be spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[6451\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application by an organisation (details supplied) to the HSE seeking further funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland. <\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.

This may enable landowners to get a better return from their investment in forestry, as well as providing the revenue needed to cover reforestation costs to continue the forest cycle. <\/p>  <p>  The All Ireland Forecast shows that there is the potential to increase the private harvest by over 2.5 million cubic metres by the end of the next decade.  Based on this forecast, the value of timber harvested in 2017 by private forest owners in County Leitrim can be estimated at &euro;1.2 million.  However, it is the continuous cycle of activity that takes place within the entire forest estate that delivers benefits for the wider economy.  These activities begin in the forest nursery where the trees are grown, forests are then established which requires machines to prepare the site and people to plant and care for the trees.  Forest roads are needed prior to first thinning, which could be followed by up to three further thinnings before the final clearfell.  Haulage companies are then hired to transport the logs to processors.  Once the trees are felled the forest is replanted and the cycle restarts from the beginning. <\/p>  <p>  The network of companies established to service the forest industry within Leitrim and throughout the country is only possible because the national forest estate has achieved a scale that can support these businesses.  While it is the case that forest owners do not receive a forest premium on the second and subsequent rotations, forests will start to generate an income at first thinning.  However, when we look beyond the individual forests and look at the wide range of activities that take place throughout the 28,000 hectares of forestry in County Leitrim the wider benefits become apparent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK05200"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[6274\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700085#WRK05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a GLAS payment for a person (details supplied) will be processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>The above named\u00a0was approved into GLAS\u00a01 and has received all payments in respect of scheme years 2015 and 2016.<\/p>  <p>  All GLAS claims must clear validation checks before payment can be made.\u00a0 My Department is\u00a0working\u00a0proactively to complete the checks to allow for the issue of payments.

The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.

Firstly,\u00a0in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I established a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.

These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in their market insight and market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities.

Adults in jobless households are not all unemployed; they include people who are not seeking work for reasons such as disability or caring responsibilities.  The plan therefore sets out to extend activation services to people who are not working but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures.  It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children &ndash; both the traditional &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; family and the lone parent family.  A number of key policy actions to achieve that goal are currently underway, most notably:  <\/p><p>1.  <b>Extending active engagement<\/b>with the Intreo employment service to additional groups of economically inactive working age adults who could, with appropriate supports, take up employment.  In this regard, the process of increasing Intreo engagement with lone parents and with people with disabilities has been continuing since the publication of the Plan. <\/p><p>2.  <b>Progressing plans to pilot a new family focused case management approach<\/b>in five geographical areas (Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Dundalk and Tallaght) to improve employment rates and reduce joblessness in households across Ireland.  These pilots are being prepared and will commence in the first half of this year. <\/p><p>3.  <b>Improving the earnings of people with families when they transition from welfare to employment.<\/b>There are a number of social protection measures arising from Budget 2018 that strengthen this commitment: <\/p><p>- The National Minimum Wage has increased to &euro;9.55 per hour from January 2018.  This is an increase of 30 cent an hour and reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to make work pay.  This increase will directly benefit approximately 155,000 people and their families.<\/p><p>- The Qualified Child payment, which is paid to families with children, will increase from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 for each child.  This is the first increase to this payment in over seven years and will benefit over 400,000 children.<\/p><p>- The Working Family Payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) thresholds increased by &euro;10 per week for families of 1, 2 or 3 children.  This scheme particularly benefits low-income working families and my Department will carry out a promotion and information campaign in the coming months to encourage families to see if they are eligible for this payment. <\/p><p>- The Back to Work Family Dividend, a payment for families with children who sign off their welfare payments and enter employment, was due to close to new entrants in March 2018.  I am keeping this scheme open, as it helps families make the transition from welfare to work.  Currently, over 8,000 families with 16,500 dependent children benefit from this payment. <\/p><p>- The income disregard for Jobseekers&rsquo; Transition recipients and lone parents returning to work increased by &euro;20 to &euro;130 per week.  This will benefit lone parents earning more than &euro;110 per week and is in addition to the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of payment and &euro;2 increase in the qualified child payment. <\/p><p>- In terms of services for children, funding has been increased for the School Meals programme to include the newly-designated DEIS schools.<\/p><p>- Finally, with regard to supports for families with children, I can confirm that we have retained funding to ensure that the increase of 25% to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance announced in 2017 will be continued this year.<\/p><p>In order to drive action on household joblessness, progress against each of the reform actions and milestones will be monitored and reported on quarterly to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and Jobs.  The plan also sets <b>two new headline targets<\/b>for 2020:<\/p><p>- Reducing the proportion of households that are jobless to 13% or less (from 18% in 2015), and<\/p><p>- Reducing the share of the 18-59 population resident in such households to less than 8% (from 12 &amp;amp; in 2015).  Performance against these targets will be published on an annual basis.<\/p><p>Implementation of the above policy measures should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.  These targets are in addition to the existing <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>targets 2020 &ndash; bringing unemployment down to between 5% and 6%, bringing long-term unemployment below 2.5%, and bringing youth unemployment below 12%.<\/p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households<\/i>is about employment activation and removing barriers that are currently preventing people from getting a fair chance, and for some a second chance, which is at the core of building a Republic of Opportunity for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700088#WRN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":725,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700088#WRN03600"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[6247\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020700088#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason it is not possible for persons on community employment schemes to stay on them in cases in which both they and their employer are satisified with the arrangement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":727,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.

In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to remedial works, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works\u00a0with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including Part B (Fire Safety), rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Act 1981, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, I tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department, in June 2017,\u00a0with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead\u00a0a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.\u00a0 I expect to be provided with their full and final report shortly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.<\/p>  <p>  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and the Bill\u00a0was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.\u00a0 I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to\u00a0progressing the drafting as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Once it is enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with\u00a0the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going in my Department to review Part B\/Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B &ndash; Fire (2006).\u00a0A new Part B\/TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017, in relation to dwellings.
