These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">These phased PSPR changes across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">The cost of amending PSPR as currently applied by increasing the threshold before PSPR is applied to &euro;50,000 is estimated to incur a further cost of &euro;90 million per year.

The Programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each Area for Further Assessment (AFA), the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. <\/p>  <p>  Good progress continues to be made this year also on the implementation of the CFRAM Programme.  The Programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for 300 areas of significant flood risk, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans for those areas.<\/p>  <p>  The draft flood mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23rd December, 2015.  Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk has been completed.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific viable measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The draft Plans are scheduled to be made available for public consultation from mid-2016.  Following the public consultation process the finalised Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  <\/p>  <p>  The OPW implements major flood relief schemes to protect our main towns and cities through its Flood Relief Capital Works Programme, carries out maintenance of those schemes and earlier, mainly agricultural schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  <\/p>  <p>  The total funding available to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for its overall flood risk management programme in 2016 is &euro;80.746 million.  This amount includes provision for expenditure on capital flood relief works, on arterial drainage maintenance activities, the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, purchase of plant and machinery, hydrometric and hydrological investigation and monitoring and on the general administrative costs of operating the programme.  Full details are provided in the Revised Estimates Volume 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Of the total allocation of &euro;80.746 million, an amount of &euro;52.561 million has been provided in 2016 for expenditure on flood relief capital works.  This amount provides for the preparation and design of flood relief schemes, the construction of flood relief works, the payment of compensation costs arising from these works and the carrying out of minor coastal or non-coastal works by Local Authorities with funding provided by the OPW under the Minor Works Scheme.  It also provides for the carrying out of the CFRAM programme.  The 2016 allocation includes a deferred surrender or capital carryover of &euro;7m from the 2015 allocation.  Expenditure on the flood relief programme in 2015 was less than budgeted for due primarily to delays in the planned commencement of construction of certain capital projects.  The system of deferred surrender or capital carryover ensures that the funding is not lost to the flood capital investment programme. <\/p>  <p>  Expenditure to date by the OPW in 2016 on its overall flood risk management programme is &euro;23.223 million.  Within this amount direct expenditure to date on the implementation of flood relief schemes and the CFRAM Programme is &euro;10m approximately.  This is somewhat ahead of the amount profiled for this at the beginning of the year. Good progress is being made on the implementation of all the main elements of the programme and I am satisfied that, while not without some challenges, expenditure of the full allocation for the year remains on target.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the capital works element of the programme in particular, major schemes in Ennis, Waterford and the river Wad in Dublin will be completed this year.  Works are continuing on the major schemes in Bray, on the River Dodder in Dublin and on the quays in Dublin.  The Deputy will be pleased to hear also that works have now commenced on the River Clare scheme in Claregalway, contracts have been signed for the major schemes in Bandon and Skibbereen and the contractors are mobilising to commence construction of those works in the next few weeks.  The schemes for Templemore, Foynes and Dunkellin are expected to commence construction in 2016 also.  Another 21 schemes will continue to be advanced through design and planning stages.<\/p>  <p>  Smaller scale flood relief works continue to be funded in 2016 through the OPW's Minor Works scheme which puts local authorities in funds to carry out more localised flood mitigation measures.  Expenditure of &euro;2.5 - &euro;3.0 million is anticipated on this scheme in 2016.  Approximately 30 projects have been approved for funding to date in 2016 which brings the total number approved since 2009 when the scheme was introduced to 544 with total expenditure of &euro;30m. approximately. <\/p>  <p>  In the important area of maintenance, each year the OPW carries out work to approximately 2,000km of channels and some 200 structures around the country as part of its ongoing and rolling arterial drainage maintenance programme.  &euro;15.3 million is allocated to the maintenance programme nationally in 2016 and this programme and funding is fully committed for 2016.  Expenditure to date in 2016 on the maintenance programme is &euro;7.1 million which is in line with profiled expenditure.  The timing of work on individual projects is determined having regard to the needs of regular maintenance and the prioritisation of urgent jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief will be required and are being provided for as part of the overall Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration and implementation of measures arising from the CFRAM Flood Risk Management Plans.  This Partnership Government is demonstrating its support of flood relief by committing to the &euro;430m for Flood Risk Management (FRM) included within the 2016-2021 Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan.

This resulted in the publication in September 2015 of 'Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021', which outlined a &euro;42bn framework for infrastructural investment across Ireland.

To support the planned Exchequer capital investment and &euro;14.5bn commercial State sector investment elements of the Capital Plan, a new third phase of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to a value of &euro;500m was announced as part of the Capital Plan.  This off-balance sheet investment via PPP was specifically targeted at addressing priority needs in three areas - education, health and justice - while Phase 2 of the PPP programme announced in Budget 2015 is targeting social housing.  Phase 1 of the PPP programme, announced in 2012, is addressing infrastructural needs in the areas of education, health, justice and transport.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a review of Government priorities within the Capital Plan in the context of the mid term review to be undertaken in early 2017.

The Summer Economic Statement provided for a further additional &euro;1 billion capital investment, over and above the &euro;4 billion already signalled in the Programme for a Partnership Government, thus bringing the planned total extra spending on capital investment to &euro;5 billion over the period of the plan.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">In undertaking the mid-term review of the Capital Plan in 2017, my Department will continue to consider the potential for alternative financing mechanisms to supplement direct exchequer investment in infrastructure, including off-balance sheet models.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600075#WRC00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600075#WRC00250"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[19807\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600075#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his approach to companies receiving large public procurement contracts and yet not recognising trade unions when industrial issues arise.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p><font color=\"#181818\">Public procurement is governed by EU and National rules.

This is a marked change from when the matter was considered by the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision which reported on the matter just over a year ago.  In that regard, significant progress has been made in the processing of caseloads by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of those longest in the system and this is reflected in both the reduction in the length of time persons are in the system and the overall reducing numbers in Direct Provision accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of duration of stay in the Direct Provision system, it should be noted that RIA provides accommodation supports for persons who have been granted a protection status and are in the process of transitioning out of the system.  It also provides accommodation for failed protection applicants who are the subject of a Deportation Order and who are legally obliged to remove themselves from the State. <\/p>  <p>  The median processing time in respect of asylum decisions taken during the period 1 January 2016 to 30 April 2016 for those in Direct Provision accommodation was 25 months approximately, a reduction of over 3 months on the corresponding period in 2015.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the total amount paid for direct provision accommodation was &euro;53.143m.

Domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2015 with consumer spending increasing by 3.5 per cent and investment, boosted by intellectual property assets, up by 28 per cent.  Domestic demand looks set to make a strong contribution once more this year.<\/p>  <p>  Domestic demand is supported by the continuing broad based recovery of the labour market.  Employment grew by 2.4 per cent over the year to\u00a0the first quarter of 2016, equivalent to an increase of almost 47,000 jobs with gains recorded in 12 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.

Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by 6.5 per cent over the same period.  New cars licensed for the first time were up almost 25 per cent to end-May year-on-year.

While this was mainly driven by the modern sectors, it is important to note that the more traditional, labour intensive, sectors have also shown strong growth.

The HEA has no scope to allocate additional funding to any higher education institute beyond that level derived from the free fees and RGAM allocations.

Under Article 44 of the Constitution, all parents have the right to withdraw their child from religious instruction in school.  Furthermore, under Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, a student cannot be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or, in the case of a student who is 18 or more, the student him\/herself. <\/p>  <p>  The proposed Admission to Schools Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector was established to look at how schools can cater for diversity and ensure an inclusive and respectful environment for all their pupils.  The Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum took account of the findings and conclusions of previous groups and committees, such as those of the Constitution Review Group of 1996.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to denominational religious education, the Forum Report did not recommend that religious instruction be removed from the school day, and the Advisory Group made a number of suggestions regarding practical and timetable options for religious education.  A follow-up paper to the Forum Report, entitled Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions, was published in 2014 and encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices in a number of areas, including the right to opt out of religion classes and the scheduling of such classes.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also recommended that Rule 68 of the Rules for National Schools, which referred to a religious spirit informing and vivifying the work of the school, be deleted.  Rule 68 was rescinded in January of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to strengthening parental choice and diversity in our school system, in order to ensure that it reflects the diversity of modern Ireland.

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.<\/p>  <p>  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.  The results of this examination were stark.<\/p>  <p>  The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:<\/p>  <p>- a non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,<\/p>  <p>- a lack of consistent and accurate data,<\/p>  <p>- that the current system was not tracking data flows well, and<\/p>  <p>- between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for, with widespread illegal dumping.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry through the establishment of a Tyres Working Group, the then Minister announced the decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015.  Since then, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.<\/p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax or levy under the new system being introduced; consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre.  The model that is being introduced will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply, but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to.  It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures that the existing levy is properly directed in the future, so that the consumer does not pay twice-once at the point of purchase and again, when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of drafting the regulations to underpin the new PRI scheme.  The intention is to introduce the visible Environmental Management Charge from 1 January 2017.  In addition, the recycling and recovery targets are currently being discussed by the Environment and Targets sub-group of the Tyres Working Group.  Their report will then go to the Tyres Working Group and the recommendation of the group will then come to my Department for a decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600082#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Projects","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600082#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[19923\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600082#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide funding for an organisation (details supplied) under the support scheme for national organisations, given that it scored higher than the recommended level for funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>The organisation in question submitted an application to Pobal under the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector.

These include that the person must be aged 66 or over and have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no fixed amount of paid and\/or credited contributions required which will qualify a person for a full-rate State pension (contributory).  The total amount of contributions a person will require also depends upon the duration over which they made these contributions, as both of these figures are used to calculate a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions, upon which their rate of entitlement is based.  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age). <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, if one breaks down claims based upon their banding, there are currently 225,507 State pension (contributory) claims approved  for a pension rate based upon the 100% band, and 140,218 claims for a reduced rate band pension (which includes the 98% rate).  It should be noted, however, that the rate of payment for a number of these (including some of those on the 100% band) are reduced for other reasons unrelated to banding, such as pro-rata mixed insurance pensions (where the pensioner has mixed insurance records, having worked in both the public and private sector) and pensions where the pensioner worked both in Ireland and another EU country.  These individualised various rates of reduction based on the circumstances of each pensioner mean that it is not practical to provide a breakdown of reduced rates of payment in the manner requested by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The additional cost to the Exchequer for people with a completed 40 year Social insurance contribution record qualifying for a full pension would depend on a number of factors &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - Whether the 40 years of contributions would be paid contributions, or could include credited contributions received when in receipt of another social welfare payment (such credited contributions are used in the calculation of the yearly average).<\/p>  <p>  - Whether such a pension could be claimed before age 66 (i.e. many people would have paid 40 years contributions aged 58-65).<\/p>  <p>  - How soon such pensioners accrued a 40 years contributions record.<\/p>  <p>  - The number of existing workers, currently outside the pension system, who would have 40 years of paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  - Whether such a pension could be paid to people under current pension age and still working, in addition to their wages<\/p>  <p>  - Additional net costs could potentially include people retiring early and ceasing payment of PRSI and taxes. <\/p>  <p>  Any significant measures that would increase the cost of the State pension would have to be carefully costed and considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record; the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01500"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[19999\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of extending social protection supports to the self-employed and permitting such persons to opt into the existing class A structure, paying the rate corresponding to their income level over a calendar year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>Providing a supportive environment for enterprise and employment is fundamental to achieving the Government&rsquo;s aim of job creation.  In particular, the role of entrepreneurs and the self-employed will be central to this ambition.<\/p><p>The new Programme  for a Paternship Government contains a commitment to introduce an improved PRSI scheme for the self-employed.  In addition, we will also ensure that the Earned Income Tax Credit available to the self-employed will match that available to employees, over a number of budgets.  This process commenced in Budget 2016 with the introduction of a &euro;550 tax credit for the self-employed.  I want to ensure that appropriate sustainable supports are available to the self-employed in the event of certain contingencies arising<\/p><p>The self-employed have been liable for compulsory social insurance since 1988.  The self-employed persons pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4% and are covered for the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (contributory), Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit.  Self-employed contributors will also be entitled to the new Paternity Benefit to be introduced later this year.  The schemes to which the self-employed have access to amount to &euro;6.3 billion out of a total SIF scheme spend of &euro;8.4 billion, or 75% of SIF expenditure.<\/p><p>The schemes to which the self-employed do not have access are: Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Illness Benefit, Partial Capacity Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Health and Safety Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Treatment Benefit, Occupational Injuries Benefits including Disablement Benefit.<\/p><p>The cost of extending certain short-term social insurance benefits was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010.  The report found that:<\/p><p>i. the effective annual rate of contribution required to provide the core full-rate State Pension (contributory) is approximately 15% at national average earnings.  This compares very favourably with the 4% currently paid by the self-employed.<\/p><p>ii. An incremental increase of 1% in contribution rates would be required if Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition core State Pension (contributory) is provided.<\/p><p>iii. The average contribution rate required for the core State Pension (contributory) plus the Invalidity Pension is estimated to be in the region of 2%.<\/p><p>Using a number of assumptions based on the existing population of contributors and beneficiaries, the Actuarial Review report estimated the full year incremental costs of extending Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Invalidity Pension to the self-employed, stated in 2012 terms, to be &euro;87m and &euro;78m in a full year, respectively.  This is based on two principal assumptions, namely that the incidence rate of benefit is the same as that applying to the overall population and that the extended scheme reaches full &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  It is possible, in practice that the incidence rate may be different and it is likely that the scheme will take time to reach full maturity.<\/p><p>The former Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published a report in 2013 which examined the options for extension of cover to the self-employed.  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity.<\/p><p>The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  The Group concluded that <i>&quot;extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>I intend to extend, over a period of time, the range of benefits which the self&ndash;employed can access through the social insurance system, with particular reference to providing access to benefits for long-term illness\/incapacity and treatment benefits.  My Department is currently examining the costs and financing of such an extension of benefits as well as the phasing in of access to the benefits.  This examination will have to include the level of appropriate additional contribution the self-employed should make for more benefits.<\/p><p>I look forward to making progress on this issue regarding specific proposals, as well as providing later this year a timeframe for implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Yield","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01800"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[19904\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600085#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reduction in the yield from social insurance in a calendar year if the PRSI employers rate of 8.5% was extended for employees earning up to &euro;385, &euro;390, &euro;395 and &euro;400 per week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":329,"content":"<p>Currently employers pay PRSI at the rate of 8.5% where weekly earnings are between &euro;38 and &euro;376.

","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I have been actively engaged with both the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government since the results of the recent UK-EU referendum became known.  On the Friday when the result was announced I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and the leaders of the Northern Irish political parties.<\/p>  <p>  Last Wednesday, the Secretary of State and I convened the Quarterly Review Meeting of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements, which was attended by the First and deputy First Ministers and the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and at which the referendum result was discussed.  In addition to the Review Meeting, I also held a separate bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers during which we discussed the issue, as well as with the leaders of the SDLP and Alliance Parties.<\/p>  <p>  The referendum outcome was also on the agenda at Monday&rsquo;s NSMC Plenary hosted by the Taoiseach at Dublin Castle.  My Cabinet colleagues and I participated together with the Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive led by the First and deputy First Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  During the NSMC Plenary there was a detailed discussion on the potential impact of the UK referendum result to leave the EU.  At the meeting, the NSMC agreed on ten specific areas where there would be joint planning and engagement.  Furthermore, the economy and trade; Northern Ireland and British Irish relations; the Common Travel Area; and the EU were highlighted as the four priority areas where implications arise as result of the referendum vote.<\/p>  <p>  The NSMC Plenary followed on from last week&rsquo;s Quarterly Review Meeting of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements and my separate bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers.  Naturally the outcome of the UK referendum on the EU was a key element of these meetings and I took the opportunity to assure all those present of the priority the Government attaches to the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the aftermath of the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  I emphasised the necessity and importance of working together in the best interests of the people on this island.  I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work in support of stability, reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  In this regard the Government will use its influence with our EU partners to seek to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.  In addition I outlined that the Common Travel Area and cross-border EU funding, are key priorities for the Government in the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the deep concerns and anxiety that have arisen for many people across the community in Northern Ireland about the referendum outcome.  The fact that the majority within Northern Ireland who voted to remain now face their preference being set aside as a result of the overall result across the UK raises profound issues. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, in my bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers we agreed that the Good Friday Agreement remains the foundation for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  The EU referendum result does not in any way diminish the centrality of the Good Friday Agreement or the requirement of both the British and Irish Governments to uphold it.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday and succeeding Agreements, the Irish Government is determined that its institutions, values and principles &ndash; including the right to be British or Irish or both - will be fully protected.<\/p>  <p>  I also spoke with Secretary of State Villiers bilaterally on legacy issues; both in terms of the urgent need to make progress on the establishment of the Stormont House Legacy institutions as well as a number of specific historic cases.  I raised the recent all-Party D&aacute;il Motion on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the third such motion passed by this House, and underlined the expectation of the Government and the D&aacute;il that progress on this long-standing request would be made.  We also discussed the findings of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the killings at Loughinisland which was published earlier this month. <\/p>  <p>  At the Review Meeting on 29 June, in addition to the outcome of the referendum, the participants considered the progress made on the implementation of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements.  I emphasised the importance of seeking full implementation of these Agreements and noted the continued delivery on the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Agreements, as reflected in the Programme for Government.  This includes, a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million already committed, and &euro;2.5 million provided by the Government for the North West Development Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The review meeting also welcomed the publication of the Panel report on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland as required under the Fresh Start Agreement, and welcomed that the Executive&rsquo;s Action Plan building on its recommendations will be finalised soon.  The meeting also noted the work between the two Governments on an international treaty to provide for the establishment of the Independent Reporting Commission which will monitor progress on ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600088#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Data","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600088#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[19994\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600088#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the average waiting time for a passport application or renewal to be processed and finalised; the extent to which the new demand for passports following the British vote to exit the European Union has affected the processing time; the number of additional applications for passports estimated to be applied for as a result of the referendum; if he has allocated additional resources to the Passport Office to enable it cope with the extra demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>As of 4 July, there were a total of 50,055 applications in the passport system.  This is down from 68,000 applications in hand approximately at the end of May and the turnaround times for passport renewals and first-time applications have improved.  The level of demand remains very high this year with an 11% rise in the number of applications year-to-date compared to the same period last year.  In this context I would point to the notable increase in outbound travel from Ireland this year which is another factor driving demand.<\/p><p>In the case of Passport Express renewal applications, which account for around 90% of all applications in the state, applicants are advised to allow 15 working days.  Correctly completed applications currently have a turnaround time of 12\/13 working days.  First time applications take longer due to additional measures to verify identity and citizenship entitlement and applicants are advised to allow 20 working days.  The current turnaround time for first time passport applications is 18\/19 days.<\/p><p>To respond to the seasonal spike in demand and the more general increase in applications, a total of 233 Temporary Clerical Officers have been recruited so far this year.  This is an increase of 62 officers on last year.  The officers are assisting permanent staff with passport entitlement checking and customer care, including the response to queries received via phone calls, emails and social media.<\/p><p>Since the UK referendum result there has been a notable increase in queries concerning Irish passports and citizenship from Northern Ireland, Great Britain and elsewhere.  Statistics relating to passport applications are released on a monthly basis.  In the month of June this year there were 7,045 applications in total from Northern Ireland and 5,719 applications from Great Britain.  These represent increases of 9.5% and 20.5% respectively over the same month in 2015.  However, the absolute numbers need to be taken in context as the Passport Service issued over 670,000 passports last year.  It is too early as yet to identify the precise impact of the outcome of the referendum in terms of the volume of passport applications from the United Kingdom and the extent to which any initial increase will be sustained.<\/p><p>I would like to underline that there is no need for concern in terms of freedom of movement or entitlement to an Irish passport.  The process of negotiation to enable the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is likely to take two years as envisaged under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and once the article is triggered.  During this period, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union and its citizens continue to enjoy full rights including freedom of movement within the EU.  At the same time, the referendum has not in any way changed the entitlement to an Irish passport including as it extends to those people born on the island of Ireland and those with Irish citizenship through parents or grandparents born in Ireland.<\/p><p>I would urge people who have concerns about freedom of movement within the European Union and British nationals who are interested in applying for an Irish passport for the first time to get the full facts and research their particular situation before contacting the Passport Service.  Detailed information on passport entitlements and procedures is available on the website of the Department at <i>www.dfa.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>While there has not been a significant impact on passport services so far from the UK referendum outcome, at least in terms of the overall number of passport applications, my Department will continue to closely monitor the situation.  Passport Service staff and other resources will be re-deployed as needed to deal with an increase in applications, if sustained.  The need for additional resources will be kept under active review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600088#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[20067\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of appointments he has made to State boards since the move to the Public Appointments Service two years ago to date; the names of those appointed and the relevant position on each board; the names of those persons on the short-list; the date when the short-list was provided to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>There are no State boards under the aegis of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Data","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[20437\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide information on the number of persons of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds currently working in his Department and in other public service organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The management of public expenditure has played an important role in ensuring that these key fiscal targets have been achieved.  The EU Commission has recommended that Ireland has met the requirements to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact at the end of 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Public Service Reform was a key element of the Government's response to the crisis and the strategy for recovery.  The reforms implemented over the past five years enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.  A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  While the economy is recovering, the need to ensure that public expenditure increases are sustainable means that reform of the Public Service will continue to be a priority in 2016 and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2015 marked the point where expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets.  Gross voted expenditure has grown by an average of 2&frac12;% annually in since the end of 2014.  The fiscal projections in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) are consistent with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to spend at least &euro;6.75 billion more on public services in 2021 compared to 2016.  Investment in public infrastructure is vital for the medium and long-term competitiveness of the economy as well as for underpinning social cohesion through the provision of vital services to the public such as schools, public transport and housing.  A cumulative additional &euro;5.1 billion is allocated to capital spending in the SES over the period to 2021, in addition to the increases set out in the Public Capital Plan published in September last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600089#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600090#WRS00400"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[20036\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600090#WRS00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he and his Department have examined the full implications of a British exit from the European Union, if any particular corrective measures are likely to be required in its aftermath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>My Department has been taking part in the work of the Interdepartmental Group on EU\/UK relations which was convened by the Department of the Taoiseach in advance of the UK Referendum on EU membership, as well as the EU Senior Officials' Group that is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis facing the country and the fiscal consolidation measures required to restore our finances, the contribution made by public servants has been very significant and it is a contribution that I wish to acknowledge.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to delivering on monetary targets, a number of reforms and changes to work practices, such as additional working hours, have been implemented since 1 July 2013.  Approximately 15 million additional hours have been provided by staff right across the Public Service.  These reforms have contributed to the maintenance and enhancement of existing public services during a period of significant constraints on public expenditure and at a time when public services were under increasing demand.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the difficult measures adopted and the resulting improvement in the economy, the Government has, through the negotiation and agreement of a financially prudent public service agreement on pay and related issues, provided for a gradual unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts as they apply to public servants.  The terms of this agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement, are being implemented under the FEMPI Act 2015 at a full year cost of &euro;844m to 2018.  All public servants covered by the Agreement will benefit, for example a public servant earning &euro;30,000 will receive an extra &euro;2,170 under the agreement.  Importantly the Agreement secures and extends the productivity improvements under the Haddington Road Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The continued improvement in our fiscal position has also allowed for targeted recruitment in 2015 and 2016 to fill critical gaps in public service numbers, due to the recruitment moratorium, and meet additional staffing requirements in frontline services related to demographic change.  In total since Q4 2013, the Government has approved to the end of 2016 the recruitment of an additional 18,100 public servants to meet demands for enhanced public service delivery at a cost of an extra &euro;1.1bn to our paybill over three years.  These include 4,300 Teachers; 1,500 Special Needs Assistants 1,700 Nurses and over 1,000 consultants\/doctors\/dentists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600090#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600090#WRS01200"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[20040\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600090#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which changes in procurement have benefitted the economy during the downturn; if any further reform appropriate to the recovery is warranted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>Procurement reform is a key element of the Government's overall reform programme and is aimed at delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.

This was not sustainable, as the State could afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the efficient delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.

However, the postal sector is undergoing significant change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in core mail volume decline year on year.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the changing commercial environment, the previous Government established the Post Office Network Business Development Group, the remit of which was to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network.  Mr. Bobby Kerr was appointed as the independent chairman of the group and he brought a depth of knowledge and experience in identifying and developing business opportunities for the post office network.<\/p>  <p>  The final report of the group, which was published in January of this year, details 23 recommendations - with network renewal, a basic payment account and motor tax being the three key actions.  The final report recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.<\/p>  <p>  A number of working groups have also been established, including a network renewal implementation group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr.  This group is examining the number and spatial distribution of branches, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts and training and qualifications for post office employees.  An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, are members of the group, which is of fundamental importance to the long-term future of the network.  While good progress has been made to date, the group&rsquo;s work remains on-going.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to acting on the recommendations of the final report, including supporting the implementation of a basic payment account and enabling the payment of motor tax through the post office network.  Responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in the final report has recently transferred to my Department, along with a number of staff with expertise on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with Mr Kerr with a view to finalising a timeframe for the conclusion of the work of the network renewal implementation group and the implementation of the recommendations, which will refresh, renew and reinvent the Post Office Network and ensure its sustainability into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600092#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600092#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[19992\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600092#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the role she envisages for local authorities in the roll out of rural broadband; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1265","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>Local Authorities will have a key role to play in the roll out of Rural Broadband.

It is important to stress that any such scheme must meet certain specific criteria laid down by Rural Development Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  As regards formulating the design of the scheme as well as its potential operation, my Department has met the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association as well as other farming organisations and has received the email referred to by the Deputy.  Furthermore officials of my Department met last week with officials of the European Commission to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the Rural Development Programme.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on the details of the scheme in light of these consultations.  It is clear that any scheme must meet the specific requirements of the Rural Development Regulations whereby farmers may only be compensated for any actions they undertake on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone.  Furthermore, in any scheme where farmers must undertake actions, those actions must go beyond the normal standards of husbandry practice before they can be considered as an eligible cost incurred by a farmer.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that I am very much cognisant of the need to ensure that a scheme takes into account the different production systems in the Irish sheep flock and recognises the different challenges facing both lowland flocks and hill flocks whilst at the same time it must be acceptable to the European Commission in the context of the requirements of the Rural Development Programme.  The submissions of all farm organisations are important in this regard.  It is my aim that this scheme will deliver tangible benefits to the sheep sector in terms of its impact to on- farm practices whilst maximising the number of participants.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability of the sheep sector in Ireland including those involved in farming hill sheep.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[19971\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his proposals to the European Union Agriculture Commissioner relating to the urgent need to provide additional support for the dairy sector following the Commissioner's statement (details supplied) that the provision of further support for that sector is justified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>I am acutely conscious of the pressure farmers are under at present, and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to exploring all of the appropriate options for providing assistance to the farm sector through current difficulties.<\/p><p>Volatility in the dairy sector is a global issue to which a cohesive response is essential.  Therefore, it is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.<i><\/i>Having discussed issues with national stakeholders, I am currently working with Commissioner Hogan and other EU Ministers with a view to finding pragmatic, realistic and workable solutions to these ongoing difficulties.<\/p><p><i><\/i>I believe our focus must remain on providing real, practical and immediate assistance for farmers.  In addition to intervention, I have called for the deployment of other measures that will provide real benefit for farmers in the short-term in particular, the bringing forward of the delivery date for direct payments.  Such a measure will be of immediate assistance to farmers in acting as a source of immediate cash-flow and a buffer to ongoing volatility.<\/p><p>I have also asked the Commissioner to consider the deployment of a further targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September.  The September package gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure, with appropriate flexibility could play a further important role in 2016.<\/p><p>A number of other market support measures have been put in place at EU level, including an increase in the ceiling for SMP intervention to 350,000 tonnes, which was sought by Ireland.  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers.<\/p><p>I agree that we should continue to look at all means of assisting farmers.  But in doing so we should focus on direct and practical measures, and avoid taking any action that would in any way compromise their long-term prospects.<\/p><p>A prolonged period of volatility in dairy markets has been in evidence in recent times.  However it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  How we mitigate the current volatility is the challenge. \u00a0Volatility in dairy markets is a global problem, an EU problem and an Irish problem for which there is no single silver bullet.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  In this respect we must continue to work with industry and the financial services sector at a national level to ensure resilience is built into the sector in the current period of volatility and going forward, strengthening our position within the global market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[19976\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600096#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when he will issue a payment to a person (details supplied) under the Scottish derogation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie <\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.<\/p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.<\/p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. \u00a0Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map\u00a0should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to\u00a0<i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>Over\u00a0750,000 premises are the focus\u00a0for the\u00a0procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I announced that my Department\u00a0has also identified a further\u00a0170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  The intention is\u00a0to undertake further analysis on these additional premises with a view to including them\u00a0in the formal procurement process.<\/p><p>I also announced yesterday (5 July) that the Department has now moved to the next stage in the procurement process.  In this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, three\u00a0qualifying bidders have been invited to meet with the Department to commence the formal dialogue process.  The qualifying bidders will shortly be furnished with a draft contract, with detailed specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. <\/p><p>Following the ITPD stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue\u00a0final tender documentation to bidders.\u00a0\u00a0When final tenders have been submitted\u00a0a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots\u00a0as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal\u00a0contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.  There has been no delay in the process since I took office.  The timing of each stage of the procurement is however dependent on a number of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process.<\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional,\u00a0Rural and\u00a0Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.\u00a0 In this regard, Minister Humphreys\u00a0is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600097#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600097#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[20062\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600097#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of appointments he has made to State boards since the move to use the Public Appointments Service two years ago to date; the names of those appointed and the relevant position on each board; the names of those persons on the short-list; the date when the short-list was provided to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>There have been 6 appointments to State Boards under the aegis of my Department in the period 6 May 2016 to date.\u00a0 All of the appointments were made in accordance with the Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards which were published by the Department of Expenditure and Reform\u00a0in November 2014.<\/p><p>The following table sets out the information requested by the Deputy.

The sectors in the regions targeted in the plan include manufacturing, tourism, food and energy.  Actions to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include:<\/p>  <p>  - A series of actions to promote 25% more start-ups in the midlands, including extra funding, mentoring programmes and establishing new incubator spaces for entrepreneurs like Offaly Innovation Centre (The Junction) in Tullamore;<\/p>  <p>  - A series of actions aimed at attracting at least 25 additional multinational investment projects to the region by 2019, including building two advance facilities for Athlone, appointing an IDA Regional Manager for the midlands and actions to ensure that key IDA personnel overseas have enhanced knowledge and marketing plans for the region;<\/p>  <p>  - A series of actions to support extra employment growth in the 1052 existing exporting companies within the midlands region, most of which are SMEs;<\/p>  <p>  - Establishing a Midlands manufacturing technologies campus.<\/p>  <p>  While Enterprise Ireland cannot support the company concerned in line with national policy on tobacco control, in terms of job creation in the Midlands and in Mullingar in particular, Enterprise Ireland is focussed on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its client portfolio.

Each year the HSA carry out a two week intensive farm inspection campaign in April and this year over 500 inspections were carried out.  Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  HSA inspectors have participated in over 50 farm safety walks and presentations to farmers, many of which are organised by the farming representative bodies.  This has enabled HSA to direct its message to over 2000 farmers.<\/p><p>I am particularly concerned at the high level of farm fatalities and it goes without saying that safety in agriculture continues to be a high priority for the Health and Safety Authority and for the Government.  The Health and Safety Authority has sought, in consultation with the Farm Safety Partnership -<i><\/i>an advisory committee of the Authority that includes representatives from a wide range of key farming stakeholders - to broaden the type of contact with farmers and to find the most effective means to spread the message of prevention within the farming community.<\/p><p>This week I was present at the launch of the Farm Safety Action Plan 2016-18 at the Teagasc Beef 2016 event in Grange, Co Meath.  This new Action Plan lays out a series of specific actions and priorities over the next three years for tackling the high rates of illness, injury and death on Irish farms.  It sets out six major goals as follows:<\/p><p>1). To achieve cultural behavioural change in health and safety of persons working in the agricultural sector through Research, Education and Training.<\/p><p>2). To develop programmes which will foster Innovative Approaches and deliver Engineering Solutions to reduce the risks to persons working in Agriculture.<\/p><p>3). To reduce the level of death and injury arising from Tractor and Machinery use.<\/p><p>4). To establish initiatives to reduce the level of death and injuries arising from working with Livestock.<\/p><p>5). To ensure high standards of health and safety are adopted in Forestry and Timber work on farms.<\/p><p>6). To implement programmes for the protection of health and wellbeing of persons, including vulnerable groups, working in Agriculture.<\/p><p>I commend the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Farm Safety Partnership on their support for the 2016 Farm Safety Week 4 to 8 July.  This is the fourth annual Farm Safety Week, an initiative launched in 2013 aiming to cut the toll of accidents which continue to give agriculture the poorest record of any occupation in Ireland.  I particularly welcome this joint initiative which brings together the farming organisations from North and South and from the United Kingdom as well as the UK Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive, the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive for Northern Ireland and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority, Ireland.<\/p><p>In November 2015, BeSMART - the free online risk assessment and safety statement tool developed by the Authority -  was extended to the agri&ndash;business sector, facilitating easy compliance with requirements and raising awareness of a risk based approach to health and safety.<\/p><p>Finally, the advisory and enforcement activity of the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority complements the suite of programmes developed and implemented by the Department of Agriculture.  For example, the Farm Safety Scheme 2014-2015 made over &euro;12 million available in grant-aid to improve the standard of safety on Irish farms for a number of specified investment items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600098#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Data","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600099#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[20439\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600099#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide information on the number of persons of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds currently working in her Department and in other public service organisations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>Recruitment to my Department is undertaken principally by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) through competitions advertised publicly, setting out the competencies required for general civil service posts and technical\/professional posts as appropriate.
