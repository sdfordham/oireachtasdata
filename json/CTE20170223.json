We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.<\/p>  <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Marc MacSharry.<\/p>  <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 15 and 16 February 2017 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I do not think any particular matter arises from the minutes.  If there is we can discuss the matter under any other business.  <\/p>  <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  No. 297A is a briefing document from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for today&rsquo;s meeting.   Is it agreed that we note and publish it?  Agreed. <\/p>  <p>  No. 312A is an opening statement from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.   We will note and publish that.<\/p>  <p>  Category B correspondence is from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings.  The first item, since the last meeting, is correspondence dated 6 February 2017 from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This is a follow-up to the appearance of the Department and Tusla before the committee on 19 January 2017.  We will note and publish that.  People are free to make comments once the correspondence is published.  <\/p>  <p>  No. 300B is correspondence dated 16  February 2017 from Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, An Ceann Comhairle, regarding the staff resources and the PAC secretariat.  As we dealt with this matter in private session yesterday we can note the matter. <\/p>  <p>  No. 301B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills regarding the production of financial statements at the National College of Art and Design.  The correspondence states that the college is working with the Comptroller and Auditor General and that while there are ongoing compliance issues the Department is confident that these issues will be rectified in the near future.  I am sure through the natural course of the examination of the accounts and statements laid weekly we can keep an eye out for this.  We will watch and monitor the matter as we go along.<\/p>  <p>  No. 302B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the presentation of the 2012 and 2013 financial statements for The Gathering Project 2013 Limited.  They were laid on the 2 February and were noted by the committee at last week's meeting.   We will note the correspondence.  <\/p>  <p>  No. 303B is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, Director General of the HSE.  The letter recommends that before the Department and the HSE are before the Committee on 9 March 2017, to discuss the fair deal scheme, that the committee visit a public residential community facility.  Would any member like to comment on the invitation that is worthy of consideration?  We have received a letter from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien who has suggested that when considering this matter we should look at some of the State nursing homes and see how a good one operates.  I note that he has recommended we visit a place in Mountmellick, County Laois.  Perhaps it is a coincidence but the place is located in my area.  Maybe it is not a coincidence.  I do not know.   Mr. O'Brien has a point.  We must get a proper feeling of what is provided in HSE institutions versus what is provided in nursing homes.<\/p> <p>We know HSE institutions have a lot of people that the nursing homes do not cater for.  If we are evaluating them strictly on a cost basis and on value for money we have to take into account the quality of the service being provided.  I think that is what is behind that particular letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300003#B00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487840700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I certainly welcome that because the level of dependency that I have seen in public nursing homes in Galway and in the county, when we had one in Galway, was extraordinary.

The reason for this is a decision by the HSE to close that unit.  In all published documentation, it is listed as the most expensive unit in the country per patient per week.  I think we should have a short visit there.  The level of patients in it has diminished dramatically but the cost structure is very high.  It think it would give a good balance.

The Deputy is happy to note that.<\/p>  <p>  That is correspondence received.  The next item is on reports and statements of account received since the last meeting.  I will open up this particular topic by acknowledging a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published on this issue during the week, that is, Special Report No. 95, financial reporting in the public sector.  It was published on 21 February 2017.  It was completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the timeliness of financial reporting in the public sector.  Most public sector bodies are required to have their accounts prepared within three months.  Two thirds of all bodies missed that deadline.  That is 200 out of approximately 300.  We are not talking about the direct line Departments, which meet the deadlines for annual audit and the appropriations account.<\/p> <p>It is to do with the bodies and I have therefore asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce a list of those on a Department-by-Department basis to see which Departments are the principal offenders.  We will then call in those Accounting Officers.  The Department of Health one, due to the establishment of the ETBs, was a set-up situation so there are understandably quite a lot of delays in that area.  Notwithstanding that, the education sector has been a particular problem.  I do not believe the Accounting Officers have paid sufficient attention to this area.  They come in looking for money for public bodies every year and they have no idea why they are not in the audited accounts that have already been submitted in respect of prior years.  Our committee will be putting down a marker on that.  It is directly related to the report, Financial Reporting in the Public Sector, which was published only two days ago.  <\/p> <p> The Comptroller and Auditor General might say a few brief words on this topic to which we will return as we have a special report on it.  We will not discuss it today but I just want to highlight it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300004#C02700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487841300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Yes.

This relates to the 2014 year of account.  I will try to update it for 2015 so the committee will have up-to-date information.  I will also try to replicate that reporting annually in order that a focus can be kept on this.  The committee, ourselves and the audited bodies have succeeded in bringing forward the financial report and progress has been made.  I would like to put that on the record.  Even further progress has been made in 2016 but we are still in a situation where many bodies are quite late in completing the financial reporting process.

The 2015 appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport received a clear audit opinion, with no material issues arising for reporting.  The account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.73 billion in 2015.  Receipts into the Vote totalled &euro;406 million, &euro;370 million of which was accounted for by a transfer of funding from the local government fund, which the committee will be aware is substantially funded by motor taxation receipts.<\/p>  <p>  The gross Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across five expenditure programmes, as outlined in the diagram on screen.  The bulk of the spend was under the Department&rsquo;s land transport programme, accounting for 81% of its total expenditure.  I understand that the Accounting Officer will provide more detail on the programme expenditure in his opening remarks.<\/p>  <p>  Just under 85% of the Vote expenditure related to funding provided to other public bodies in the form of current and capital funding.  A number of the bodies are significant grant awarding bodies in their own right.  I have prepared a diagram which is on the next page of my statement - it might be put up the screen - which tries to summarise and categorise the bodies under the aegis of the Department.  I will explain the diagram.<\/p>  <p>  A number of the bodies the Department overseas are within my audit remit and so there are reports on the financial statements of those bodies and they come before the committee.  The more substantial ones that fall into that category are Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Sport Ireland.  All of those are substantial grant awarding bodies in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are other bodies under the aegis of the Department which are substantially funded by the Department for their operations or which are regulators.  All of those come within my remit, for instance, the Road Safety Authority, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the Commission for Railway Regulation, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.<\/p> <p>Funding is also provided from the Vote to Tourism Ireland Limited.  This is an all-Ireland body that was set up under the 1998 agreement which is audited by me in conjunction with my equivalent in Northern Ireland.  It also receives funding in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> Then there is a set of commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department that are not audited by me - members will be familiar with that - and therefore do not directly fall within the remit of the committee either.  These include the CIE Group, the harbour boards, Dublin Airport Authority, the Shannon Group and the Irish Aviation Authority.  I also pointed out that there is funding from the Department to Sport Ireland and through it to national sports governing bodies and local sports clubs and so on.  Again, they are not audited by me but, depending on the scale of the funding, I may have inspection rights.<\/p> <p> Finally I draw attention in the diagram to the existence of the Irish Coast Guard, which is part of the Department.  It is an agency within it.  I prepared the diagram because I thought there were quite a number of bodies and it might be helpful to the committee to understand the relationship between the bodies and the Department. <\/p> <p> On the Vote outturn for 2015, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved a Supplementary Estimate of a net &euro;100 million for Vote 31 in November 2015.  This was mainly to allow additional capital funding for investment in roads, rail and light rail networks and bus fleet.  At the year end, a net &euro;22 million remained unspent.  The sum of &euro;16.1 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2016 with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result, just under &euro;6 million was liable for surrender at the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300006#E03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487842500,"counter":104,"content":"<p>At this stage, I call on Mr. Graham Doyle to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300007#F00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487842500,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I have provided members with a detailed briefing on the 2015 appropriation account which is the subject of today&rsquo;s hearing.  My Department was not the subject of focus in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2015 so the briefing the committee has describes spending programmes across the entire Vote.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, the Department&rsquo;s overall gross expenditure was &euro;1.6 billion.  Our final outturn for the year, thanks to a Supplementary Estimate, was over &euro;1.7 billion.  The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided between five main expenditure programmes and the administrative budget.  As Deputies will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis which we oversee in accordance with the code of practice for the corporate governance of State bodies.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for the diagram, which is very helpful this morning.  Much of the funding within this Vote is channelled through these State agencies and, as pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, they are audited separately in terms of that expenditure.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, 80% of the Vote went towards the land transport programme, at almost &euro;1.3 billion.  This programme provides for spending in the area of roads and public transport.  The roads programme spent almost &euro;730 million, covering national, regional and local roads as well as PPP operational payments.  The bulk of this funding is spent on the maintenance and upkeep of our road network, with some limited funding for new road developments.<br\/><br\/>Investment in the public transport infrastructure totalled almost &euro;340 million that year, including Luas Cross City works.  That project is still on target for completion of works and commencement of services this year.  Funding was also provided to the National Transport Authority for PSO buses for the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets and for the continued implementation of various programmes around sustainable travel, traffic management, regional cities and accessibility grants.  The public transport subhead also provides capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann primarily for maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network nationwide under the multi-annual infrastructure manager contract, IMMAC.  In 2015, &euro;209 million was committed towards public service obligation for public transport services.  This was the first time since the fiscal crisis that funding was maintained rather than decreased.  Subsequent budgets for 2016 and 2017 have seen the level of public service obligation funding increase substantially.<br\/><br\/>The tourism services programme, accounted for 8%<b>, <\/b>or &euro;120 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  This comprises the programme and administrative spend of the two tourism agencies, that is, F&aacute;ilte Ireland at &euro;56 million and Tourism Ireland at &euro;15 million, as well as the tourism marketing fund at &euro;34 million and the tourism product development programme at &euro;13 million.  At the time, 2015 was a record year for visitor numbers to Ireland, with a total of 8.6 million visitors, an increase of almost 14% on 2014.  These trends have continued.  In 2015, a tourism policy - People, Place and Policy - was launched which set ambitious goals for the sector to 2025.  The year 2015 also saw the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, building on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It is clear that Brexit presents a particular challenge to the tourism sector.  Over recent months, we have been working very closely with the tourism agencies and tourism stakeholders to ensure Ireland is positioned well to address these challenges.<br\/><br\/>The maritime transport and safety programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;91 million, of the Vote in 2015.  The main expenditure programme here relates to supports to the Irish Coast Guard at &euro;76 million.  In 2015, the Coast Guard responded to over 2,600 incidents and the search and rescue helicopters were tasked over 1,000 times.  The year 2015 also saw significant progress in the modernisation of equipment and processes within the Coast Guard, including a new IT-based incident logging system within the three rescue co-ordination centres.  This new system has greatly improved operational effectiveness and efficiency within the centres.<br\/><br\/>The sports and recreation services programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;90 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  The programme supported the Irish Sports Council and National Sports Campus, at &euro;57 million.  Both have since merged to form Sport Ireland.  We provide funding to the sports capital programme and the swimming pools programme.  During 2015, significant progress was made in the development of facilities at the National Sport Campus, including work on the development of a new high performance centre, a new multi-purpose campus conference centre.  Work also commenced on the National Indoor Arena which has since been completed.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, the gross expenditure provision for the aviation programme was &euro;26 million, or 2%, of the Vote.  The largest beneficiary of the funding is the regional airports programme, at &euro;12 million.  This programme also covers costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol and subscriptions to other international organisations.  The year 2015 saw the publication of the national aviation policy following significant stakeholder consultations.  A key element of the policy was the subsequent establishment of a National Aviation Development Forum which had its first annual conference last Monday. <br\/><br\/>Finally, the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget, at &euro;34 million, represents 1.7% of overall spend.  It covers pay costs for the Department&rsquo;s staff of around 450 in 2015 and administrative overheads such as IT, travel, utilities and accommodation services.<br\/><br\/>Over recent years, the Department has been proactive in developing new policy responses across its remit on a strong evidence basis.  I have mentioned a number of these already.  However, a particularly important piece of evidence-based policy was the strategic framework for investment in land transport, which we call the SFILT, that was published in August 2015.  This strategic framework considered what role transport needs to play in the future development of the economy and to estimate the appropriate level of investment in the land transport system.  The evidence analysis provided important inputs to the existing capital plan and it will also inform our input to the review of that plan which was announced earlier this month.<br\/><br\/>I hope that this opening statement has provided the committee with a broad overview of the expenditure areas under my remit and that it has been helpful to the committee as it examines the 2015 appropriation account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487842500,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle for his opening statement.

Does the Department look at that scheme in terms of varying the scheme depending the wealth of an area and its ability to come up with matching funding, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300012#L00900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487845500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Is this specifically in relation to the sports capital programme and the funding grants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300012#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487845500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300012#L01100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487845500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy will be aware that the current call for submissions in regard to that closes tomorrow.

The requirement for matching funding in that regard, which was the first part of the Deputy's question, is about 5%.  It is a relatively small percentage, which I appreciate can be difficult to raise, and I know that clubs raise it in a variety of ways from particular sponsorship lump sums, from fundraising activities or whatever.

I am actually praising the Government on this matter.  The document states the framework will address matters, including \"Promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas including measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the necessity of adaptation to climate change\".  It sounds wonderful.  The reality is far from wonderful, despite all these lovely documents.  In fact, for Galway city, there is an N6 project - another road.  This is under the Department's watch, where we have one window of opportunity in regard to climate change.  This is the last D&aacute;il that will come up with meaningful action on climate change.  Otherwise, it is too late.  That is what all of the non-governmental organisations are telling us.  Yet the solution in Galway is a road.  All the public transport elements have been tagged onto it.  In fact, only yesterday the news was that they have now delayed the public consultation period for the N6 project because of the massive volumes of submissions.  I predict that the vast amount of those submissions state: \"Please, do not go ahead with a road, please, go public transport and please, go light rail.\"  That is my longest question and I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300013#M02900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487846100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>In regard to Galway, I will not go into the various things of which I am aware and which have been done in recent times, including bike schemes, reorganisation of some of the bus network in Galway and a 12% increase in bus use in Galway in the last couple of years.  These are positives but Galway needs better solutions.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's comments on strategies.  To specifically address the Deputy's comment that a big part of the solution is a road, Galway, of the cities around the country, is the one city that really has not had a relief road, bypass or something that takes cars out of the centre.  There are very few people who I encounter who are more adamant about public transport versus roads than the people on the National Transport Authority.  My understanding is that they are supportive of the concept of a road in this case because it allows for greater public transport use through the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300013#M03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487846100,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Mr. Doyle is correct.  That is what they tell us.  I have a completely different point of view.  It is based on 17 years of going down a cul de sac in regard to an outer bypass with millions of euro spent on it.  Then we go forward with a road.  It is not an outer bypass; it is a ring-road.  The public transport elements are tagged on to it.  There is no paradigm shift here on the part of the Department and certainly on the part of the officials in Galway, on the reality that we cannot go on building roads.  In regard to the road, the evidence is that more than 90% of the cars want to go into the city because that is where the industry, the university, the GMIT, the hospitals, etc., are.  We need public transport.<\/p> <p>The Department needs to examine its policies in regard to reducing emissions in the context of climate change and to develop a policy around reducing the volume of traffic on our roads in that context also.  The Department has a responsibility to do that.  Even if the road was the solution it cannot be built in the near future.  An increase in school transport provision for the pupils of the 30 to 35 schools in this 2 km zone would reduce the volume of traffic on this road.  I am sure the response to that proposal will be that school transport is a matter for another Department.  However, it is one solution.  <\/p> <p> We must insist on public mobility plans in every industry and institution.  The bicycle scheme mentioned is very limited.  I am a cyclist.  The scheme is tourism rather than commuter based.  While it is welcome, it is limited in terms of what it can achieve.  The philosophy appears to be one of add on public transport but keep going the road. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300013#M03100","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487846700,"counter":311,"content":"<p>While the Deputy has made a good point that issue is more relevant to the transport committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300014#N00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1487846700,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane mentioned that funding for the free travel scheme was frozen in 2010.

When did someone within the Department first discover that in the context of the deal done with Norwegian Airlines to fly into Ireland, which is being announced as we speak and which is welcome in a broad sense, the majority of the flights would be in and out of Dublin?  This has been going on for 15 months.  There was a good announcement for Cork today but the fact is that it was hung off the concept that the flights would be in and out of Cork.  In fact, for 15 months, all we heard about was Cork.  I understand that what has been announced today is that there will be 12 flights for Dublin, six flights for Belfast, four flights for Shannon and three flights for Cork.  As far as I am concerned, this is a Trojan horse.  I welcome the fact that they are coming into this country and the fact that we will have our first ever transatlantic flights out of Cork as opposed to the other airports.

There might not be much material but I would appreciate it if we could receive it.  The DAA, which is an agency under the remit of the Department, sold a project that was then supported for bringing transatlantic flights to Cork.  What we have today is an announcement that is effectively part of an agenda to bring a third terminal to Dublin.  Coincidentally, the Minister announced a few days ago that a study into a third terminal would take place.  What we have here is a strangulation of the other airports.  After today, I have no confidence in the board of the DAA.  By using Cork as a Trojan horse, the DAA has effectively pushed up passenger numbers for Dublin.  I welcome the fact that Norwegian Airlines is being brought in but the way this was done needs to be investigated.  We need to get to the bottom of what was really going on here.  If you look at projections for all other airports in this country, from 2012 to now, Dublin has gone from 81% to 86% of all passengers while all other airports have gone down.  Mr. Doyle has a very good knowledge of this area.  I want to find out how long this was going on.

Being a rural Deputy, I am aware of the importance of such services.  I come from Kilkenny.  Expressway services are important for connectivity in rural Ireland.  We have PSO lines, many of which go to Dublin.  The format for Expressway should be changed.  I am speaking about the south east.  I accept a bus starting in Waterford, stopping in Kilkenny and Carlow and going straight to Dublin is an express bus but, as Deputy Cullinane said, I do not accept a bus that starts in Waterford and stops in Ballyhale, Mullinavat, Paulstown and Gowran, which are all little towns in Kilkenny, and connects up the whole way is an express bus.  This involves nine stops.  That is not an express bus.  That is a different criterion and the sooner the NTA or the Minister - whoever is in charge of this - changes the statement that it is an express bus, the better.  It is not an express bus.  I can understand an express bus involving getting on in one place, having two stops and then heading on to Dublin.  The reason I am saying this is because of the PSO.  My understanding is that under the law, we cannot subsidise an Expressway route but if the criteria were changed, it could be looked at.  Due to the ongoing negotiations and the possible breakdown of the talks between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions, I fear that we will lose services in rural Ireland.  The Minister needs to meet the parties.  I know the matter has nothing to do with the Department.<\/p> <p>The Minister must get these people around the table.  He must get in representatives of the National Transport Authority, the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann and sit around the table with them.  The free travel is another issue.  It has been frozen since 2010.  Figures were mentioned and that can be looked at.  At least half the money could be got from those and the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann could work out the other problems they have.  Can the witness influence this so that connectivity can be kept in rural Ireland in order to keep it alive?  The Government is talking about keeping rural Ireland alive but unless people have services every day to go to colleges, the airport or shopping, we will see more isolation, particularly with older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300017#Q03000","speaker":"1368","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487849100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>On the structure, a number of years ago when this was being set up, there were what were seen as public service obligation, PSO, services that were socially necessary but economically unviable.  They were dealt with through what is called a direct award contract.  The package of services within that is open to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to contract with the operator, or Bus &Eacute;ireann in the case of many of its services.  It provides funding or subsidy to enable those services to operate.  The services mentioned by the Deputy as going through a number of towns - which they do in many cases - were presented by Bus &Eacute;ireann as commercial services.  At the time they were profitable and would not have received subvention.  I explained to Deputy Cullinane earlier that the National Transport Authority licences those services.  It does not require Bus &Eacute;ireann to make the stops that it does and it is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to seek revision of those licence conditions in terms of where a bus stops and taking into account where other operators stop.<\/p>  <p>  If Bus &Eacute;ireann decides to do that, to the extent that those services were covering a public service or a need for a public service, it is open to the NTA to bring about a solution that prevents people who need those public services from being denied them.  It does that in a number of ways.  It can extend existing PSO services in some instances to backfill the service.  It can make changes in some of the rural transport programme to provide the services or it can tender services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann or somebody else could apply for those.  That is how it would be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300018#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487849100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>All those services were in place when the old road structure was there.

The NTA has refused more licences in this regard than it has accepted over recent years.  There are large chunks of the public who want to travel on direct services.  At this point the market has grown to the extent that there are approximately 23 million passenger journeys on commercial services, of which Bus &Eacute;ireann at this point accounts for approximately 30%.  The market has grown very significantly and we see many more people travelling on public transport as a result of that measure.  If this results in a position where Bus &Eacute;ireann can no longer serve towns that must be served, there is a mechanism that can be used.

In terms of the planning and development of metro north and its integration with other transport services within the greater Dublin area the capacity should be front and centre in any consideration of platform length, tunnel capacity, access and egress to those underground stations and other such measures.  It is all well and good to talk about the savings to the Exchequer, which is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts exists, but it is also important to recognise that if we do not build in capacity, at a future point we would end up spending vast sums later in the process on extra carriages but also in terms of ancillary exits and access points for emergency purposes and for general access to stations.

In the context of developing other sports and in looking at strategies for the likes of National Sports Campus Development Authority and the potential investment across the range of services provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department must not just be about sport and transport but must also look at the tourism potential of sport.<\/p>  <p>  For example, 600 million people in India watched a match that was televised in Malahide a couple of years ago.  These are markets we are simply unaware of.  This sport is considered a minority sport in Ireland and yet it has incredible reach.  Cricket in Ireland is about to go up a level in the league structure, which offers incredible potential to Ireland to put its foot in the door of the super league of cricket internationally.  Despite this, we do not have a national stadium or arena for the development of the sport.  Cricket Ireland has quadrupled its membership in four years.  We are talking about an explosion in support, and not just in the north of Dublin.  It is also happening elsewhere.  There is an active cricket club in each of the 32 counties in the island of Ireland.  This should be considered by the Department.  I appreciate the Chairman's leeway to me, but I believe the Department should consider this in terms of future planning whenever the policy decision might arise.

The cities seem to do quite poorly when these grants are allocated.  When the figures are set out on a per capita basis, Dublin, Cork and Limerick are all at the lower end of the scale.  A similar point can be made about some counties that have had recent growth.  Although Dublin definitely benefits when funds are given to national bodies like the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, the benefits of that expenditure are felt more widely.

At the same time, we are talking about getting more people to use public transport.  That is a comment.<\/p>  <p>  My specific question relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which does great work.  I do not mean to be parochial when I mention a premises in Galway that has been empty for a long time.  The building in question is in a prime spot in Salthill.  The loss of revenue associated with the non-use of this premises is probably an expense.  I do not know.  Does Mr. Doyle know whether F&aacute;ilte Ireland or any of the other agencies under the remit of the Department have similar buildings that are empty?<\/p>  <p>  I also have a general question.  I got a bit carried away when I asked at length about the wonderful smarter travel document, which covers the period from 2009 to 2020.  One of the 41 actions that are to be carried out under the document involves the introduction of a sustainable plan.  When I asked yesterday about what has happened to the sustainable plan, I was told it was decided not to go ahead with it.  Was the smarter travel document reviewed?  How many of the actions were implemented?  When did the review take place?  What did we learn from it about where we are going?  Everyone here believes in public transport.  We know we have to do something about climate change.  Was this wonderful document implemented?  If not, why not?  Was it reviewed?  If not, why not?  What have we learned from it?  As I said earlier, the most recent estimate of the cost of a 16.5 km road that is planned in Galway was &euro;500 million, or over &euro;30 million per kilometre.  It seems that the estimated price of the road has now increased to &euro;600 million and nothing has yet been done.  How can such a price be justified?  I remind the committee that the road will affect two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of residential zoned land that was bought by the city council at a time when prices were at their prime.  One part of this parcel will be the subject of a future meeting of this committee.  The development of two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of land has been frozen because of a proposed ring road that is contrary to every one of the policies on my table, which themselves represent a small proportion of our policies on sustainable transport.  I ask Mr. Doyle to respond to my comment, my specific question and my general question about the need for sense to prevail in Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02100","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487852100,"counter":618,"content":"<p>We will come back to the Deputy with a specific response to her specific question about F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487852100,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Lovely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487852100,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy is referring to action 37-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487852100,"counter":621,"content":"<p>There are 39 actions in the document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487852100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>-----in the sustainable travel document, which commits to bring about a legislative underpinning to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1487852100,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Yes, that is it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487852100,"counter":624,"content":"<p>-----the sustainable transport document.<\/p> <p>That particular document was prepared in 2009 against an expectation of funding over the lifetime of it of the order of over &euro;4 billion, perhaps as much as &euro;4.5 billion, which obviously did not happen in the context of the fiscal crisis.  The key point in response to the Deputy's question is we do not have a view that sustainable transport is something that should exist separately from what we do in transport.  It has to be mainstreamed into what we do in transport.  That has to guide principles.  For example, as Luas cross-city works are being done, significant consideration has to be given on that project to how cyclists can co-exist with the trams.  We should not be considering smart ticketing or any of the other issues that are critically important in terms of getting people out of their cars on to public transport separately.  It is something we should be absolutely mainstreaming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017022300023#X02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487852700,"counter":626,"content":"<p>There are 49 actions laid out in this plan from 2009 to 2020.
