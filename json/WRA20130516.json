I am deeply concerned by the reports of grave human rights violations, including allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.<\/p><p>  On 21 March 2013, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted resolution 22\/14 on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.  The Irish Presidency of the European Union played a key role in the drafting and negotiation of the EU-led resolution, which expresses particular concern about the Rohingya minority in Rakhine\/Arakan State and persisting inter-communal tension.  The resolution urges the Government of Myanmar\/Burma to take action to protect the human rights of the Rohingya, and to repeal and\/or amend laws that deny the Rohingya the right to birth registration, the ability to marry and freedom of movement, including equal access to citizenship.  The resolution also calls upon the Government to ensure that those responsible for violence in Rakhine\/Arakan State are held to account and urges it to grant safe, timely, full and unhindered humanitarian access to all persons in need and to facilitate the voluntary return of individuals to their original communities.  The resolution also extends for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. <\/p><p>  On 29 April, the Government of Myanmar\/Burma released the report of an independent commission, tasked by the President of Myanmar, U Thein Sein, in mid-2012, with uncovering the root causes of sectarian violence in Rakhine\/Arakan State.  I welcome the various commitments made by the President since the release of the Commission&rsquo;s report, including a commitment to take all necessary actions to ensure the basic human rights of Muslims in Rakhine\/Arakan State, to uphold the rights to freedom of religion and freedom of speech and to address the humanitarian situation.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, on 22 April 2013, at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, the EU decided to lift all sanctions on Myanmar\/Burma, with the exception of the arms embargo and an embargo on equipment which might be used for internal oppression.  This decision was taken in the light of the broader political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar\/Burma since 2011 as part of the process of democratisation, and further to the Council&rsquo;s decision to suspend sanctions in April 2012. <\/p><p>  In conjunction with the decision to lift sanctions, there was also a discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on areas where further progress by Myanmar\/Burma is expected, including issues related to ethnic conflict.  Furthermore, the EU is providing development assistance amounting to &euro;75m to Myanmar\/Burma, including a &euro;19m humanitarian programme, which largely responds to needs arising from ethnic violence and extremism.<\/p><p>  Looking to the future, it is critical that the international community&rsquo;s engagement with, and support to, Myanmar\/Burma is carefully and comprehensively structured.  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Rakhine\/Arakan State, including at the Human Rights Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[23215\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent arrest of eight young Basque political activists in Donostia San Sebasti&aacute;n and the consequences these political arrests could have on the peace process there and if he will raise the issue with the Spanish Government.","asker":"1022","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>I have closely followed developments in relation to the Basque Country, including the outcome of the San Sebastian Conference in October 2011 and the subsequent declaration by ETA on 20 October 2011 that the organisation had &ldquo;decided on the definitive cessation of its armed activity&rdquo;.

It is expected that this issue will again be discussed at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in May, although the agenda for this meeting has not yet been finalised.  <\/p><p>  Recent discussions have focused in particular on prospects for reviving the peace process following the elections in Israel and re-engagement by the new US Administration.  The EU has always recognised that it would be very difficult to restart negotiations on the Middle East without the active engagement of the United States.  We are therefore anxious to give all the support we can to renewed involvement by the US.  The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is treating the peace process as a personal priority and has made several visits to the region.  President Obama&rsquo;s decision to visit Israel in March, at the start of his second term, was also very welcome. His clear outreach to Israeli public opinion will hopefully help to add momentum to the process.  I conveyed to Secretary Kerry the strong encouragement of the EU and discussed the prospects for making progress at a meeting which I had with him in Washington on 18 March, just before he left for Israel.<\/p><p>  While the resumption of talks is a key priority, the EU has also become increasingly concerned that the relentless expansion of the Israeli settlement programme is fast approaching a point where it will be physically impossible to construct a viable Palestinian state on the ground.  The EU has therefore pressed for changes in these policies and for action on a range of practical issues on the ground which are inhibiting the prospects for a viable peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[23227\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600047#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the suspected use of chemical weapons by Government and opposition forces in Syria; and if he has discussed this with his European counterparts.","asker":"1080","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>I am aware of the allegations that chemical weapons have been used in Syria.  Any use of chemical weapons would have appalling humanitarian consequences, is clearly contrary to international legal norms and must be utterly condemned.  British, French, US and Turkish intelligence sources have indicated that material they have recovered indicates the possible use of the nerve agent sarin.  At the moment, the available evidence is neither categorical, nor can it give a clear picture of who used the gas, as allegations have been made against both the Syrian authorities and opposition forces. What is clear is that an extremely worrying picture is emerging.   <\/p><p>  The European Union has repeatedly called on the Syrian authorities never to use its chemical weapons and to store them securely pending destruction under independent verification.  We have made the same calls in a national capacity.  At the recent Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took place only last month, the EU again expressed its grave concern at the allegations.  The 188 States Party to the Convention agreed that &lsquo;the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances would be reprehensible and completely contrary to the legal norms and standards of the international community&rsquo;. Regrettably, Syria is not a party to this Convention but it is bound by the 1925 Geneva Protocol which prohibits the use of chemical weapons.<\/p><p>  The EU has also written to the United Nations Secretary-General to insist that the investigation into allegations of use of chemical weapons in Syria which he is attempting to establish have unfettered access within Syria and that it must be comprehensive and investigate all serious allegations.  While discussions on the subject are ongoing in New York, it has not proven possible so far for the investigation team to commence its work as the Syrian authorities have refused to agree to the Terms of Reference requested by the Secretary-General.  The most recent information to emerge from Syria clearly makes it all the more urgent that this investigation be allowed to proceed without delay.

This substantial report, which my Department is studying with interest, will, I believe, be very helpful in supporting the case made by Ireland for some time that it is necessary to focus on the many practical difficulties which affect the lives of Palestinians and which are aimed - I regret to say deliberately - at pressurising them into abandoning their existing communities. The report details the very small proportion of state and municipal revenues spent proportionately in Palestinian communities in Jerusalem in welfare, education and health and the movement and other restrictions which greatly hinder daily life and economic activity for Palestinians.

In February the Council adopted comprehensive Conclusions which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation and counter the threat of terrorism in Mali, including the French-led Operation Serval and the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA). The Council also discussed the establishment and launch of an EU Training Mission in Mali, which is now working to support the strengthening and reform of the Malian army, including through important training in the area of human rights.  Ireland is contributing six trainers and two HQ personnel for the EU Training Mission.  The Council has emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.

All of these issues were discussed in detail yesterday, 15 May, at a major international Donor Conference on Mali, jointly hosted by the EU and France in Brussels.  Ireland was represented at the conference by the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello T.D., who reiterated the Government&rsquo;s support for the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach in Mali. He also noted our support for the series of UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Mali, including Resolution 2100, adopted on 25 April, which authorises the establishment of the new UN Peacekeeping Operation for Mali, MINUSMA.  It will take over from AFISMA on 1 July.  The UN Mission has been given a mandate to use all necessary means to carry out its tasks, which include the   stabilisation of key population centres and the re-establishment of State authority throughout the country; support for the implementation of the transitional roadmap, and the promotion and protection of human rights. MINUSMA will comprise 11,200 troops and 1,440 police. <\/p><p>  At the conference yesterday, Minister of State Costello announced that Ireland will provide a further &euro;2.5 million to respond to continuing humanitarian needs and to support the recovery of Mali.

The adoption of the Agreement was welcomed on behalf of the EU in a joint statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, which called on all sides to continue negotiating in good faith and to refrain from violence.   This important regional Agreement was reached by the Government of the DRC and ten neighbouring and regional countries.  The co-guarantors of the Agreement are the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the United Nations.  <\/p><p>  In the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s own words, a lasting solution in the DRC must have a number of essential elements.  It must be anchored in the political will of the leaders of all countries in the region.  It must address the structural causes fuelling instability in the DRC itself.  It must respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimate concerns and interests of all concerned countries.  It also demands the commitment and long-term support of the international community.  Lasting peace can only be secured in the DRC if the Agreement is implemented in full and the opportunity it presents is now grasped by all parties involved.  <\/p><p>  I have welcomed the appointment of Mary Robinson by the UN Secretary General as his Special Envoy for the region, to support the implementation of the Agreement.  I have assured her of the full support of Government, and of the European Union.  The Secretary General is also proposing the establishment of an Intervention Brigade to address security aspects of the crisis more comprehensively.  <\/p><p>  Ireland is also responding to the appalling humanitarian consequences of the crisis in the DRC.  Since 2009, the Government has provided &euro;42.8 million for the victims of this humanitarian crisis.  Last year, we provided over &euro;10 Million in emergency and longer-term development funding to the DRC.  In April, I announced a further &euro;3.8 million in funding for UN agencies and NGOs working in the DRC.  Of this &euro;3.8 million, some &euro;2 million has been channelled through the Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC.  This is a multi-donor pooled funding mechanism under the direction of the Humanitarian Coordinator for the DRC. It provides quick and flexible funding to UN humanitarian agencies and international and national NGOs on the basis of the needs on the ground.  The UN&rsquo;s Humanitarian Action Plan for the DRC for 2013 provides overall strategic guidance for the Common Humanitarian Fund in order to enable aid organisations to reach nearly 4 million people with urgently-needed food, water, shelter, healthcare and education.<\/p><p>  The remaining &euro;1.8 million is being provided to Irish Aid NGO partners working in the DRC.  &euro;450,000 is being provided to Christian Aid, &euro;450.000 to Concern, &euro;300,000 to Tr&oacute;caire and &euro;580,000 to Oxfam (&euro;580,000).

Under-nutrition is an often silent element of hunger which has devastating consequences.  Over four in ten children under the age of five in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are undernourished.  Under-nutrition not only puts these children at greater risk of infection and death, but it also stops them reaching their full potential in school and ultimately achieving economic success and productivity.  In the context of its G8 Presidency, the British Government, in partnership with the Government of Brazil and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), will host a 'Day of International Action' entitled 'Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science' on 8 June 2013 in London. <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland is a core partner on this initiative and I am pleased that the Taoiseach will attend this event at the invitation of British Prime Minister David Cameron.  It will build on the Olympic Hunger Summit held at Downing Street in August 2012 in which the Taoiseach participated. Ireland will continue its strong international advocacy and action on the importance of investment to address under-nutrition and to harness support for low income countries to address this challenge. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also welcome the opportunity to have dialogue on tax transparency in the forthcoming agenda of the G8 Summit.  Efficient and fair tax systems in developing countries are essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic services.  They are also vital for the promotion of good governance and for ensuring social cohesion.  Tax avoidance and evasion, therefore, present a major issue for developing countries seeking to drive their own development. <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland is playing a strong role at national level and in global efforts to increase revenue generation and tackle tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries.  The brokering by Ireland of an agreement in the EU for the revision of the EU transparency and accounting directives, which when passed into legislation will improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries, is one recent example of this.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland's new Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future<\/i> , firmly commits to supporting developing countries to raise their own domestic revenue in ways that are more efficient, fairer and better promote good governance and equitable development.  In the Policy, the Government commits to advancing efforts to combat tax evasion, illicit financial flows and capital flight that are stripping developing countries of badly needed resources for the provision of basic services and the tackling of poverty. <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland recognises that given the integrated nature of today's global financial and economic systems, many of the challenges in this area can only be overcome through international cooperation.  Bringing together as it does some of the world's major economic powers, the Tax, Trade and Transparency Summit on June 15 is therefore a very welcome initiative. Ireland, through the European Union's participation in this Summit, will push for ambitious steps to be taken on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[23225\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide further details of his recent four day trade mission to Turkey; his visit to Syrian refugee camps in Turkey; and if he discussed with the Turkish Government their dialogue with the PKK and attempts at creating a peace process.","asker":"998","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[23238\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if, in view of the his recent visit to Turkey, he believes that the PKK&rsquo;s historic ceasefire will have a positive impact on the political and security environment of that country, and create conditions for meaningful dialogue between the two sides.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[23104\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of his recent trade mission to Turkey; his views in relation to Turkey's application for membership of the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 58, and 65 together.<\/p><p>  First, I wish to take this opportunity to express my horror at the explosion of two bombs in Reyhanli, a town in Turkey close to the Syrian border, on Saturday 11 May, in which at least 46 people have died.  On behalf of the Irish Government I have sent a message to the Turkish government via our embassy in Ankara expressing our condolences to the families of the innocent civilians killed and our sympathies to the injured.  We express our solidarity with the people and government of Turkey, who have generously extended protection to hundreds of thousands of refugees from the crisis in Syria. <\/p><p>  I visited Turkey from 7 to 10 April 2013.  This visit had a number of aspects, including a bilateral trade mission, political discussions on our bilateral relations with Turkey and Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process, given Ireland&rsquo;s role as current Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.  I led the trade mission of 24 Enterprise Ireland companies, held discussions with Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ahmet Davoto\u011flu and Minister for EU Affairs, Mr. Egemen Bagi\u015f. I also met President G&uuml;l, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Science and Technology and the Minister for Energy.  In addition, I visited Syrian refugee camps hosted by the Turkish Government in Gaziantep in south eastern Turkey. <\/p><p>  Dealing first with the trade mission, contracts of over &euro;30 million for Enterprise Ireland client companies were announced.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s market strategy in Turkey is focused in particular on energy and environmental services, pharmaceuticals, ICT, financial services, education and engineering sectors.  Companies from all these sectors were represented on the mission.  I also undertook a range of meetings with prominent business people and business organisations in Ankara and Istanbul, including TIM (the Turkish Exporters Assembly) which signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Irish Exporters Association.  Trade between Turkey and Ireland has grown by 20% over the past three years and exports by EI client companies to Turkey grew by 9% in 2012.  In all it was a very productive visit and laid the groundwork for even greater trade engagement between Ireland and Turkey in the future.<\/p><p>  I discussed Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process with Ministers Davoto\u011flu and Ba\u011fi\u015f and with President G&uuml;l.  Ireland has long been supportive of Turkish EU membership and one of our priorities is to reinvigorate the accession process during our Presidency.  Work is progressing in this area and we hope to be in a position to open a negotiating Chapter (Chapter 22 &ndash; Regional policy and co-ordination of structural instruments) in June.  Appreciation was expressed by my interlocutors for the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s efforts in this regard but so too was some frustration at the slow pace of Turkey&rsquo;s accession progress.  I urged that implementation by Turkey of the Ankara Protocol would create new momentum for the accession process and provide the opportunity to unblock a number of areas currently stalled. <\/p><p>  Foreign Minister Davoto\u011flu also briefed me on the Kurdish issue and talks with the PKK.  The government is optimistic, but cautious.  The announcement on 21 March that PKK leader Abdullah &Ouml;calan has called a ceasefire is most welcome and represents an opportunity to build on the ongoing talks towards a durable and democratic settlement.  These are very welcome developments and I took the opportunity to wish the Government well in its efforts. <\/p><p>  On 8 April I visited refugee camps for Syrians at Nizet near Gaziantep.  Turkey was the first neighbour of Syria to formally respond to the influx of Syrian refugees.  It maintains an open border policy for those fleeing the conflict and it has been praised for the level of humanitarian assistance it has provided.  I commended my interlocutors for the efforts of the Turkish people and on the occasion of my visit announced a further Irish contribution of &euro;1 million in humanitarian assistance for Syrians, specifically targeted for Turkey.  This comprises &euro;500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and &euro;500,000 to the UNHCR and it brings Irish assistance for the humanitarian crisis in Syria to &euro;8,150,000 to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[23101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to review the passport application process for dual citizenship holders in order that his Department will keep statistics on the number of applications for passports by citizens who also hold a non-Irish passport and the number of non-Irish passports held by Irish citizens; if this issue has been raised at EU level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>The Passport Service does not require that an applicant for an Irish passport, as part of the regular application process, provide details of any foreign passports held.

The dimensions of the crisis are truly daunting.  An estimated 80,000 people have lost their lives; one-third of Syrians have either fled the country, are internally displaced or are otherwise in need of assistance; and there is an ever increasing threat to regional stability, as exemplified by the bomb explosion in Reyanhli in south Turkey on 12 May, which killed 46 people and injured hundreds.   <\/p><p>  Despite the level of destruction and violence, Ireland and its EU partners remain fully convinced that a political solution alone can bring about an end to the hostilities and lead the way towards a peaceful transition to democracy.<\/p><p>  Since his appointment in August 2012 and in extremely challenging circumstances, the UN\/League of Arab States Special Envoy, Ladkhar Brahimi, has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  Ireland and its EU partners have expressed full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria. <\/p><p>  The role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particularly through the UN Security Council, is crucial.  I therefore warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia, following bilateral discussions in Moscow last week involving Secretary of State Kerry, President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, to work together on an International Conference on Syria which would be held before the end of the month.  UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have also welcomed this development.  I urge the Syrian opposition to seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and to engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting a transition towards a genuine democratic dispensation in Syria. <\/p><p>  It also remains necessary to ensure that the many crimes and human rights abuses committed throughout the conflict do not go unpunished.  Ireland has been very much to the fore, both at the EU and international levels, in calling for all perpetrators to be held accountable for the war crimes and serious human rights violations they have committed, including through referral to the International Criminal Court.  Ireland has now agreed, along with 18 other EU member states, to co-sponsor a UN General Assembly resolution on Syria, due for adoption on 15 May, which addresses the current appalling situation in Syria and urges the need to ensure accountability.<\/p><p>  Ireland and the EU will remain fully occupied at all levels of our international engagement in securing the earliest cessation of violence in Syria and in providing the Syrian population with the aid and care they need and the hope that their nightmare will soon end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[23187\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600048#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of his discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with Members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the implementation of outstanding provisions in the Good Friday Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The Government remains committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and associated agreements and this is a regular subject for discussion in my meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the First and Deputy First Minister.

The centrepiece of my programme in Atlanta was an &lsquo;Invest in Ireland&rsquo; Business Leaders Forum organised by the IDA in conjunction with our Consulate General.  This event targeted both existing IDA clients and potential new investors.  I also held separate meetings with a number of major US and Irish companies operating in the Atlanta area.  The programme for New Orleans included further business networking, political and cultural events.

This has included the provision by Ireland and other donors of predictable emergency response funding.  However, disasters on the scale of the earthquake in Haiti, the famine in the Horn of Africa and, more recently, the conflict in Syria continue to challenge the humanitarian system.  For such crises, international pledging conferences are often considered necessary in order to generate additional donor funding.<\/p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed. For our part, we have worked hard to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the people of Haiti. Ireland pledged &euro;13 million at the Haiti Donor Conference in March 2010 and, by the end of 2012, had honoured this commitment, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million.<\/p><p>  Similarly, at a Ministerial mini-summit in New York in September 2011, An T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012. I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012. To date in 2013, I have approved almost &euro;6 million for continued humanitarian assistance to this region.<\/p><p>  Most recently, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and its neighbouring countries. Since I made that pledge, Ireland has already surpassed our commitment, with funding of &euro;5.7 million having been provided to date this year.  Ireland, as one of the founding members of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, takes seriously our commitment to act as a responsible and accountable donor. Equally, we are committed to the full implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which clearly articulates the EU and its Member States&rsquo; commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid pledges are transformed into commitments and disbursements in a timely way, and are clearly linked to the assessment of needs.  As Presidency of the European Union during the first half of 2013, we will continue to press our fellow EU Member States to live up to their commitments under the Consensus.<\/p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &lsquo;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&rsquo;. This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries. The Recommendation is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment of Prisoners","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[23239\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&rsquo;s (CPT) report into prison conditions between 31 May to 13 June 2011 in Spain, which was released on 30 April 2013; which found that some Basque political prisoners were subject to mistreatment and torture in Spanish prisons; and if he will raise the issue with the Spanish Government.","asker":"984","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>The Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) conducts periodic visits to places of detention in each Member State.

The report highlights how the continent should take advantage of this opportunity through a commodity-based industrialization strategy, leveraging Africa&rsquo;s abundant resources, high commodity prices, large youth populations and the changing global production process. <\/p><p>   These opportunities, and how Ireland can support them, are very much to the fore in the Government&rsquo;s recently launched Policy for International Development: One World, One Future. The Policy recognises the emergence of renewed confidence in developing countries, as they generate more of their own revenues, and open up further to the world. This is particularly true in Africa, which is and will remain the focus of the Government&rsquo;s official aid programme. Our aim, and the aim of our Key Partner Countries, is to reduce the dependency on aid and to empower governments and communities to address poverty and drive their own development. <\/p><p>  One of the three major goals in the Policy for International Development, therefore, is Sustainable Development and Inclusive Economic Growth. With this, we intend to increase our focus on trade and development and, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Africa Strategy, to better link development cooperation with the political and trade dimensions of our engagement in Africa. In doing so, we seek to contribute to increased trade and investment, private sector development, increased employment and enhanced human well-being.<\/p><p>  The Government very much welcomes the UN and African Union report. The implementation of industrial and other development policies to promote value addition and economic transformation and to reduce dependence on producing and exporting unprocessed commodities; the implementation of appropriate development planning frameworks and effective industrial policies; the removal of bottlenecks, the boosting of skills and capacity; and the promotion of regional and global integration, are all important recommendations from the report. If implemented, these recommendations will go a long way towards ensuring that Africa will no longer be a bystander to its own destiny addressing youth unemployment, poverty and gender disparities, and the other challenges faced by that continent.<\/p><p>  In our aid programme&rsquo;s engagement on economic growth, we too have a particular focus on those who are being left behind ensuring that development efforts target those most excluded, deliberately addressing the inequalities people face. Because if economic growth and industrialisation is to be sustained, it needs to be inclusive and it needs to tackle the root causes of poverty and vulnerability, thereby enabling developing countries to fully exploit their true potential and ensure development for all.  <\/p><p>  We are also very conscious of the fact that efficient and fair tax systems in developing countries are essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic services. Tax avoidance and evasion present a major issue for developing countries seeking to drive their own development. Ireland is playing a strong role in global efforts to increase revenue generation and tackle tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries. The brokering by Ireland of an agreement in the EU for the revision of the EU transparency and accounting directives, which when passed into legislation will improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries, is one recent example of this.<\/p><p>  Over the coming years, as we implement Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, we look forward to partnering with African Government&rsquo;s to deliver on the economic and trade opportunities identified in the very timely report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Development","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[23347\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he has engaged with his EU colleagues with a view to redefining a modern vision for Europe with particular reference to the need for solidarity, unity of purpose and mutual respect; if the experience of Europe over the past four years has identified particular or specific weaknesses needing attention the attendance to which in turn could have a major impact of confidence building and stability, politically, socially, fiscally and economically; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>Europe has faced an unprecedented economic challenge in recent years, with serious economic and social consequences.

I fully understand the disappointment expressed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan M&eacute;ndez, in relation to the decision taken by the Government of Bahrain to postpone his visit to the country, which was scheduled to take place from 8 to 15 May 2013.  According to the Special Rapporteur, this is the second time that his visit has been postponed at very short notice.<\/p><p>  The Bahrain Government has stated that the proposed visit could be damaging to the ongoing National Dialogue process taking place between the Government and opposition parties.  However, I believe that his visit would in fact have been timely given the ongoing concerns which have been expressed in relation to the possible ill-treatment of prisoners in Bahrain.  An independent assessment of the situation would have contributed positively to the National Dialogue process and strengthened trust among the parties that the Government is truly committed to taking steps to promote a culture of transparency and respect for human rights in Bahrain.<\/p><p>  In this case and in all others, Ireland strongly supports the office of the Special Rapporteur on torture and maintains that the independent mandate of his office must be fully respected by all countries.  We believe that the Government of Bahrain should honour the commitments made to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review process in September 2012, among which was the acceptance of a recommendation to welcome a visit by the Special Rapporteur.<\/p><p>  The US State Department&rsquo;s 2012 country report on Bahrain, released in April of this year, is a useful and detailed contribution to the international community&rsquo;s assessment of the human rights environment within that country.  The report outlines a number of very serious concerns reported in 2012, including allegations of torture in both official government detention centres and unofficial sites.  It also details the lack of due process in trials of political and human rights activists, with some resulting in harsh sentences.<\/p><p>  Arbitrary arrest is also one of the issues outlined in the State Department report and in this context the arrest of human rights defender, Mr. Naji Fateel, at his home in north-west Bahrain on 2 May, is of serious concern.  Mr. Fateel is a board member of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, and a blogger who has been active in reporting human rights violations in Bahrain.  Mr. Fateel attended the Front Line Defenders 2010 Dublin Platform.  According to the latest reports received, on 5 May he was transferred to the Dry Dock prison in Bahrain.  It is alleged that he is suffering from several injuries received due to torture while he was in detention.  On 9 May, he was charged with the establishment of a group for the purpose of disabling the constitution under article 6 of the Terrorism Act.  The prosecutor has ordered sixty days further imprisonment pending investigation.  I call on the Bahrain government to ensure Mr. Fateel&rsquo;s human rights are fully respected during his detention.<\/p><p>  I have repeatedly called on the Government of Bahrain to demonstrate its commitment to upholding human rights and to implement in full the recommendations of the Bahraini International Commission of Inquiry.  I have ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities and I will continue to do so.   Officials in my Department make clear our concerns to the Bahraini Ambassador in London as required; and Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Riyadh, who is accredited to Bahrain, has raised human rights issues directly with the authorities there on every appropriate occasion, including most recently with the Foreign Minister while the Ambassador was in Bahrain over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.<\/p><p>  At EU level, High Representative Ashton and senior EU officials have regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities the EU&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.  I fully support the High Representative&rsquo;s readiness to provide, if requested, EU support for the resumed national dialogue process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[23222\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600049#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide further details on the three year Strategic Partnership Agreement that the Government recently signed with the UN World Food Programme.","asker":"1047","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>On 15 April 2013, I joined my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Simon Coveney, T.D., in signing a three-year Strategic Partnership Agreement with the World Food Programme (WFP) on the occasion of the WFP Executive Director&rsquo;s visit to Dublin to participate in the Hunger-Nutrition-Climate Justice Conference.<\/p><p>  The WFP is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and, on average, provides food assistance to more than 90 million people in 70 countries every year.

Ireland&rsquo;s total support to WFP in 2012 amounted to approximately &euro;14 million. Of this, just under &euro;10 million was provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with the remainder being provided for specific humanitarian emergencies by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme. In 2012, Irish Aid funding was provided for WFP&rsquo;s emergency activities in Chad, Syria and the Sahel, as well as for the operation of the UN Humanitarian Air Service, which is managed by the WFP.<\/p><p>  The Strategic Partnership Agreement with the WFP is a non-legally binding statement of mutual commitment to shared principles and strategic objectives in addressing the issue of global food insecurity. Through the Agreement, the Government has committed itself to supporting WFP in order to reduce hunger and under-nutrition, save lives and livelihoods in humanitarian emergencies, and strengthen the capacity of countries to invest in disaster preparedness and prevention.<\/p><p>  Under the Agreement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has committed to the provision of an annual contribution of &euro;7 million to the WFP over a three-year period. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme, also provides the WFP with additional contributions on the basis of humanitarian need. Under this Agreement, we will continue to consider additional contributions on a case-by-case basis, in view of humanitarian needs identified and funding available.<\/p><p>  In this context, to date this year, I have already approved &euro;2.25 million in humanitarian funding for the WFP this year.

There are in excess of 6.8 million Syrians requiring immediate assistance inside the country, over 4million of whom have been internally displaced. Widespread and indiscriminate violence has resulted in an estimated 80,000 deaths and has forced whole communities to flee for sanctuary in neighbouring countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Many thousands more are gathering in border areas inside Syria planning risky crossings as the civil war continues to claim more lives.    The latest figures from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, indicate that almost 1.5 million refugees have now been forced to leave Syria, almost half of whom are children. As the influx continues, Governments and host populations across the region are facing serious strains on their health and education systems, housing and other services. Over three quarters of all refugees are living amongst host communities and the continuing ability of these communities to support new arrivals is limited. My own visit to al-Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan in 2012 and the T&aacute;naiste's visit to Nizip refugee camp in southern Turkey in April this year highlighted the extent of the humanitarian challenge and the dangers posed to international peace and security by this continuing crisis. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy notes, the unfolding conflict has the potential to have a significant impact on the situation in Lebanon, as a neighbouring country with close links to Syria and a history of political instability and conflict. The EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 22 April, which the T&aacute;naiste attended, looked at how the EU could enhance its support to Lebanon in order to avoid its fragile stability being further undermined. Together with our European partners, we will continue to support Prime Minister Salam and his Government as they respond to the refugee influx and work<b><\/b>  to prevent sectarian violence and civil conflict being triggered in Lebanon as a result of the Syrian situation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has responded generously to the crisis in Syria and its neighbouring countries, and to date has provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance through partners such as WFP, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). A significant proportion of this support has also been allocated to the UNHCR which is leading the international response to the refugee crisis through the Regional Refugee Response Plan. However, this UN supported plan has only received approximately 55% of the US$1 billion requested to meet the needs of the burgeoning refugee population. It is somewhat disappointing that commitments made by the international community to assist these vulnerable groups remain unfulfilled and we are doing all we can to ensure that other States follow our example in meeting such promises in full and without delay. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government will remain in close contact with its Embassies in the region, UN agencies and NGO partners on the ground to closely monitor the ongoing situation in Syria and its neighbouring countries. We stand ready to consider further support in light of our own resources and in consultation with our partners on the ground. We will remain fully supportive of all efforts to promote the earliest possible political settlement, and of efforts to ensure full accountability for the many war crimes and human rights violations committed since the conflict erupted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600051#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":148,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 27.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":149,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":150,"content":"<p>Question No. 60 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":151,"content":"<p>Question No. 61 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":152,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600051#WRE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[23348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600051#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the action he has taken to date to encourage the United States administration to close Guantanamo Bay; his views on the ongoing hunger strike in the prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>Ireland has repeatedly called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention centre, urging that those detained there be either brought to trial or released as soon as possible.

My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, takes the lead on Government policy in relation to biofuels and EU policy on biofuels, including the European Commission's proposal to limit the use of crop-based biofuels in transport to 5% by 2020.<\/p><p><br \/>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive of 2009 requires that, by 2020, 10% of transport fuels should come from renewable sources.

The Commission included a proposal that the 10% quota be reduced to 5%.

The issue is currently being progressed at an ad hoc working group of the EU Energy and Environment Councils, with the objective of producing a progress report for the meetings of the Energy and Environment Councils in June 2013.   The fight to end extreme hunger is, and will remain, a key priority for Ireland's international development programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Since his appointment in August 2012, the UN\/League of Arab States Special Envoy Ladkhar Brahimi has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  The international community has consistently expressed its full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria.<\/p><p>  The role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particular through the UN Security Council, remains essential.  I therefore warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia on 7 May to host an International Conference on Syria which would be held before the end of the month.  UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have also welcomed this development.  I urge both sides to the conflict to seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and to engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting a transition towards a genuine democratic dispensation in Syria.<\/p><p>  It remains essential not to lose sight of the dreadful humanitarian crisis that is unfolding as a result of the conflict in Syria; we are now faced with a truly alarming situation, with almost 1.5 million refugees and over 6.8 million within Syria in need of assistance.  I was able myself to witness the impact of this appalling conflict on ordinary civilians and children when I visited a refugee camp at Nizip on the Turkish-Syrian border in early April.  The crisis is placing particular pressure on neighbouring countries which are required to host large numbers of refugees.  It is important that the international community continues to provide financial and political support to these countries in order to prevent a further deterioration of the humanitarian and security situation.<\/p><p>  In response to the various calls for support and help, Ireland has generously contributed more than &euro;8 million to this humanitarian crisis, including a &euro;1 million contribution to the UN-led humanitarian effort which I announced during my recent visit to Turkey.  Total EU assistance to date currently stands at well in excess of &euro;600 million.

After decades of war, instability and poor governance the humanitarian needs facing the country are enormous.  Ongoing conflict, human rights violations and gender-based violence in the east of the country continue to displace hundreds of thousands of people internally and across borders into Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.  The challenges facing the DRC require the support of the international community not just in terms of traditional humanitarian interventions but also longer term strategies which aim to build the lasting capacity and increase the ability of communities to withstand future shocks.  Furthermore, the situation demands the attention and political support of the United Nations and regional actors.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I have in recent weeks voiced Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the appointment by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of Mary Robinson as his Special Envoy to oversee the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement and the leadership offered by the United Nation in this renewed effort to break the cycle of violence in eastern DRC.  I also recognise the constructive role the European Union is playing in the region.  The EU is working through political and diplomatic engagement and development cooperation programmes, in support of implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement and the strengthening of the UN peace-keeping force MONUSCO.  The European Commission (DG ECHO) provided almost &euro;61 million in humanitarian aid to DRC in 2012, with a further &euro;12.7 million provided to the Great Lakes region and in support of Congolese refugees.  Current plans foresee at least &euro;54 million being provided in 2013.  As Presidency of the European Union, Ireland has consistently worked to ensure a strong EU position on the DRC and to highlight the need for humanitarian organisations in eastern DRC to have access to those displaced and in need of assistance.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC.  In 2012 alone, Ireland provided over &euro;10 million in emergency and longer-term development funding to the country.  Some &euro;6.9 million of this funding was allocated to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for DRC, a UN-administered fund which is allocated to projects by the resident UN Humanitarian Coordinator, with an additional &euro;3 million provided to Christian Aid, Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam.  So far in 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;3.8 million in funding, with much of this directed at the provision of emergency food, water, health and protection to vulnerable groups in eastern DRC.<\/p><p>  In addition to this direct humanitarian assistance and our work as EU Presidency, Ireland also continues to monitor the human rights situation in the DRC closely and will continue to use our membership of the Human Rights Council to raise issues of concern with regards human rights abuses and violations as appropriate.  In this regard, we look forward to raising these issues when the Human Rights Council next discusses DRC in September 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union Membership","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[23609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he and his colleagues within the EU have managed to focus on a situation that may arise in the event of Britain leaving the European Union; if it is recognised that the future decision by the UK might yet become a self-fulfilling prophecy with permanent damage to EU solidarity; if other likeminded Member States have been identified in this context; the extent to which the EU intends to address any such situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>It is clear that the on-going debate in the UK about its membership of the European Union is a live one, and that it is set to continue for some time.

We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.

We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.<\/p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments.  Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance.  Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it.  We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.

Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.  Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.

It is hoped this development may lead to Council decisions in June on the opening of accession negotiations with Serbia and the opening of negotiations of Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Kosovo.  However, progress on the implementation of the Belgrade Pristina Dialogue Agreement will be important between now and June.  The Commission also published its report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in April.

A further important international Conference on Somalia, with particular focus on ways of supporting its economic and social development in the context of the Busan New Deal on Fragile States, will be hosted by the European Union in Brussels later this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Solidiers","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[23615\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community continues to focus on the use of child soldiers in various conflicts in Africa and elsewhere; if any particular initiative has been taken to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[23621\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community is in a position to discourage the recruitment of child soldiers in the various conflict zones worldwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[23623\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community has identified countries in which child soldiers are used in conflict; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[23624\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which Ireland&rsquo;s influence at Human Rights Council level has engaged in the discouragement of the use of child soldiers and human rights abuses in the various conflict zones worldwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 89, 90 and 91 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The recruitment and use of child soldiers continues to be a serious problem and a matter of grave concern to Ireland and indeed the international community.  The involvement of child soldiers has been reported in most recent armed conflicts and in almost every region of the world over the last two decades.  Each year, the United Nations Secretary-General issues a report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups - both state and non-state - that recruit and use children.  The most recent list includes 52 state and non-state armed groups operating across three continents.  It is estimated that up to 300,000 children continue to be involved in more than 30 conflicts worldwide, including, notably, in a number of internal and regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p><p><br \/>  Against this background, international legal efforts to curb the practice of using children in armed conflict have been stepped up significantly.  In 1996, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the post of Special-Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict<b>,<\/b> tasked to serve as an independent advocate for the protection and well-being of boys and girls affected by armed conflict.  In 1999, the UN<b><\/b>Security Council passed its first Resolution highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context.  With the adoption of nine Resolutions and several Presidential statements since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000 and entered into force in 2002.  It is considered the core international human rights treaty on child soldiers: It lays out clear standards relating to the recruitment and use of under-18s by state armed forces as well as non-state armed groups which, if fully implemented, provide a strong foundation for long-term prevention of unlawful recruitment and use of children, and for assisting those who have already became involved in armed conflict.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has engaged on this issue in various ways including, crucially, through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development - major root causes of this problem.  Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific interventions from supporting agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, to designing interventions in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict.<\/p><p><br \/>  We remain deeply committed to addressing this issue, as has been recently reflected in Ireland's new Policy for International Development, 'One World, One Future', where we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict.  We are actively examining options for strengthened action in this area.  We are also actively exploring ways in which we can use our membership at the UN Human Rights Council to support ongoing international efforts on this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":215,"content":"<p>Question No. 84 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[23617\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600053#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which he and his EU\/UN colleagues endeavour to ensure that aid intended for specific objectives actually goes to those for whom it was intended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>As Minister of State with responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that our development assistance is used to achieve its intended objectives.

All programmes considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised using clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, cost effectiveness and sustainability of intended impact.  All partners in receipt of aid funds are obligated to report regularly on the results being achieved as a consequence of this support.  At the most fundamental level our aid must make a real difference in the lives of the poor and must assist in building essential service delivery systems and capacity for the future.<\/p><p>  We work closely with the UN and EU in conducting joint appraisals, ensuring clear and measurable targets for our aid are agreed and that the achievement of these is monitored in a systematic and transparent manner.  Programmes in receipt of funding through the Irish Aid programme are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved.

During its first four and a half months in office, steady progress has been made on the Presidency&rsquo;s policy objectives.  In the remaining seven weeks of the Presidency the Government will further intensify its efforts to drive its Presidency programme forward and to deliver strong and tangible results for the EU and its citizens.  We were pleased to have secured agreement in February on the Youth Guarantee programme.  The decision reached at the February European Council on a &euro;6bn fund to tackle youth unemployment in the worst-affected regions in the EU was also significant.  The Presidency will continue to  make progress on initiatives such as the Erasmus for All programme aimed at ensuring that all citizens, but particularly young people, have access to the skills and education to equip them for today&rsquo;s job market.  As Presidency, Ireland also identified the research and innovation sector as an area with strong growth potential and we are working hard on initiatives such as the Horizon 2020 funding programme and the European Research Area to support future growth and employment in this fast-growing sector.

The Irish Presidency also placed a strong emphasis on measures aimed at strengthening and modernising the Single Market to deliver growth and job creation.  The agreement secured on the Accounting Directive and the Union Customs Code will contribute to reducing the administrative burden on businesses, in particular SMEs.  The Re-Use of Public Sector Information agreement that the Presidency brokered in April also offers strong potential to spur growth and support the creation of new jobs in Europe.  The Unified Patent Court (UPC) agreement will not just help business by providing a one-stop shop for registering and protecting patents within the EU, but will also contribute to driving growth in the digital Single Market.  Our ongoing work in driving forward policy on key issues including e-identification regulation and the data protection package is proceeding well.  The Presidency will host the Digital Agenda Assembly in Dublin in June which we hope will contribute to the development of this critical sector of the Irish and European economies.<\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also working to advance the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda with third countries in order to open new markets for Europe&rsquo;s exporters and to create jobs.  Good progress is being made in trade negotiations with a number of countries in Asia.  One of our top priorities in the trade area remains securing a mandate for the start of negotiations on a Trade and Investment Partnership with the US given the very great potential for growth and job creation that such an agreement could generate on both sides of the Atlantic.  This will remain a key focus for the remainder of the Presidency.  <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also attaching major importance to measures which promote stability and confidence in Europe&rsquo;s economy.  In parallel with its focus on growth and jobs, we have placed a strong emphasis on restoring health to the EU&rsquo;s banking system to support future growth, protect tax-payers and avoid past mistakes.  Good progress has been made on advancing the Banking Union package of legislation, with agreements secured by the Presidency on the Capital Requirements Directive IV and Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We are now working on other elements of the Banking Union, in particular the Banking Resolution and Recovery proposal.  The Presidency has also secured agreement in other areas including on proposals such as the Mortgage Credit Directive and the &ldquo;Two Pack&rdquo; legislation which improves budgetary surveillance and coordination in the euro area.<\/p><p>  Following the decision taken at the European Council last February on the EU&rsquo;s future financing, the Taoiseach and I have met on a number of occasions with the President of the European Parliament (EP) to address the issues preventing the Parliament from giving its approval to the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014 to 2020.  Ireland considers that timely agreement on the budget is critical given the implications for EU initiatives which support the creation of employment, economic growth and social cohesion in Europe.  The Taoiseach and I met EP President Schulz and Commission President Barroso in Brussels on 6 May, and I am pleased that our discussions formed the basis of further negotiations on resolving outstanding differences which I attended earlier this week.  The Presidency remains open and fully committed to working with all partners to secure a deal on the budget to ensure that it is put to work at the earliest opportunity to support employment and growth in Europe.<\/p><p>  The Presidency has also brokered agreements on a wide range of other issues including protecting citizens from serious cross-border threats to health, strengthening provisions on water quality in the EU, improving the safety of workers in offshore oil and gas prospection and protecting workers in contact with electromagnetic fields.  And we look forward to delivering more agreements over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The Government has invested a great deal in this Presidency, because we believe that Ireland&rsquo;s future and its future interests in Europe are best served by being an active and constructive Member State.  Building on the progress made to date, every member of Government will work over the coming weeks to deliver results that contribute to a better Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600054#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":227,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 89 to 91, inclusive, answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600054#WRH00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Debtors","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600054#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[23404\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600054#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will ensure that a person (details supplied) is prevented from buying back their loans at a discount from National Assets Management Agency, in view of the fact that they have refused to deliver on their responsibilities to remediate homes in their developments which have pyrite and other building defects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that it is precluded from discussing matters relating to particular debtors by virtue of Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act.

In either case the terms of the repayment will obviously be determined by the instrument creating or evidencing the debt - repayable on demand or at a certain future time.

Prior to the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman complaints from consumers of insurance and credit institutions were handled by two voluntary ombudsman schemes.

A person whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) qualifies for deferral.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for part deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.  Interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  Full details of all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue's website, <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  The simplest and most straightforward way for some DSP payment recipients to pay their LPT liability is through deduction at source from certain payments that they receive from the Department.  The relevant payments are: State Pension (Contributory); State Pension (Non-Contributory); Widow\/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension; Widow\/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension; State Pension (Transition); One Parent Family Payment; Invalidity Pension; Carer's Allowance;  Disability Allowance; and Blind Pension.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are no fees or charges associated with deduction at source and the property owner simply indicates their payment preference on the online LPT Return form.  It should be noted that Section 92(2) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that the LPT deduction may not reduce the net scheme payment below the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate, which is currently &euro;186 per week.  <\/p><p><br \/>  For someone who is temporarily unemployed the deferral option may be the most appropriate approach pending a change in his or her circumstances.  It may suit them to pay the tax in cash through one of the three approved payment service providers who are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  A transaction fee will be charged by the service providers concerned.

At the outset I would like to clarify that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.   I would also refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to a similar Question No. 231 on 16th April.    The Deputy has requested that all possible scenarios that may arise under this relief will be catered for without adversely discriminating based on the nature of the disability or disabilities in question.  The relief under section 15A of the 2012 Act is provided to a person who has a disability within the meaning of section 2 of the Disability Act 2005.  Under section 2 of the 2005 Act, disability means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the LPT legislation provides for the widest possible application of the relief.<\/p><p>  Section 15A of the 2012 Act provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where adaptation work has increased the chargeable value of a property, the liable person determines the reduction in the chargeable value of the property and calculates the revised chargeable value and decides which valuation band is relevant to the property.  He or she should include the appropriate valuation band on his or her LPT Return, select a payment preference, and submit the return to Revenue.  No supporting documentation is required to be submitted with the Return.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600055#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Information Exchange System","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600055#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[23422\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600055#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies that make returns using the connect direct facility to submit VAT Information Exchange System returns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are currently 6 companies who submit VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) returns using the Connect Direct facility.

The incident did not impact on anybody who filed and paid via computer, nor did it affect any of the other available payment options for Local Property Tax (LPT).<\/p><p>  I know that Revenue is extremely concerned about the incident and has, and continues to be, in contact with the company concerned.  I fully support the strong response and prompt action taken by the Commissioners.  I am informed that the matter is now in the hands of the Gardai and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment further on that aspect of the matter.<\/p><p>  In regard to security, the company that operates the Helpline was able to very quickly identify the person responsible for the inappropriate access because it has very sophisticated call management and recording systems available to log all calls.  On concluding its investigation the company, which is both ISO and PCI accredited, assured Revenue that the incident was an isolated matter relating to a single individual.  It was not related to any technology or systems breach and was not related to the secure on-line payments system for LPT. <\/p><p>  When Revenue extended the facility to file and pay on-line, via the LPT Helpline, special arrangements were put in place with the company in line with best practice, including setting up a filing team which is located in a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and secure environment, with additional monitoring features, who do not have access to mobile phones or any other facility to record personal or payment details.  The person in question was not a member of this team, and had no authority to request any payment details from customers.<\/p><p>  Since the incident also constituted a data protection breach, Revenue reported it to the Data Protection Commissioner on Friday, and is continuing to liaise with that Office.<\/p><p>  Revenue has asked me to reassure the public that payment of tax by either credit or debit card is completely secure, and that in the unlikely event of any illegal access, the card owner will not suffer any loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600055#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Treaties","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK00100"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[23549\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if European Union treaty change is necessary, thus triggering a referendum here, in order to legally create a single EU bailout agency and rescue fund; if he or his officials discussed this treaty change matter with the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble or his German officials either on the 14 May ECOFIN meeting in Brussels or beforehand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>As Presidency, we are working to progress the ambitious agenda on Banking Union set by the European Council in December. <\/p><p>  We have achieved agreement on the Single Supervisory Mechanism &ndash; a very significant step forward.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the full insolvency process. It is focused on enhancing cooperation between lenders of secured and unsecured debt in order to resolve distressed debt at an early stage. <\/p><p>  The framework produced by the Central Bank establishes a series of principles to be applied in debt restructuring solutions for borrowers. In particular it outlines a &lsquo;Resolution Waterfall&rsquo; which sets out a series of debt affordability scenarios. Treatments will be applied to the borrower&rsquo;s debts in order to establish the most appropriate, affordable modification that sets the borrower on a sustainable footing for the remaining period of the loans. <\/p><p>  The framework will be implemented on a pilot basis by participating lenders using a representative sample of 750 borrowers who are experiencing significant financial difficulty repaying the mortgage on the family home and who have other unsecured debt. The pilot scheme will run for three months from the end of June and will conclude with a thorough review of all results to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in dealing with such cases and to determine next steps.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it has been agreed among the lender participants to use an independent third party service provider as the most appropriate way to engage with borrowers, whose consent to participate will be sought.  I am informed by the Central Bank that discussions are underway to determine the most appropriate provider and that no decision has yet been made. However I understand that an important consideration for the Central Bank, due to the short timelines involved, is the ability of the provider to provide an effective and efficient service at short notice. <\/p><p>  To be eligible for the Framework, a borrower must be co-operating with his lenders, as defined in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  It will apply to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty but who have taken reasonable steps to maximise income and curtail expenditure.   All existing protections afforded by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and the CCMA will continue to apply to participating borrowers.

In my previous replies I also indicated that the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment date determines the closing date for paper return filing of 7 May 2013.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May 2013 is the <i>de facto <\/i>extension to this date.  <\/p><p><br \/>  While the due date for filing paper LPT returns has now passed, a number of options are available to property owners for filing their returns electronically by the 28 May filing deadline.

It should also be noted that the credit card holder will not be held liable where the card is used without their proper authorisation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the range of options that have been made available by Revenue to assist people experiencing any difficulty in meeting their LPT obligations, and the fact that owners of residential properties have already filed in excess of 700,000 returns and utilised the different payment options, I am very satisfied with the current arrangements that Revenue has in place and the communication of these arrangements to the public. <\/p><p><br \/>  Therefore, I do not propose, nor is it practicable given the logistics involved, to extend the closing date or nor do I consider that any changes to Revenue's procedures are required in the run-up to the online LPT Return filing date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Training Programmes","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[23534\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600056#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether work training opportunities, for those who do not access third level education should be provided to sufferers from Narcolepsy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>F&Aacute;S Training Programmes are open to all unemployed individuals.

During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.<\/p><p>  In 2002, my Department agreed arrangements for the provision of funding for supervision in respect of mid-morning and lunch-time breaks which are set out in Circular 21\/02. Specific arrangements apply in the case of small schools, i.e. 1, 2 and 3 teacher schools. In such schools, each teacher may claim payment for up to 37 hours per school year for the provision of supervision services. Payment for further hours of supervision, up to a maximum of 122 hours per school year, is made by grant to the Board of Management of the school. Some or all of the 122 hours may be undertaken by an external supervisor appointed by the school. For example, if the teacher(s) in the school opt out of the supervision scheme, all 122 hours can be undertaken by an external supervisor.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, given the number of relatively small schools that have four teachers or fewer, multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of our primary schools. This is reflected in the centrally-devised Primary School Curriculum (1999) which articulates a progressive and developmental learning experience for our pupils. General guidance and advice for teachers are provided in National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) curriculum documents, and assessment guidelines etc. that are applicable to all primary schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600057#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further Education and Training Programmes Eligibility","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600057#WRL00675"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[23395\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600057#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address concerns that are set out in a submission (details supplied) which relates to the Further Education and Training Bill","asker":"997","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[23459\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600057#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is considering broadening the definition of the Further Education and Training Bill to include community education.","asker":"1034","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 126 together.<\/p><p>  I recognise that further education and training as it is currently delivered covers a broad spectrum that ranges from basic adult literacy and numeracy courses to courses that are certified at level 6 and above on the National Framework of Qualifications.

As part of this process it was agreed that the NCSE would include the advice on the Down's syndrome.  The NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs is currently in preparation and is expected shortly.

You may recall that Minister Hayes did not indicate that an impact assessment had been carried out but noted that the impact on local jobs had been carefully considered and that very substantial dialogue with representatives of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector had taken place before the introduction of the circular.<\/p><p>  The key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money.  It is also worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. When Circular 06\/12 was being drafted the decision was made to include the existing national contracts that applied across the majority of the public sector as commonly purchased goods and services. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has developed tender documentation to encourage the participation of SMEs. For example, the contract for office supplies was divided into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacities were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. <\/p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example, the indigenous company, which won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. <\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.

Expanding trade is also essential to job creation: About 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, an increase of 10 million jobs since 1995. On average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports between 8,000 and 15,000 additional jobs across the EU. Research in Ireland by Forfas suggests that over 4 jobs are sustained by indigenous companies for every &euro;1 million in exports.<\/p><p>  Trade Negotiations underway or planned could boost EU GDP by more than 2% or &euro;250bn -equivalent to the size of the Austrian or Danish economy &mdash; and support an increase of more than 2 million jobs related to trade across the EU. Ireland will continue to target the markets where there are FTAs or where FTAs are in prospect to avail of the opportunities they present. <\/p><p>  In its report, issued in February this year, the EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth concluded that a comprehensive agreement addressing a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributing to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit for both parties. An ambitious and comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) could benefit the EU economy by as much as &euro;119 billion per year and the US by up to &euro;95 billion. [For a family of four in the EU, that would translate on average to an extra &euro;545 in disposable income annually.] Consequently it recommended an ambitious approach to negotiating a trade and investment agreement between the two biggest parties in the transatlantic marketplace. <\/p><p>  The EU Council is considering a negotiating mandate that will set the parameters in which the EU Commission will seek to negotiate a TTIP. The Irish Presidency has prioritised securing agreement from EU member states on the final negotiating mandate.My Department is working intensively to achieve this at the Trade Council on June 14. The US is a traditional yet strong market for Ireland. In 2011 Ireland exported &euro;27 billion worth of Goods and Services to the US making the US our second largest export market, while total trade with the US was over &euro;58 billion.<\/p><p>  A comprehensive agreement with the US will remove virtually all tariffs and significantly reduce over time important regulatory and technical barriers to trade. These changes would reduce the cost of Irish exports to US consumers as well as reducing or eliminating the cost and administrative burden on firms having to meet two sets of regulatory and compliance requirements. An agreement with the US will also make it easier and cheaper to sell services to the US as well as new opportunities in gaining access to the huge US public procurement market.  As negotiations with the US have not yet started and as it will be some time before initial offers are exchanged it is not possible at this stage to establish precise detail about the economic impact on the economy.  <\/p><p>  EU-Japan<\/p><p>  The Japanese market for Irish goods and services presents many opportunities for Irish companies. In 2012 we exported over &euro;2 billion in goods to Japan, an increase of 20% on 2011. Trade with Japan is significant and that economy is our 11th  largest export market.<\/p><p>  Negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and Japan were launched on 25 March 2013. The aim is for a comprehensive agreement in goods, services and investment eliminating tariffs, non-tariff barriers and covering other trade-related issues, such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition and sustainable development. <\/p><p>  Analysis is underway on the economic benefits of a trade agreement with Japan. As negotiations have only commenced in the past few weeks, certainty about the impact on the Irish economy will become clearer when initial offers are exchanged possibly next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Expenditure","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01450"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[23520\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the level of expenditure spent on consultants and contractors at a national state agency (details supplied), in particular that more than &euro;200,000 has reportedly been spent on efficiency consultants and where retired senior managers have repeatedly been brought back as highly paid consultants.","asker":"1020","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>Procurement issues are a day-to-day matter for the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  <\/p><p>  However, I have been advised by the NSAI that its procurement policy complies with competitive tendering requirements, as outlined in the Public Procurement Guidelines Competitive Process (2004), State Bodies Guidelines and EU Regulations.

The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body<font color=\"#FF0000\">.<\/font>   While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. <\/p><p><br \/>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. <\/p><p><br \/>  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by Registered Employment Agreements are unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.<\/p><p><br \/>  There were 6 existing sectorial REAs registered or varied by the Labour Court in recent years: two in the Construction Sector and one each covering Electrical Contracting, Printing, Overhead Powerline Contractors and Dublin Drapery, Footwear and Allied Trades. It is estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 workers were covered by these sectorial agreements. In addition, there were over 50 employment agreements covering individual enterprises that had been registered by the Court under the 1946 Act.<\/p><p><br \/>  The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can now be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.<\/p><p><br \/>  From the parties' perspective, the primary objective of REAs is to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that will apply when the employer is tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions. The agreements also have the effect of ensuring that the industry terms and conditions are recognised and maintained. In addition, the existence of these legally backed agreements is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is a significant judgment that requires careful consideration having regard also to the amendments to the 1946 Act contained in the 2012 Industrial Relations Act. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Attorney General has been asked to supply advice on any potential implications of the judgment for the 1946 Act as amended by the 2012 Industrial Relations Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01850"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[23391\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600059#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if all the necessary information has been submitted in order to finalise a decision on disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; when a decision will issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all the evidence, including that adduced at the oral hearing, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned.

In addition major process improvement projects have been completed with significant improvements in processing times and the elimination of backlogs in many scheme areas.<\/p><p>  As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last year, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.  This had put pressure on the administration of appeals and resulted in some delays which are regrettable.  This is being addressed and will be cleared in the next number of months.  In addition, delays did develop in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced number of medical assessors due to retirements.  The Department has addressed this issue by recently running a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  To date six Medical Assessors have been appointed from this panel, three of whom took up duty in November 2012 and a further three in March of this year.  It is expected that a further four medical assessors will be appointed from the panel in the near future. <\/p><p>  I place great emphasis on ensuring that all appeals are processed in a timely manner but the length of time from when an appeal against a refusal is accepted and registered with the appeals office to where the appeals office receives the file from the relevant scheme area varies.

Because of its quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific case highlighted I can confirm that the Department received a Carer's Allowance application from the person in question on the 23rd of February 2012.

He was notified of this decision, the reason for it, and of his right of review or appeal on the 8th of August 2012.  The applicant subsequently appealed this decision and sent in further medical evidence on the 31st of August 2012.  This medical evidence was scanned on 22nd of September 2012 and a review of the medical evidence was completed by a Medical Assessor on the 7th of January 2013.  The additional information did not alter the opinion of the medical assessor, the deciding officer saw no grounds to change the original decision and the file was submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office on the 18th of January 2013.  An Appeals Officer upheld the original decision to disallow the application and the appeal was disallowed on the 16th of April 2013.  Following the receipt of further medical evidence, the file was subsequently recalled by the Social Welfare Appeals Office and was returned to them on 30th of April 2013.

Its findings were discussed with national and European stakeholders at a conference last December.  The purpose of the study is to provide new insights into the relationship between work, unemployment and poverty, which has assumed greater importance with the economic recession and the subsequent rise in unemployment.<\/p><p>  A particular focus of the study was on the EU concept of jobless households, defined as households where the total time allocated to work by working age adults is less than 20 per cent. The study found that the population aged 0 to 59 in jobless households rose from 13 per cent in 2005 to 22 per cent in 2010, which is twice the EU average. The high proportion of the population in jobless households reveals a structural problem that predates the current recession, though it has been exacerbated by the rise in unemployment. The severity of the problem in Ireland reflects a number of factors, namely, a higher percentage of the adult population who are not economically active; a greater likelihood that jobless adults live with other jobless adults, and a higher proportion of children living with adults in jobless households. Such households, in effect, contain adults who are furthest from the labour market and who generally have a strong pattern of educational and social class disadvantages. Furthermore, children in jobless households are at risk of inter-generational poverty.<\/p><p>  The main policy conclusion from this study is that the number of jobless households is a key factor in determining overall levels of poverty and social exclusion. Social transfers play a key role in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate among jobless households and, compared to other EU countries, are considerably more effective in reducing poverty. Despite this, jobless households still experience higher levels of basic deprivation and consistent poverty and account for two-thirds of the total population in consistent poverty.<\/p><p>  To address the issue, the Government, as part of the national social target to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent of less by 2020, has agreed to set a sub-target to reduce the share of jobless households in consistent poverty.  The key to ensuring that the target will be addressed is an active labour market policy. A Programme for Government priority for 2013 is to make sure that economic recovery does not bypass jobless households, by enhancing the Pathways to Work strategy to ensure new jobs go to people on the Live Register. The Government is implementing a number of actions which will have a positive impact on jobless households including (i) the new integrated employment and support service (Intreo); (ii) streamlining and restructuring of working age supports; (iii) improving labour market measures to assist those furthest from the labour market, in particular the long-term unemployed; and (iv) an area-based response to child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600061#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600061#WRP02050"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[23578\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600061#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of Intreo offices that are currently operational; the number that she or her Department plan to open in the future; if when these will be opened; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>The Pathways to Work document states that the introduction of the new Intreo service is a multi-annual project with all Department Local Offices upgraded to full Intreo offices by the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  The delivery of the Intreo service comprises a number of elements. the main elements being:<\/p><p>i.

As part of this initiative a city in Ireland is selected and designated as a National City of Culture every two years, with the designation itself lasting for one calendar year.  Limerick City will be first National City of Culture in 2014 giving the City an opportunity to shape and brand the new Limerick.<\/p><p><br \/>  Limerick City is undergoing a process of profound change at present and 2014 is an important year for the city as it will be the year in which a new single local authority will be established.  The Limerick Reorganisation Implementation Group (LRIG) is preparing for this change, and I believe that the designation of Limerick as a City of Culture will help to shape, brand and promote a new Limerick city.<\/p><p><br \/>  Limerick's preparations are well underway with former European Parliament President Pat Cox leading the initiative, joined by two other internationally renowned Freemen of Limerick.  These are Riverdance composer Bill Whelan and rugby international Paul O'Connell. I understand that proposals from interested applicants for 2014 are now being accepted by LRIG.  Further details are available <\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of the National City of Culture Initiative is to deliver a programme of cultural events and engagement in a city for one calendar year and to build a longer-term positive impact.  The National City of Culture Initiative will seek to bring artists, arts organisations, local authorities and civic groups that are working in a city together not only through the design of a calendar of events that showcases all that the city has to offer in arts and cultural expression, but also to generate a legacy in cultural co-operation among all the citizens of the city.  There are a number of excellent galleries, theatres and museums operating in Limerick and these venues will play an important role in the 2014 programme of events. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am awaiting a proposed programme of events for 2014 from the LRIG. As soon as I have received this proposed programme, the question of funding will be considered.  <\/p><p><br \/>  An EU study in 2004 found that the designation of European Capital of Culture served as a catalyst for the cultural development and transformation of the chosen city, and it is aimed to replicate these benefits on the national stage through this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600063#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600063#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[23433\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600063#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if funding will be reimbursed to a sports club (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>To date, payments in respect of the improvement works have been made based on the expenditure submitted to my Department.

A further 3,534 letters and site-packs  were issued to persons potentially affected by the proposed designations in 2002 of the remaining raised bog sites. These letters included maps of the sites, as well as details of restrictions to activities therein, compensation provisions, and the manner in which an objection might be made to the proposed designation. <\/p><p>  My Department sources its information for issuing letters from a number of sources, including the Property Registration Authority, the Land Commission (now Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine), the Land Parcel Identification System used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine,  and the electoral register. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the development of the Land Direct system by the Property Registration Authority in recent years has allowed much more comprehensive land-owner identification. This has improved the Department&rsquo;s ability to reach as many interested parties as possible.  While every reasonable step has been taken over the years to identify landowners and notify them directly, it is not possible to guarantee that all such persons can be identified.  It is commonplace, particularly in bogs, that individuals&rsquo; interests are not registered at all, or not in their own names.

This represents a major breakthrough in the negotiations and represents a considerable success for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.<\/p><p>  The new position drafted by the Council of Ministers is based on a revised 200 page compromise legal text which I presented to Fisheries Ministers early on Wednesday morning and I greatly welcome the support received from my EU Ministerial colleagues. This agreement follows very difficult and complex negotiations and amounts to a significant step forward on behalf of EU Fisheries Ministers. It enables further crucial negotiations with the European Parliament to take place which will hopefully lead to an agreed package of significant reforms being agreed in the coming weeks. This decision by the Council is a major conciliatory step in the direction of the European Parliament&rsquo;s own position on the reforms and should hopefully pave the way for successful conclusion of the complex inter-institutional negotiations on the reform. It is evidence of the importance placed by Fisheries Ministers on ensuring that this radical package of measures is finally agreed. <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency has prioritised securing CFP reform before the end of its term and three-way talks (trilogues) between the Council, European Parliament and Commission will now continue with the aim of achieving that goal on the basis of this new position drafted by the Council of Ministers. The Council has recognised the practical challenges for fishermen and the potential socio-economic impacts in coastal communities during the negotiations over the past number of months. I believe that the historical package agreed with the Council of Ministers this week will prepare the way for a European wide discards ban, facilitate more sustainable fishing levels in addition to appropriate management of fleet capacity and a lead to a workable regionalisation policy. It will provide the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry. The package agreed this week will allow us to rebuild fish stocks in European waters and will allow for setting TACs and quotas to reflect catches when a landing obligation is introduced on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock no longer be allowed. In the longer term as fish stocks reach and are maintained at healthy levels, it will support increased fishing opportunities for our fishermen. <\/p><p>  It is important to emphasise that we are under no illusions as to the scale of the final challenge facing us in securing agreement with the European Parliament. The strong compromise mandate given to me this week however places a responsibility on our co-legislators in the European Parliament to show reciprocal flexibility to facilitate a successful conclusion on the Common Fisheries Policy reforms, which is the objective of both institutions. I remain cautiously optimistic that final agreement can be secured by the end of the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Negotiations","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV01750"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[23544\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the outcome of discussions at the 13-14 May meeting of the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council regarding the Common Agricultural Policy as part of the trilogue with the European Parliament and European Commission on CAP Reform during the Irish Presidency; when he expects that co-decision on this matter will be complete; if he expects it will be concluded during the Irish Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>I used the opportunity of this week&rsquo;s Council of EU Agriculture Ministers to bring Member State colleagues up to date with the progress of trilogue discussions with the Commission and the European Parliament on reform of the CAP.  I outlined the positive and constructive nature of the negotiations between the three institutions, with good progress made on a number of issues across all four CAP reform dossiers. However, I drew Ministers&rsquo; attention to the fact that, notwithstanding this forward movement, the three institutions hold quite different views in a number of areas. These will require political input to resolve if the reform package is to be agreed by the end of June. <\/p><p>  We had a discussion on some of the issues that have already presented themselves as politically sensitive in the course of the trilogue discussions. The first of these relates to the definition of &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo;, and particularly the concept of a &lsquo;negative list&rsquo; of entities which would not be considered active farmers and would therefore not receive direct payments under the reformed CAP. Member States want such a negative list to be a voluntary provision, while the European Parliament would prefer it to be mandatory. <\/p><p>  The second issue relates to the proposed young farmers&rsquo; scheme. Again, the discussion focused on the question of whether this scheme should be mandatory or voluntary for Member States. The Council&rsquo;s view is that the scheme should be voluntary, while the Parliament prefers a mandatory approach. Similarly, on the small farmers&rsquo; scheme, although the Council and Parliament agree that the scheme should be voluntary for Member States, the discussion focused on whether a change proposed by the Commission would allow it to become a mandatory scheme for all Member States, which the Commission would strongly prefer.<\/p><p>  I was pleased with the exchanges on all three issues. Member States had been asked to consider how an agreement with the Parliament and Commission might be achieved and I noted a broad sense of flexibility and openness from Member States. <\/p><p>  The exchanges at Council represent the beginning of the final phase of negotiations and we are all conscious of the need for reasonable compromise if we are to get a deal agreed by the end of June. That requires movement from all three institutions and not just from the Council. I do not underestimate the efforts that will be required by all three institutions if we are to achieve our target but I am satisfied, based on progress to date, that we are on track to achieve political agreement between the three institutions on reform of the CAP by the end of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV01950"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[23550\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600067#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will extend the closing date for single farm payment applications in view of the impact the current weather conditions are having on normal farm practices and the decision by his Department not to allow applications to be accepted in local departmental offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>Under the governing EU Regulations, which are directly applicable in the State, the latest date for receipt of applications under the Single Payment Scheme is 15 May; therefore, I do not have any latitude available to me to extend this date. <\/p><p>  While the level of applications in respect of the 2013 Scheme received by midnight last night has yet to be definitely tallied, it is clear that the vast majority of applications were received by my Department on time.

The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is currently progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place, including in the greater Dublin area, and are operating successfully.<\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status.  Clinical Status 1 (Echo) calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin, while Clinical Status 1 (Delta) calls involve life-threatening emergencies other than cardiac or respiratory. The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle. With effect from January 2012, HIQA set the standard at 75% within the target time for first responders and a target has been set at 80% within the target time for patient-carrying vehicles.<\/p><p>  The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve emergency responses.

Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualifications for public health and safety and consumer protection.  In certain circumstances, non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in Ireland can benefit from the provisions of the Directive.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, as is the case with Psychology at present, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the public health sector.  <\/p><p>  The Directive provides for mutual recognition of qualifications for certain professions.  In the case of the health and social care professions, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600070#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":740,"content":"<p>Question No. 270 answered with Question No. 248.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[23536\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051600070#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will issue a special services medical cards to cover all medical treatments, medications, general practitioner and consultant visits in respect of persons suffering from Narcolepsy disorder; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":743,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.
