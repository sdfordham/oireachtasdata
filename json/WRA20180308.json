Most of these people have settled in refugee camps that have existed in the region since the early 1990s where conditions are precarious and ongoing international efforts will be required to sustain those living in the camps.  An estimated 120,000 Rohingya remain in Northern Rakhine and humanitarian access there has been heavily restricted.<\/p>  <p>  The exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages. Recent allegations of the existence of mass graves within Rakhine State have also emerged, which is deeply concerning.  <\/p>  <p>  As access to the region remains restricted, independent confirmation of these reports remains challenging but they absolutely reinforce the need for the Myanmar authorities to heed the calls by the international community for access to the area by humanitarian workers and the media in order to assess and verify what has occurred in the region especially since last August.<\/p>  <p>  It also reinforces the importance of the role being played by the U.N. special envoy on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, who has said that the military's operations against the Rohingya bear \"the hallmarks of a genocide\". <\/p>  <p>  There has been widespread international condemnation of the actions of the Myanmar Security Forces in Rakhine State and the international community is continuing to press for a positive and long-term solution to the situation in Rakhine State, including for the Rohingya community, and for the large number of refugees who are now situated in Bangladesh.  For our part, Ireland has sought to deploy political pressure with the aim of easing the crisis through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, Ireland was an active participant in the formulation of new EU Council Conclusions on Myanmar adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, and call for the implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The conclusions also call for the voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees to Myanmar.  The new Council conclusions invite High Representative\/Vice-President Mogherini to make proposals for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for serious human rights violations.  I would like to express my support of these conclusions and hope that the forthcoming proposals will send a clear message to those in military control in Myanmar.<\/p>  <p>  At the UN, the 37th Session of the UN Human Rights Council is currently ongoing in Geneva where the situation in Myanmar is one of the main topics of discussion.  The Council will receive an update from UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee as well as the UN mandated independent international fact-finding mission.  Minister of State Cannon addressed the Council on 27th  February and outlined Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing concerns in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the international community are also continuing to support the humanitarian response to the refugee crisis.  In October 2017, the EU hosted a Pledging Conference on the Rohingya Refugee Crisis in Geneva where Ireland pledged &euro;2 million in direct support.  We provided &euro;1 million 2017, and an additional &euro;1 million has been allocated for 2018.

I met with Mr Barnier on a number of occasions since taking office, most recently in Brussels on 26 February, in advance of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 27 February.  Mr Barnier gave me an overview of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which was published two days later, on 28 February.  We spoke in detail about the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the proposed withdrawal agreement.  The draft protocol gives legal effect to the commitments agreed in December&rsquo;s EU-UK Progress Report on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. It also includes elements on rights and on the Common Travel Area.  Since they were agreed in December, we have been working closely with the Task Force to ensure that commitments and guarantees provided by the UK are reflected faithfully in draft Withdrawal Agreement.  I took the opportunity to express our satisfaction to Mr Barnier with how this process was managed.  <\/p><p>I also reiterated to Mr Barnier, the Government&rsquo;s preference to resolve the Irish-specific issues through the wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK.  We agreed that while both Ireland and the EU stand ready to consider proposals from the UK on specific solutions, it is necessary to have legal certainty on the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  This is a default and will only be triggered if the commitments made by the UK in phase one cannot be delivered through the wider future relationship agreement or specific solutions.<\/p><p>The draft Withdrawal Agreement also sets out the legal terms of the transition period, which will be hugely important for Ireland in giving certainty to individuals and businesses.  We welcome that the EU has proposed that the whole of the EU <i>acquis<\/i>will apply during the transition, which means that the status quo will be preserved with the aim of avoiding any gaps or cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and when a future relationship agreement enters into force.<\/p><p>Michel Barnier&rsquo;s comment on the transition period reflects that fact that the negotiations between the EU and the UK on the transition period, which is an integral part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, are progressing but have yet to be completed.  I welcome that these discussions are proceeding at pace.  The EU Task Force will provide an update on progress to the Member States following the latest round of negotiations, which conclude this week. <\/p><p>The European Council was clear in December that negotiations in phase two, which includes transitional arrangements, can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken in phase one are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms.  As transitional arrangements are an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement, agreement on transition will depend on agreement on the entire Withdrawal Agreement, including on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The aim is to conclude the withdrawal agreement by October and this is why it is important the UK engages positively with the Commission&rsquo;s draft in the coming weeks and months.  However, I am hopeful that the European Council in March will be in a position to register good progress on agreeing the fundamental elements of the transitional arrangements as proposed by the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Oversight","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[11570\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which information is available in respect of links between major financial investment corporations or banking institutions with national or international aid agencies; if the agencies involved have been audited in recent times; if such links might indicate a conflict of interest; if there are other implications in the context of aid for trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[11571\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB02150","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which major private contributors to international aid organisations have secured an understanding for a quid pro quo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council.

The conflict, which is now in its seventh year, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighboring countries and the wider region. The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta which has cost the lives of hundreds of civilians, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.  Ireland and the EU support the UN-led Geneva peace process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.  I was present at a UN Security Council briefing on Syria in New York in late February, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations.  I fully support those calls.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.  In addition, the EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April of this year.  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country, and &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland providing &euro;22.9 million. <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has also committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region. To date, almost 2,000 people have already arrived. <\/p>  <p>  In Iraq, the UN estimates that 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the country begins to recover from the atrocities committed by Da&rsquo;esh.  The current number of internally displaced persons requiring humanitarian assistance stands at almost 3.3 million, of which 1.6 million are living outside of camps in host communities.  In addition, there are an estimated 240,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq. The EU is working to support the Iraqi government on stabilisation and reconciliation.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, Ireland has provided over &euro;8 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, including &euro;2 million in 2017 for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.  Via our annual contributions to the EU budget, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the situation in Iraq, which amounts to &euro;650 million since 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The situations in both Syria and Iraq were discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels in December. At the Foreign Affairs Council in January, Foreign Ministers adopted the new EU strategy for engagement with Iraq, and initiated a formal exchange on migration with Iraq.  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting in February of this year, and at the February Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  Through the EU, Ireland has long advocated for and supported the development of durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons, and in tackling the root causes of displacement.  Through our engagement with conflict-affected countries, refugee hosting countries and our EU counterparts, Ireland supports conflict resolution and development in Syria, Iraq and the wider region. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[11581\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia continue to receive cooperation and support from the European Union; the extent to which Ireland's trade with such countries can be enhanced post Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The Eastern Partnership Initiative provides a framework for cooperation between the EU and six countries in the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Neighbourhood, including Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia.

The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU.  The fifth Eastern Partnership Summit which took place on 24 November 2017 adopted a roadmap setting out future priorities for the initiative, entitled &ldquo;Eastern Partnership - 20 Deliverables for 2020\".  A range of short and long-term milestones including improving connectivity, energy efficiency, support to SMEs, engaging with youth and a broadened outreach to civil society are identified.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is committed to assisting Ukraine in delivering its ambitious and wide-ranging programme of reform and has provided unprecedented levels of support.  This assistance includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, technical assistance as well as important trade preferences, granted under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 2016. In addition, the EU is helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU continues to support diplomatic efforts to secure full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the four year conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The High Representative is travelling to Ukraine on 12 March in advance of a discussion on Ukraine at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council.

In December EU Foreign Ministers had the opportunity to reiterate this during an informal breakfast meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel before the Foreign Affairs Council.The EU side used the meeting to underline to PM Netanyahu our key concerns about the Middle East Peace Process and the occupation, including actions by his government that we consider to be unhelpful or indeed unacceptable.  We also reiterated that our position on Jerusalem has not changed &ndash; that it must be the capital of two states, following an agreement between the parties on all of the final status issues.  In this context, I raised the need for a freeze on settlement construction, and pressed Israel on the issue of a two-state solution.<\/p>  <p>  I also raised a number of specific concerns about the occupation with the Israeli authorities during my visit to the region in January of this year. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that these opportunities for dialogue are extremely useful, including as an opportunity to raise issues of concern. <\/p>  <p>  The Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, or BDS, in relation to Israel.  I firmly believe that such an approach is counter-productive, and that it will not help to increase ordinary Israelis' understanding of the sound basis for international concern about the impact of the occupation.  Such an all-encompassing policy also conflates the State of Israel, on the one hand, and illegal settlements on Palestinian land, on the other.  I believe it is important to be clear on the distinction between the two, and I know that many Israeli citizens are also opposed to the construction of settlements. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the decision taken by Israel to exclude members of certain groups supporting BDS, I believe that this action also does not help to build a better mutual understanding or to move the situation forward. Israel is of course entitled to decide who it allows into its territory, as is any other state.  However, I believe that excluding people simply for critical opinions they hold is not the usual practice of a democracy.  Moreover, such exclusions also have the effect of denying people access to the occupied Palestinian territory which Israel controls. During my visit to the Middle East in January, I raised this issue directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu. <\/p>  <p>While the Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, it is a legitimate and non-violent political viewpoint, albeit one regarded in Israel as hostile, and   one that I fundamentally disagree with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[11690\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will use his influence diplomatically at all international levels to persuade Greece and Cyprus to withdraw from their planned agreement with Israel for the supply of gas.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>The recent discovery of gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean may make a contribution to efforts to enhance Europe&rsquo;s gas security of supply through diversification of routes and sources.

This represents the practical and logical outworking of the commitments made by the UK, including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also welcomed Prime Minister May&rsquo;s reiteration in her speech last Friday, of the UK&rsquo;s commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and to the agreement reached last December, including on avoiding a hard border.  These commitments need to be translated into concrete proposals and the Government looks forward to UK setting out its proposals in more detail in the Article 50 negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is of course acutely conscious that the Article 50 negotiations could impact on the urgent need to secure the formation of a new Executive.  The negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union are fundamentally political in nature, as is the formation of a power-sharing Executive and the operation of the devolved institutions. <\/p>  <p>  It is incumbent on all with responsibilities in both processes to work to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts can operate fully and effectively, consistent with the resounding democratic endorsement of the Agreement by the people, North and South on this island, almost 20 years ago.<\/p>  <p>  That will remain the Government&rsquo;s unrelenting focus and solemn duty as a co-guarantor of the Agreement, as we continue to engage to address the impact of the UK exit for the island of Ireland and support the urgent resumption of the devolved institutions in Belfast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06600"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[11620\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of flood insurance reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of\u00a0flood insurance\u00a0cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons why the Government has been prioritising\u00a0investment\u00a0in flood defences over the last number of years.  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.\u00a0Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in this process.<\/p>  <p>  My Department carried out a review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report, as approved by Government in November 2016.  As part of the review, a number of possible approaches were examined including those in other jurisdictions.  For example, an\u00a0Insurance Pool with State Indemnification similar to Flood Re in the UK\u00a0was considered, however it was concluded that such an approach would\u00a0lead to additional levies being imposed on all household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and\u00a0could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  The review recommended the continuation of the existing policy approach which has been in place since 2010, and confirmed by Government again in November 2016.  This policy is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.\u00a0This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.\u00a0To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Directly related to the above is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the OPW that the\u00a0finalised Flood Risk Management Plans were\u00a0submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Summer 2017\u00a0for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  Having now received the outcomes of the independent review, the Commissioners of Public Works expect in the coming weeks to formally submit the Flood Risk Management Plans\u00a0for my\u00a0approval.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.\u00a0 In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB06900"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[10836\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800039#WRB07000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the Central Bank's Code of Practice on the Transfer of Mortgages is not enforceable (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that the Code of Practice on the Transfer of Mortgages was issued by the Central Bank\u00a0in 1991 to institutions involved in mortgage credit and it is a voluntary code.<\/p><p>It may be applied on a voluntary basis by any institution involved in mortgage credit.

Many of these account holders have made no payments at all for years. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the bank confirmed that Project Glas also includes some loans which are currently subject to agreed forbearance measures, but which remain categorised as NPLs and this, therefore needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  For clarity, I should highlight for the deputy that I cannot stop loan sales by the banks, nor can I interfere with the composition of such sales. This applies even for the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. Their independence is also protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. Loan sales do not require my consent, though the banks are required to formally consult with me if the disposals are of a sufficient scale. In the case of the PTSB loan sale, the bank has not yet consulted with me but will do so in due course.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that no loan has been sold yet and it won&rsquo;t be known how many loans will be sold for a number of months, nor the composition of these loans. In addition, it is not known to whom the loans will be sold. However, I want and expect PTSB to be transparent with their customers when it comes to this sale process as it evolves.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. The customer is in the exact same position as they were before their loan was sold. In relation specifically to restructured loans, including splits, any purchaser will be obliged to honour the terms of the restructure agreement, should such loans be included in the final sale. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the protections currently in place, I have made it clear that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other\u00a0parties\u00a0in an effort to see if we can strengthen and enhance the protections, in a sensible manner, that are already\u00a0in place for mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>In relation to its powers, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach is entitled to request an explanation or confirmation from any of the banks on any matter and I would expect such a request to be dealt with to the satisfaction of the Committee. The Deputy may be aware that the Committee invited PTSB to attend a meeting on 27th February to discuss Project Glas. In its response to the Committee, the bank highlighted that it was not appropriate for executives to attend a meeting on the date proposed, as the bank is currently in a closed period ahead of the publication of its annual results on 14th March. However, the bank did state it was agreeable to meeting with the Committee on an alternative date sometime after 14th   March. I understand that PTSB is awaiting a response from the Committee with a proposed alternative date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[11141\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the actions being considered by his Department to reduce the cost of motor insurance for drivers; and when he expects to bring forward further proposals which will have an immediate impact on prices.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note at the outset that in my role as Minister for Finance I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. \u00a0Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance\u00a0was published in January 2017.\u00a0 That Report made 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, as set out in\u00a0the Action Plan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector. \u00a0This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The fourth such update was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 20 February 2018 and shows that of the 46 separate deadlines set during 2017 within the Action Plan, 39 have been met.\u00a0 Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with the\u00a0implementation of the Working Group's Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance &ndash; which was published in January 2018 &ndash; will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.\u00a0 I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for January 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 17% since peaking in July 2016.\u00a0 While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.\u00a0 However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Repayments","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[11167\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consult with the head of the Central Bank to confirm the way in which the mortgage accounts of customers who have renegotiated terms and are repaying the mortgage under these terms can be classed as non-performing; the efforts being made to ensure that customers that continue to meet their commitments are protected from the possibility of their account being sold on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>Since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014, the focus has shifted from reducing mortgage arrears levels to reducing Non-performing Loans (NPLs).

In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely. While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.\u00a0 Banks may be able to reduce their NPLs to levels acceptable to the SSM without the requirement for loan sales and\/or the loan sales involving restructured mortgages.<\/p><p>I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that as per the EBA Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting and the ECB Guidance on non-performing loans, non-performing exposures are those that satisfy either or both of the following criteria:<\/p><p>1.material exposures which are more than 90 days past-due;<\/p><p>2.the debtor is assessed as unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full without realisation of collateral, regardless of the existence of any past-due amount or of the number of days past due.<\/p><p>There are instances where an exposure can remain a non-performing exposure, notwithstanding the fact that there are agreed forbearance terms with a lender and the borrower is meeting those terms.

Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.\u00a0 Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. <\/p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.\u00a0 Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.<\/p><p>Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012(the Code) requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its &lsquo;regulated activities&rsquo; to another regulated entity, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers. \u00a0Specifically, a lender must provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity. Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the name of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity. \u00a0In the event that there is a change in the credit servicing firm, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code.<\/p><p>A Government Decision last week agreed to support the FF Private Members Bill in relation to the regulation of loan owners.\u00a0 The Government will work with Deputy McGrath and the House to improve the Bill, with a view to addressing any difficulties that might arise with it as currently drafted.

Growth is broad based with net exports also contributing positively to growth in the first three quarters.<\/p>  <p>  The strength of underlying domestic demand is being felt in the labour market. Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.8 per cent recorded in the first three quarters of 2017, representing the creation of almost 60,000 additional jobs. <\/p>  <p>  Data published in the first quarter of this year indicate that:<\/p>  <p>  - Expansion in the manufacturing\u00a0\u00a0and services sectors continued in February with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo;\u00a0 Index for the sectors recording their fifty seventh and sixty seventh\u00a0 successive month of expansion respectively. <\/p>  <p>  - The Consumer Sentiment Index was 110.4 in January, well above its long run average. <\/p>  <p>  - The seasonally adjusted monthly\u00a0unemployment rate for February was 6.0 per cent, down from 7.3 per cent in\u00a0February 2015.\u00a0 As a result, the\u00a0unemployment rate has fallen by almost two thirds since its peak of 16 per cent in early-2012.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent this year. The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term; my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created this year. Strong employment growth is expected to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of this year. The limited data so far available for 2018 has generally been positive and indicate that the momentum in the economy has been maintained. <\/p>  <p>  However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges, particularly for the traditional sector, the\u00a0tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has incorporated the estimated impact of a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts published as part of Budget 2018. This shock is projected to reduce GDP growth by approximately &frac34; of a percentage point on average per annum over the 2019-2021 period. These forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC). The Department will publish updated forecasts as part of the April 2018 Stability Programme Update.<\/p>  <p>  These projections were informed by Department of Finance &ndash; ESRI joint research which modelled the medium to long term impact of Brexit on Ireland.

Progress can also be seen in our improved international rankings. For example, Ireland ranks 6th in the IMD World Competitiveness Rankings. This compares to a ranking of 24th at the height of the crisis in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The restoration of Irish competitiveness since 2008 has been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.\u00a0This is all the more important given the significant economic risks we face both internationally and domestically. <\/p>  <p>  On the external side, the impact of Brexit is being felt through the strengthening of the euro against sterling. Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future. Other international risks include the policy stance in the US, including in relation to taxation. In terms of domestic risks to competitiveness, housing supply pressures are of particular concern. The housing sector can adversely impact on competitiveness through for example, restricting the mobility of labour.<\/p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties. With regard to housing, a number of initiatives were introduced in Budget 2018, in addition to the measures implemented in &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;,\u00a0 to tackle the underlying problem of\u00a0 a supply shortage:<\/p>  <p>  - Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) will boost the supply of debt funding to residential development. Utilising up to &euro;750 million from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, HBFI will fund new housing construction across all regions in the country. <\/p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;500 million was allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to build a further 3,000 social housing units by 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - An extra &euro;75 million is also being provided under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. <\/p>  <p>  - Budget 2018 included an increase to the rate applicable under the vacant site levy in the second and subsequent years of vacancy. This will provide a strong incentive to landowners to either develop their land or sell them for the purpose of development.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, competitiveness has improved but we must not be complacent. My Department will continue to monitor all relevant developments closely as we seek to ensure that the economy is best placed to weather economic shocks to the greatest extent possible. Competitiveness is an important factor in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC06100"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[11483\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800040#WRC06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to\u00a0which he remains in\u00a0contact with his EU counterparts to ensure the remaining 27 members states of\u00a0the\u00a0European Union are ad idem in respect of the need to maintain a co-ordinated approach in the context of the post-Brexit situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>Since the UK referendum outcome, I have met with my EU counterparts at the monthly Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings, with the next meeting scheduled for 12-13 March.

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;. Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).<\/p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  A Government Decision last week agreed to support the FF Private Members Bill in relation to the regulation of loan owners.\u00a0 The Government will work with Deputy McGrath and the House to improve the Bill, with a view to addressing any difficulties that might arise with it as currently drafted.<\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework. It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA. The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm. The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort. The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered. A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.<\/p>  <p>  Details on the protections and options available to a borrower under Irish personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie, should this be of relevance. This aspect of the framework of protections for individuals (including mortgage borrowers) is overseen by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, not the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from last weeks Government Decision as mentioned above, I\u00a0have also asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure it remains as effective as possible and for the review to be completed as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Finally in\u00a0relation to repossessions by those who purchase loan books (non-Banks), the following Central Bank data will be of interest to the Deputy.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - In 2015, the total Principal dwelling house (PDH) properties repossessed by Banks was 1,535, this was made up of 1,299 by Banks and 236 by Non-Banks.<\/p>  <p>  - In 2016, the total PDH properties repossessed by Banks was 1,693, this was made up of 1,452 by Banks and 241 by Non-Banks.<\/p>  <p>  - In 2017 (up to end September), the total PDH properties repossessed by Banks was 1,106, this was made up of 982 by Banks and 124 by Non-Banks.<\/p>  <p>  Across state agencies, there are numerous bodies and processes in place to assist those in mortgage arrears in the hope of avoiding repossession. The Abhaile service has been established and\u00a0offers help to\u00a0borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes. This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them. Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation. An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant. Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor. If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court. A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.<\/p>  <p>  A Helpline\u00a0is available Monday to Friday and\u00a0a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800041#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800041#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[11488\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800041#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he will introduce statutory rules appertaining to the code of conduct applicable to\u00a0primary and secondary lenders or their agents with a view to ensuring the protection of families that continue to pay their mortgage to the best of their ability or those that can demonstrate an ability to so do and the need to ensure that the housing crisis is not further exacerbated by the activities of venture capitalists with negative consequences of a social and economic nature; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.<\/p><p>The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.

An 18 Step Action Plan was developed in 2016 by the Government CIO in collaboration with the ICT Advisory Board.\u00a0 Good progress continues to be achieved in implementing the Action Plan and the Strategy which is now also reinforced by the eGovernment Strategy 2017-2020.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 was approved by Government and published in July 2017. \u00a0The Strategy is underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to be open, flexible and collaborative with our citizens and businesses, using digitisation and technology to increase efficiency and effectiveness and constantly improve public services. \u00a0Our eGovernment priorities will be taken forward through the delivery of 10 key actions.\u00a0 A particular focus of the implementation plan is a programme, put in place with public bodies, to progress the adoption of the Public Services Card and its online equivalent MyGovID which offers a single, secure way to verify people looking to avail of public services. \u00a0<\/p><p>The OGCIO is working with public bodies to take forward a significant programme of work related to implementing these strategies some elements of which are set out hereunder. \u00a0The first version of a government digital services portal,<i><\/i><i>,<\/i>was launched at the end of 2017 and provides an intuitive interface which acts as a simple signposting site to a catalogue of all Government digital services.\u00a0 In collaboration with the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Communications Unit, the service will continue to be developed, adding more information and functionality for citizens and businesses, and using appropriate consultation within Government and with other stakeholders, including the public and\/or their representatives.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, my officials are working to progress the Data Sharing and Governance Bill.\u00a0 The purpose of this Bill is to promote and encourage data-sharing between public bodies by providing a statutory framework for data sharing for legitimate and clearly specified purposes that are compliant with Data Protection legislation; and to improve the protection of individual privacy rights by setting new governance standards for data sharing by public bodies.\u00a0 Work is also ongoing to build on and promote the use of common data models across Government, such as the Public Service Identity dataset and Eircodes, that underpin our data protection obligations, the provision of digitised and streamlined services, and the linking of data to improve decision making.<\/p><p>In July 2017 the Open Data Strategy 2017-2022 was published which builds on the substantial achievements made in implementing the Open Data Initiative and sets out a roadmap for continued progress and development. \u00a0The concept of Open Data is about making data held by public bodies available freely and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.\u00a0 The initiative aims to create an environment where, by opening up Government data, new opportunities for research, innovation, transparency, engagement and greater efficiency are delivered and realised by public bodies, businesses, researchers and citizens.\u00a0 Measures to achieve this include a centralised Open Data portal, data.gov.ie, which provides access to official data in open format, development of a Technical Framework to underpin the publication of such data in line with best practice internationally and to ensure it is interoperable, establishment of an Open Data Governance Board to lead the initiative, outreach and engagement with public bodies and other stakeholders. \u00a0The deputy may wish to be aware that Ireland has achieved first place in the European Commission's Open Data Maturity assessment for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800041#WRD07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[10933\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the Public Service Pay Commission will produce its report on the unwinding of FEMPI legislation;

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. <\/p><p>The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including: <\/p><p>-  That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable. <\/p><p>-  That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods. <\/p><p>-  That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home. <\/p><p>-  That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme. <\/p><p>-  That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time. <\/p><p>-  That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.<\/p><p>At this time, in relation to those homeowners being considered under the scheme, the OPW is working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to consider approximately 70 homes that have been flooded during the event may benefit from a known or possible engineering solution. A further 31 homeowners have been contacted and\/or met by the OPW under the administrative arrangements for the scheme, of which the OPW is seeking further information from 7 of these homeowners. <\/p><p>Where it has been established that there is no viable engineering solution at this initial stage of assessment, the Local Authorities have contacted homeowners known to have flooded during the period in question.  These homeowners have been asked to make contact with the OPW in relation to being considered under the scheme. <\/p><p>The numbers of homes within the process are changing regularly as homeowners make contact with the OPW and as assessments are completed.  <\/p><p>The OPW has budgeted up to &euro;3m this year for the potential costs associated with this scheme. <\/p><p>Shannon Group &amp;amp; Lake Levels <\/p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group met on six occasions in 2016. During 2016, the primary focus of the Group was to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies and set out a Work Programme. In 2017, a number of sub-committees were established in accordance with the Group's Terms of Reference to progress the delivery of initiatives agreed by the Group. The Group met formally twice in 2017 with sub-committee and other bilateral meetings taking place more frequently as required. The Group will meet twice during 2018.<\/p><p>Information about the Group is available on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>The Group took a decision in October 2016 to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen, within the existing statutory framework, during the Winter 2016\/2017 to help mitigate potential flood risk.  A protocol was finalised between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW <\/p><p>to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metres with the first reduction implemented in October 2016. The trial has been repeated for the Winter 2017\/2018.<\/p><p>Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group <\/p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group, that I chair, met twice in 2015, four times in 2016, and once in 2017. The most recent meeting was held on 7thFebruary, 2018. <\/p><p>In November 2016, Government agreed an interim report from the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government. This report is available to view on the OPW website at<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>At the Group&rsquo;s most recent meeting, members reported on progress in their areas in national flood policy that included updates in relation to the National Adaptation Framework, published by Minister Denis Naughten T.D. on 19 January 2018 and the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme and the associated Flood Risk Management Plans. <\/p><p>National Flood Forecasting &amp;amp; Warning Service<\/p><p>A Steering Group has been established to steer, support and oversee the establishment of a new National Flood Forecasting Service. The Steering Group has met on fifteen occasions to date, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase and a development and trial phase. Work is now progressing on these phases. The service will deal with flood forecasting from fluvial (river) and coastal sources. When established it will involve the issuing of flood forecasts and general alerts.<\/p><p>Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take at least 5 years before it is fully operational and it is estimated it will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts. Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed two staff members to date to the project.<\/p><p>Individual Property Protection <\/p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group this year is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme. <\/p><p>The Group is being informed by two different pilot projects, in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo. The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures. <\/p><p>Both pilots are being funded through the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. In respect of the Kilkenny pilot, the OPW is funding the costs of a research and feasibility study into the potential provision of individual property protection.  Kilkenny County Council is considering the consulting engineers&rsquo; preliminary report to help inform recommendations to the OPW on the next stages of the pilot. To date the council have drawn down some &euro;30,000 towards the cost of the study. <\/p><p>In Crossmolina, consultants completed surveys of individual properties to assess their suitability for floodgates and Mayo County Council procured a contractor who is currently engaging with the community and installing the defences at the relevant properties. The OPW has provided some &euro;237,000 in funding to date for this pilot. <\/p><p>Minor Works<\/p><p>The review of the Minor Works Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme was completed in June 2017 which resulted in many improvements to the eligibility\/benefit criteria of the Scheme.<\/p><p>For example, the upper financial threshold has been increased substantially from &euro;500,000 to &euro;750,000 and benefit allowances have been updated to reflect different property types, with inclusion of farm yard\/buildings as commercial premises.<\/p><p>All Local Authorities were notified of the revised criteria, which are effective for applications received after 1 June 2017. The revised criteria are available onwww.opw.ie. <\/p><p>Riparian Guidance<\/p><p>The OPW will shortly be publishing on <i>www.flooding.ie<\/i>guidance to landowners in relation to the maintenance of watercourses on or near their lands in the context of managing flood risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE05200"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[11639\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress made in addressing the issue of pensions for community employment supervisors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 262 answered on 16 January 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":287,"content":"<p>Question No. 109 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[11684\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800042#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the funding allocated here to funds (details supplied) in each of the years 2014 to 2020; and the amount spent in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018 in tabular form including the breakdown between exchequer funding and EU funding to same.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has overall policy responsibility for the European Structural and Investment Funds.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes\u00a0I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs\u00a0and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.\u00a0 The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, under the terms of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required, within 3 months of the passing of the Act, to prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of\u00a0dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.

Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. In dealing with parents of children with special educational needs, SENOs will keep parents informed of what resourcing decisions are being made on their child&rsquo;s behalf. The SENO will also discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child. Contact details for all SENOs is available at .<\/p><p>As such, all pupils with learning difficulties have access to additional teaching support in school.\u00a0 It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p><p>On 1 September 2017, the new Special Education Teaching allocation model was introduced, which provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on a school&rsquo;s educational profile. This allocation allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.<\/p><p>The new allocation model gives greater flexibility to schools in relation to the manner in which they use their resources. Schools may deploy special education teachers in a variety of ways in order to effectively meet pupils&rsquo; needs, for example, in-class support, small groups, team teaching or withdrawal. \u00a0<\/p><p>The SNA scheme is designed to provide recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014. In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.

If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs\u00a0and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.

However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including the areas referred to by the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.<\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the surveys\u00a0consultations\u00a0took place\u00a0with the main Catholic patrons in\u00a0each\u00a0area to discuss patronage divesting options.\u00a0 Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened\u00a0where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result\u00a0of an amalgamation\/closure of an existing school.\u00a0 In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, the\u00a0Department expanded the scope\u00a0to include\u00a0an\u00a0examination of properties held in public ownership. <\/p>  <p>  To date, ten new schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.\u00a0 Of the five schools referred to by the Deputy, one is operating from a State-owned building and one is located in a former school building owned by the Catholic Church.\u00a0 In one area a property has transferred from the Catholic Church under the Redress process and arrangements are underway for the necessary works to be carried out in order for the Educate Together school to operate from here.

The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the statutory protections regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.<\/p><p>Since its establishment in 2013, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI)\u00a0has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt. In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes. This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days.<\/p><p>In addition, the solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have served as a catalyst for over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.<\/p><p>The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the personal insolvency legislation. These include the section 115A court review process and\u00a0the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.<\/p><p>The section 115A court review process permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a rejected PIA and, where satisfied as to its reasonableness, make an order confirming the PIA proposal.\u00a0 This removes the so-called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Government agreed late last year to bring forward its own proposals in a Courts and Land and Conveyancing Bill derived from a Private Member's Bill proposed by the then Deputy 'Boxer' Moran.\u00a0 This Bill is on the present legislative programme for publication during the current session.<\/p><p>Another important enhancement is Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. This was introduced in 2016 to ensure that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a personal insolvency practitioner. In addition to detailed financial advice, Abhaile offers legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible.<\/p><p>Up to 5 March, 2018, Abhaile had provided 8,389 vouchers for free financial advice and help from a personal insolvency practitioner.\u00a0 In addition, 2,308 borrowers had been issued consultation solicitor vouchers under the scheme. This voucher entitles a person to a free legal advice consultation with a solicitor.\u00a0 The scheme also provides for funding by the Legal Aid Board of these applications for review to the Circuit Court where a personal insolvency arrangement has been voted down by creditors.\u00a0 Up to 23 February 2018, legal aid had been approved under the Abhaile scheme for 607 such reviews.<\/p><p>In 2017, the Government introduced a series of actions and amendments that will make Mortgage to Rent\u00a0(MTR) quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgage distress. Crucially, the changes will also dramatically increase the numbers of households availing of the scheme<\/p><p>My Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts. The review is taking place under section 141 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which requires the Minister for Justice and Equality (in consultation with the Minister for Finance) to review the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act, and responds to a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p><p>Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation on the operation of Part Three of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 contain a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the personal insolvency system. These submissions are being analysed and considered by my Department as part of the review along with recent developments in personal insolvency, including recent High Court judgments related to the process.

The question to the then Minister for Justice and Equality related to whether host families were at liberty to enter into cultural exchange programmes. Accordingly, the question was responded to in the context of the traditional interpretation and understanding of the au pair arrangement as a private, voluntary, and shared understanding between the parties concerned - i.e. between a private household or sponsor family and a private individual. The basic premise of the question to the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was in relation to persons engaged in employment and potential abuses arising therein. The response to that question makes it clear that the determination of\u00a0 whether there is a contract of employment or not, was not based on the title of &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; per se but rather by reference to employment legislation and contract law. It went on to state that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) would examine any complaint received in the light of the facts of each case.<\/p>  <p>  The meaning of au pairs has evolved over time, particularly following\u00a0a ruling of the WRC in 2016.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0persons who work as au pairs are entitled to the full protection of employment legislation in an employer-employee relationship and this is governed under the employment permit regulations of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  The finding of the WRC, as I understand it, is that an individual working as an au pair is deemed to be an employee, with the entitlements that go with that status, including payment of at least\u00a0the minimum wage.\u00a0\u00a0 While there has traditionally been a social and cultural dimension to work as an au pair, which presumably can continue into the future, this cannot alter the entitlements of individuals deemed to be employees.\u00a0 This applies irrespective of the immigration arrangements under which they are resident in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  My remit in this area is limited to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals and in that context, as far as the immigration aspects of this issue are concerned, a non-EEA national would not be granted immigration permission for the\u00a0primary purpose of being an au pair.\u00a0 Furthermore, I understand that such employment would not be eligible for an employment permit from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.\u00a0\u00a0 Persons on student permission with an Immigration Stamp 2 are, however,\u00a0entitled to engage in casual work for up to 40 hours per week during the months June to September and\u00a0for a 4-week period from mid-December to mid-January.\u00a0 Outside that time the limit is 20 hours per week.\u00a0 Working as an \"au pair\" within those temporal limits is not forbidden but such work is subject to employment law and the various entitlements that employees have, and the responsibilities that an employer has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800046#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800046#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[11206\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800046#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; by rank, including probationer garda&iacute;, in each Garda division as of December 2017; if recruits from the Garda Training College have been deployed in 2018; and if so, the districts to which.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, the first 200 of whom will pass out of the Garda College next week and be assigned to locations around the country. Further attestations are planned for June, September and November which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; as of 31 December 2017 by rank and Division is as set out in the following table.<\/p><p><b>GARDA STRENGTH BY DIVISION AND RANK 31 DECEMBER 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>DIVISION<\/th><th>GD*<\/th><th>SG<\/th><th>IN<\/th><th>SU<\/th><th>CS<\/th><th>AC<\/th><th>TOTAL<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  On 02 January 2018, I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for tackling crime, including rural crime. While it is open to private security firms to operate a business where such a demand exists, it is important to stress that it should not interfere with the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any way. There are no funding schemes at present operated by my Department which are specifically aimed at private security businesses.  However, in general terms, the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Galway may be able to offer further guidance in respect of establishing a new business.  Details of the services provided by LEOs and the contact details for same are available at: www.localenterprise.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Prosecutions","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[11471\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 189 of 15 May 2014, if this report has now been received; the actions that have been taken following its receipt; if the publication will now be made available to the victims should they request same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>I understand that my predecessor, in response to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question in 2014, outlined that following an investigation in this matter, the Garda authorities forwarded a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) where it was directed that there be no prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  Given the passage of time, and the possibility of further developments in this matter since 2014, I have sought an up-to-date report from the Garda authorities and I will contact him directly when this report is to hand. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Data","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[11542\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800047#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of proceedings in the court system involving mortgage arrears on PDH and BTL houses; the number of possession orders granted by the Circuit Court in each of years 2013 to 2017 and to date in 2018 on PDH houses and BTL houses; the number of possession orders granted by the High Court in each of the years 2013 to 2017 and to date in 2018 on PDH houses and BTL houses in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy in the time available.

With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  We aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and will shortly be published by Enterprise Ireland.  Several events have already taken place, including ministerial-led missions to the USA in January, and Mexico and Russia in February.  Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around world are organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests.  The Taoiseach and I will take part in a wide range of meetings and activities to promote Ireland and Irish business in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by Enterprise Ireland, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements opening new markets Irish Firm&rsquo;s goods and services and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and Mexico hope to reach political agreement early this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common sanitary and phytosanitary standards and sustainable development.  Ireland supports comparable trade conditions for investors and businesses across the Americas, making it easier for Irish businesses to trade in and enter these markets.  The main benefits for Ireland in a modernised agreement with Mexico would include the opening up of public procurement markets to Irish businesses and the removal of technical barriers to trade to reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market. It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be important for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy products where Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.

In addition, parties that make written submissions to the Court will subsequently be invited to a hearing on the matter at the Court where further oral submissions can be made to the Court.<\/p>  <p>  Following examination by the Court of the merits of the application against the criteria set down in the legislation, the Court can either decide to submit a recommendation to the Minister to adopt the proposal for a sectorial agreement by way of a Ministerial Order\u00a0or, it can decide not to submit a recommendation. <\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to examine the Labour Court recommendation\u00a0and to ensure that in its examination, the Court has taken account of the relevant criteria set down in the 2015\u00a0legislation. <\/p>  <p>  In the current instance of the\u00a0SEO affecting plumbers, pipefitters etc. the Labour Court recommendation was submitted to me\u00a0in December 2017.\u00a0 The Labour Court had\u00a0previously advertised the application presented to it by the UNITE and TEEU trade unions in the national media and invited submissions in July 2017.

Nearly 28% of persons engaged work in micro companies (under 10 employees) but these companies accounted for over 92% of the 249,000 businesses in Ireland.

Through the utilisation of existing infrastructure and the leveraging of nationally available enterprise supports, the specific objectives of the scheme include:<\/p><p>- Fostering an increased collaborative, networked and linked approach to regional and local enterprise development and job creation.<\/p><p>- Establishment of hubs, accelerators, networks and clusters or other partnerships based on regional strengths, opportunities and uniqueness.<\/p><p>- Proactively seeking out, encouraging and supporting applications from economically disadvantaged areas. <\/p><p>- Promotion of a progression pathway for companies as they start, develop and scale.<\/p><p>The above-mentioned initiatives alongside the Community Enterprise Centres and the networking organisations outlined can help to alleviate potential loneliness and isolation in the SME sector.

Business people who join these organisations will benefit not only from rich business connections but also the social aspect and connectivity that shared working spaces bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01005"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[11365\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01009","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied that breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 identified by NERA in 2010 regarding sleep over shifts in the social care sector have been adequately resolved and that employees affected have been fully compensated for underpayments.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[11366\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01018","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the levels of underpayment of minimum wage to employees working sleep over shifts in the social care sector which were established by NERA in each of the years 2010 to 2017 respectively; and the level of repayment of arrears which has been secured by the inspectorate on behalf of employees affected.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[11367\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01027","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures taken between 2010 and 2017 to ensure against breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in the social care sector specifically with reference to sleep over shift payments; the further steps she plans to take in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[11368\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800048#WRL01036","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 261 of 20 February 2018, the proportion of the unpaid wages recouped for employees which applies to the social care sector in which employees were underpaid for sleep over shifts.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 to 245, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that policy responsibility for the social care sector and the issue of payment of overnight workers in that sector is a matter that comes within the remit of the Minister for Health and is a matter that is I understand, being dealt with by that Department. <\/p><p>As I mentioned in my earlier reply to the deputy on 20 February last, the Department of Health, the HSE, Social Care employers and unions are participating in a conciliation process led by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) on the issue of time spent on sleepovers services in the social care sector.

These include the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. <\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. <\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. <\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. <\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 5 March 2018, there have been 5,156 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis.

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.<\/p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to patient and recoup this amount from the GP.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the\u00a0health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the\u00a0localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. <\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. <\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. <\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. <\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.\u00a0 If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient. \u00a0The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 5 March 2018, there have been 5,156 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis. Of these applications, over 17%, or 896 patients, have been approved.<\/p><p>In addition, 437 online appeals have been made, and over 66% of these patients have been approved. The MMP has sought further information on 40 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.<\/p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,182 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.<\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website.  <i>().<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Support for eHealth and the E.H.R. programme is a key recommendation in the Sl&aacute;inteCare Report which advocated &ldquo;continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system\".\u00a0 eHealth deployment also forms part of the recently published National Development Plan where Project Ireland 2040 states that \"The National Development Plan will support the provision of digital health services, including the development of electronic health records in many health care settings such as the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital over the 10-year implementation timescale and reflects what was envisaged in the eHealth strategy for Ireland.\" Details of the eHealth elements of the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare will be announced shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made with the\u00a0implementation of the Health Identifiers Act 2014, which provides for a system of unique identification for patients, professionals and providers. On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed, allowing for the implementation of the I.H.I. for patients.\u00a0The technical implementation project of the IHI has begun with a roll-out for the integration of the identifier into various ICT systems nationally on a phased basis across health services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the I.H.I., other national ICT systems are being introduced or standardised.\u00a0 For example, the Maternal and New-born system (MN-CMS) which is effectively our first national electronic patient record, has been phased-in to the Maternity Units in Kerry, Cork University Hospital, the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospital in\u00a0Dublin.\u00a0It continues to be\u00a0further\u00a0deployed nationally on a phased basis. Other systems such as the national laboratory system (MedLIS), the national oncology management system (MOCIS) and other systems such as eReferrals are being implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE are currently progressing with a health portal initiative which will provide patients with access to their information.\u00a0The initial focus of the health portal will be on maternity service users and will allow patients access to medical reports and upcoming appointments.\u00a0The range of services available will expand as the National E.H.R. Programme progresses.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring patients and health professionals have access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time, supports more effective decision-making on the part of clinicians, improves administrative efficiency and can also empower patients to be more informed and involved in their own care or treatment. However,\u00a0there must be a balance between using and sharing personal health information appropriately while continuing to protect rights to privacy and confidentiality. Patients must be assured at all times that their personal health information is handled legally, securely, efficiently and effectively in order to deliver the best possible care.\u00a0 The EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect in all member states in May, involves a single set of data protection and privacy rules and establishes a legal basis for the processing of personal data based on clear and uniform principles.\u00a0The GDPR will replace the current data protection rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data.<\/p>  <p>  Details of the national eHealth programme of work are available at www.ehealthireland.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800051#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Data","counter":917,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800051#WRO03900"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[11144\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800051#WRO04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of intermediate care vehicles deployed to 999 calls in the north east ambulance sub region in each of the years 2015 to 2018;

The Review is a multi-year project which is resulting in very significant changes to the way in which services and supports for people with disabilities are delivered in moving away from institutional models of care and service delivery to community based, person centred, models of service. The implementation of the recommendations in the VFM Review continues to be a priority in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2018.<\/p><p>The Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; proposes a new model of support in the community moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. <\/p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.\u00a0 The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2017, there were less than 2,400 people with a disability living in congregated settings. The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people from congregated settings in 2018 under its Service Plan. The HSE has established a subgroup, under the Value for Money Steering Group, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions that will be rolled out at a regional and local level, in full consultation with residents and their families. <\/p><p>To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP).

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; <\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800052#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":974,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800052#WRP02800"},{"type":"question","counter":975,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[11344\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800052#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children in CHO5 awaiting autism spectrum disorder diagnostic assessment for more than three, six, nine, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":976,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[11345\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800052#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children in County Wexford awaiting autism spectrum disorder diagnostic assessment for more than three, six, nine, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":977,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 355 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. <\/p>  <p>  There are claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  However, these claims have led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014\/15 to 72% in 2015\/16 and 51% in 2016\/17.  Provisional figures from the HSE indicate that HPV vaccine uptake rates increased in September\/October 2017 to 62% due to a comprehensive communications campaign for parents with support from a large number of key stakeholders e.g. the HPV alliance which currently has 37 organisations working together such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Marie Keating Foundation.<\/p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised in September 2006 both nationally and at EU level.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities. Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  <\/p>  <p>  Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that people receive accurate information from reliable sources in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes. The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800053#WRQ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Products Regulatory Authority","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800053#WRQ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1085,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[11688\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800053#WRQ06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the function of polysorbate 80 also known as Tween 80 and polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-20 mono-oleate in the Gardasil HPV Vaccine; the consideration that has been given by his Department that this has contributed towards increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier facilitating the passage of HPV-16-L 1 into the brain tissue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1086,"content":"<p>The information that the Deputy seeks with regard to polysorbate 80 is not readily available.

This Regulation included an amendment to EU Regulation 1307\/2013 regarding the number of years a successful applicant under the Young Farmers Scheme (YFS) can receive payment.  The relevant amendment is in two parts.  The first part of the regulatory amendment provides that YFS applicants may receive payment for five years starting from the first submission of an application for payment, provided that the application takes place within five years of the commencement of farming.  This period of five years also applies to farmers who had received payment under the scheme in respect of applications prior to 2018.  The second part of the regulatory amendment provides that it is optional for Member States to extend the provision to young farmers who set up a holding in the period 2010-2013, and who had received payment under the YFS in respect of applications before the 2018 scheme year.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has applied the maximum 2% of the national ceiling to create a YFS fund of &euro;24 million annually.  Ireland has also utilised the option to overestimate the BPS ceiling in order to take account of unused YFS funds and this funding was used to allocate entitlements to young farmers and new entrants under the 2017 National Reserve.  Therefore the allocation of &euro;24 million is fully utilised in Ireland.  If Ireland opted to implement just the first part of the amended regulatory provision it would result in a windfall gain for some Young Farmers Scheme applicants who had commenced farming between 2010 and 2013 and who have already received payment based on the regulatory provisions applying at the time.  It is estimated that the additional cost of implementing just the first part of the regulatory amendment in Ireland would be in excess of &euro;5.5 million in 2018 and &euro;7.5 million in 2019 which would result in a requirement for a linear cut to all farmers&rsquo; basic payments in order to fund this additional spend under the Young Farmers Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Ireland will implement the relevant regulatory amendment of Regulation 2017\/2393 in full.  This will provide for a situation where with effect from the 2018 scheme year, successful applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who commenced farming from 2014 onwards and submit their first YFS application within five years of commencement of farming may receive payment under the YFS for five years.  <\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations provide for the operation of the Young Farmers Scheme from 2015 to 2019.

Because the storm occurred at this time of year it proved particularly disruptive as farmers coped with challenging weather conditions alongside the normal busy workload of spring; calving and lambing and winter feeding. The key on-farm challenges revolved around preventing the freezing up of water supplies at a critical time for lactating animals, the provision of fodder and shelter to stock against the worst of the snowfall and dangerous conditions for farmyards and environs. Delayed turn-out of some stock is increasing the demand for fodder and accommodation. In this regard it should be noted that the targeted, localised scheme to provide a subsidy for long distance transport of fodder is open and available to farmers affected by fodder shortages in the West and North West of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout this period and immediately afterwards\u00a0 Department staff, together with Teagasc worked at local level to ensure that the farming community had access to the best advice on how to cope with the numerous issues thrown up by the storm. To support those in more immediate difficulties the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine emergency phone line for animal welfare issues remained open and attended at all times. All requests for support were responded to.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant assistance the farming community provided within the wider local community at this busy time as they looked in on neighbours, cleared roads and helped to restore access to more remote rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  At sector level my Department worked closely with all stakeholders and with industry to minimise disruption to critical activities including milk collection services. I am happy to be able to report that all major issues were resolved in the shortest possible time thanks to the coordinated efforts of farmers, industry and my own Department staff.<\/p>  <p>  As the storm abated and the sector slowly returned to normal it became clear that the main problem centred on damage to horticulture and other on-farm structures. Such structures will principally be insured and it is important that insurance companies respond rapidly and flexibly to the needs of their farmers customers. It is important to emphasise that public support cannot be provided for insurable risks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to respond where possible to the issue of structural damage I believe that it is appropriate to consider what aspects can be addressed through on-farm investment support schemes operated by my Department and I have asked my officials to examine this as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800055#WRS06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800055#WRS06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1223,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[11646\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800055#WRS06600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 167 and 168 of 21 February 2018, when payment will issue to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1224,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS\u00a01 with a contract commencement date of 1\u00a0October 2015 and has received\u00a0payments in respect of 2015\u00a0and\u00a0the 2016 advance.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is aware of an issue with this case that\u00a0resulted in the subsequent payments not being made.

A-rated properties are the most energy efficient, and G-rated properties are the least energy efficient. A higher BER rating can indicate\u00a0lower energy bills and\u00a0higher levels of\u00a0warmth and comfort. A BER is calculated through energy use for space and hot water heating, ventilation and lighting. <\/p>  <p>  Under S.I. No. 243 of 2012 (ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS REGULATIONS) any person who is selling or letting a property must &ldquo;ensure that the energy performance indicator of the current BER certificate for the building is stated in any advertisements, where such advertisements are taken relating to the sale or letting of that building.&rdquo; The penalty for non-compliance with this regulation is a class A fine of up to &euro;5,000. <\/p>  <p>  There is currently no minimum BER rating that properties in the private rental sector must achieve. However, The Government's Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty 2016-2019, contains an action to examine the impact of\u00a0introducing\u00a0minimum thermal efficiency standards for\u00a0rental properties with a view to introducing such\u00a0standards post 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Previous research indicated that people living in rented accommodation are twice as likely to live in a home that is E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale, and\u00a0spend &euro;160-&euro;419 per annum more on energy than households in a home rated with a BER of B. However there is currently under-investment in improving the energy performance of rental properties. The typical residential tenancy in Ireland is short and hence tenants do not tend to invest significant sums in the property they are living in. At the same time, landlords under-invest in energy efficiency works as the tenants are the ones who benefit from the consequent energy bill savings and in a constrained rental market there appears to be little value placed on the energy efficiency of a rented property. These diverging incentives mean that energy efficiency investment is much lower in the private rented sector than among homeowners, even though Government grant schemes such as the Better Energy Homes scheme are open to landlords.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 my Department procured\u00a0external experts to examine the impact of introducing minimum energy efficiency standards for rented properties for the post\u00a02020\u00a0period. These\u00a0research findings are now being updated with new data from the 2016\u00a0census which showed an increase in the number of people renting accommodation across the State.

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries. The management\u00a0policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.    IFI is supported in its management role by Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee. IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles, harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.<\/p>  <p>  The conservation limit for any river is the number of adult spawning fish required to maintain a viable and sustainable salmon population. The river referred to is not open to harvest as it is not meeting its conservation limit but is above the threshold (50% of the limit) to justify catch and release angling.\u00a0 This permits people to engage in and enjoy angling activity while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks. <\/p>  <p>  There are 39 rivers nationally which have catch and release status in 2018. It is\u00a0considered\u00a0preferable, from an angling perspective, to have a river open on this basis as opposed to the river being closed to all angling.<\/p>  <p>  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling or commercial fisheries.<\/p>  <p>  IFI operates a confidential 24 hour hotline to which incidents of poaching and pollution and other activity can be reported.

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.    There are approximately\u00a017 premises in the townland of Beltichburne. Of these 3 (18%) are or will be served by commercial providers. The remaining 14\u00a0(82%) will be addressed through the National Broadband Plan State led Intervention.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and fully appreciate the frustration felt by people who do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.\u00a0 Delivering connectivity under the NBP\u00a0where commercial providers would not otherwise\u00a0act\u00a0remains a Government priority. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, there may be some connection options available to those in Beltichburne. According to my Department's technical team there is a mast located approximately 2.5 kilometres from Beltichburne. This mast is utilised by all retail\u00a0mobile operators. It has clear line of sight to Beltichburne and should be capable of providing a good quality signal level and download speeds to premises.\u00a0 Individuals can check with mobile operators on capability of providing 4G LTE services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that potential interim solution, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. <\/p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.\u00a0 These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact\u00a0in local authorities for their communities.\u00a0 The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring\u00a0a much greater degree of consistency\u00a0in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.\u00a0 There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800056#WRT05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":1281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800056#WRT05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1282,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[11565\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800056#WRT05400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the storage capacity in the State for gas, oil and electricity respectively; the way in which this compares with weekly demand; and his plans for increasing this capacity including agreed budgets and timelines.","asker":"1222","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1283,"content":"<p>The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) holds 90 days of emergency oil stocks, in accordance with International Energy Agency (IEA) rules and EU legislation, to be used in the event of a supply disruption.\u00a0\u00a0 68% of these stocks are held on the island of Ireland with 32% stored abroad. NORA continues to maximise the level of stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to storage availability and value for money considerations, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low-carbon Energy Future, 2015-2030&rdquo;.   For electricity, Ireland has a resilient diverse portfolio for power generation including traditional generation plants, renewable generation and electricity interconnection to allow for the import and export of electricity.\u00a0 Gas-fired generating stations are required to hold back-up secondary fuel supplies to cover 3-5 days in the event of a gas shortage. While technically electricity cannot be stored, two electricity generating plants in particular provide electricity security of supply &ndash;Turlough Hill and Moneypoint. <\/p>  <p>  Turlough Hill in Wicklow is Ireland&rsquo;s only pumped storage power station. It generates up to 292MW during peak demand periods and can go from standstill to full capacity in around 70 seconds by releasing water from the upper reservoir and allowing it to flow through four turbines into the lower reservoir. During periods of lower demand, water is pumped back to the upper reservoir, ready to be used again. This helps flatten the &lsquo;demand curve&rsquo; for electricity over any given 24-hour period and so is invaluable to the grid. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Moneypoint provides coal storage capacity on its site in Co Clare.\u00a0 The 900MW plant can hold three months of stocks, providing secure supply of electricity for this period. However, both the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper and the Programme for Government have committed to identifying a more sustainable replacement technology for Moneypoint before 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to gas, Ireland&rsquo;s energy security has been greatly enhanced by the addition of Corrib gas. Before this, over 90% of our gas was imported via the two interconnectors with Scotland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2006 Kinsale Energy&rsquo;s Southwest Kinsale Gas Field was converted to an offshore storage facility with a storage capacity of 230 million cubic meters.

The DART Expansion Programme comprises of the DART Underground Tunnel and a series of projects, including the City Centre Re-signalling project, interlinked with the Tunnel but which also have benefits in and of themselves as stand-alone projects.\u00a0 This series of projects will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all the lines linked and connected. This integrated network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch and Greystones.\u00a0 The route for the DART Underground Tunnel will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP also proposes to take forward a Metro Link scheme to run from Swords, via Dublin Airport to Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre (operating in tunnel under the city centre) and onwards to Sandyford using the existing Luas Green Line to ensure that growth along this corridor can be accommodated. This will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high-frequency cross-city rail corridor serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford. Metro Link will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, the NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades including those investment priorities identified in the NDP. In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NTA for further update.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the\u00a0eight Capital Plan regional and local road improvement projects mentioned by the Deputy is\u00a0the responsibility of\u00a0the relevant road authority with grant support from my Department.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As it will be some years before funding under the Capital Plan builds up to the level required to maintain the regional and local road network in a steady state condition,\u00a0expenditure continues to be primarily directed towards maintenance and renewal work. This means that the Capital Plan upgrade projects have to be implemented on\u00a0 a phased basis\u00a0as budgets allow and as\u00a0projects are advanced through the project development stages by the relevant road authorities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Two of the projects have reached construction stage -\u00a0the\u00a0Sallins Bypass and the upgrade of the Nangor and Adamstown roads in the vicinity of Grange Castle business park. The main design and construction elements of the Naas Bypass widening Scheme, Osberstown Interchange and Sallins Bypass Schemes\u00a0are being progressed under\u00a0one construction contract.\u00a0\u00a0Kildare County Council is the contracting authority and these three projects are expected to\u00a0be completed on a phased basis over 2019\/2020.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of the Nangor and Adamstown road upgrade, South Dublin County Council is the contracting authority and it is anticipated that the project will be completed in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The other projects will be progressed as the necessary development consents, land acquisition and procurement are advanced and as funding can be made\u00a0available\u00a0by my Department.\u00a0 As regards grant expenditure to date\u00a0for these projects, this information is included in the Regional and Local Roads Payment and Allocations Booklets which are available in the Oireachtas library.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the national road projects mentioned by the Deputy, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects\u00a0 is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0 Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.\u00a0 I have, therefore referred the Deputy's Question to TII for direct reply.

At the same time, Tusla has also established its own recruitment function, Tusla Recruit, to work on bespoke campaigns and to shorten recruitment timelines where possible.\u00a0 Tusla Recruit has taken a very proactive approach with its graduate recruitment campaign in recent years and plans for its 2018 campaign, such as early engagement with students and visits to campuses in Ireland and abroad are already well advanced.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also made a public commitment to putting in place measures to improve compliance with national standards in the area of child protection and welfare, and steps have already been taken to improve the systems used\u00a0in the service.\u00a0 In particular, the new national practice methodology called &ldquo;Signs of Safety&rdquo; is being introduced to improve the depth and quality of the screening and assessments of referrals.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Child Care Information System will be replacing the legacy ICT system and will be rolled out in the Carlow, Kilkenny and\u00a0South Tipperary area before the end of March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Relationships with the Garda&iacute; are being strengthened as a notification tracking system is in place and the Joint Working Protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla is being implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800058#WRV06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Resource Centres","counter":1440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800058#WRV06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1441,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[11466\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800058#WRV06900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding that was provided to each family resource centre in each year since 2008 in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1442,"content":"<p>The matter raised relates to operations funded by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding. The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy Lead Team has a specific sub-group to support implementation of the VFMPR recommendations. The single targeted youth funding programme is currently under development within my Department and is being informed by a number of ongoing activities. In 2017 my Department consulted with almost 600 stakeholders including young people, workers, managers\/ boards of management, ETBs and other departments and agencies funding services for young people at risk.  This was carried out at 16 different events across the country.  My Department also held specialist consultations with 13 different target groups of difficult to reach young people. In addition, a measurement advisory group has been established and the group is undertaking a number of research activities to inform a measurement system for the single scheme. An area profiling tool is also under development. <\/p>  <p>  To facilitate the review&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the future development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes, I have approved funding allocations for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017. These projects provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions while also operating as pilot programmes for new scheme development. Funding was allocated for the establishment of 5 new sample projects in 2016 and 10 in 2017. Funding has also been allocated to augment 7 existing projects in 2017. The initial five 2016 projects are now operational with those approved during 2017 in various stages of formation. The sample projects are located across the country and fall within 11 ETB areas.<\/p>  <p>  In implementing another of the review&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State. Data was collated in relation to project boundaries, locations of the project buildings and up-to-date contact details of youth services. Pobal, in association with Compass, compiled this data into an online map of youth services in Ireland. The map was publically released in October 2017 and is available on Pobal's website. This map was used in the 2017 sample process by my Department and the relevant Education and Training Boards as an indicator of population demographics and deprivation levels which could inform decisions in relation to funding allocations for specific areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800059#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800059#WRW01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1457,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[11697\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800059#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of staff assigned in her Department to the press office, public relations or communications roles in each year since 2015; the positions by staffing grade and designated role; when each new position came into existence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1458,"content":"<p>My Department does not have a designated Press Officer or stand-alone Press Office.<\/p><p>One of my appointed Special Advisors, Mr Jerry O'Connor, has special responsibility for communications.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017) and invalidity pension, which was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings. These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which was published on the 18th   October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers are now eligible to apply for invalidity pension since December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state. <\/p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.

Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period. Invalidity pensioners and Widows will continue to generally qualify for a full pension. <\/p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  <\/p>  <p>  The TCA model for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the design will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800060#WRX06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Working Family Payment Eligibility","counter":1568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800060#WRX06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1569,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[11088\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800060#WRX06200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 485 of 5 December 2017, the reason local authority representatives as office holders and not employees of local authorities are not entitled to family income support; her plans to address this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1570,"content":"<p>The Working Family Payment (WFP) is an in-work support that provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings.

I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first two months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 01 January 2018 - 28 February 2018<\/b><table><tr><th><div>-<\/div><\/th><th><div>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/div><\/th><th><div>Average processing <br \/><br \/>times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance<\/td><td><div>23.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>27.8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit<\/td><td><div>22.4<\/div><\/td><td><div>30.8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td><div>20.4<\/div><\/td><td><div>25.5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td><div>30.5<\/div><\/td><td><div>43.3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td><td><div>26.3<\/div><\/td><td><div>22.2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td><div>26.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>53.1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment<\/td><td><div>28.7<\/div><\/td><td><div>28.4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td><div>26.5<\/div><\/td><td><div>24.6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit<\/td><td><div>20.7<\/div><\/td><td><div>51.3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit<\/td><td><div>29.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td><td><div>30.5<\/div><\/td><td><div>34.9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td><div>38.9<\/div><\/td><td><div>50.7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)<\/td><td><div>31.9<\/div><\/td><td><div>45.2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td><td><div>39.4<\/div><\/td><td><div>44.0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)<\/td><td><div>36.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)<\/td><td><div>4.7<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td><td><div>30.4<\/div><\/td><td><div>37.4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)<\/td><td><div>24.6<\/div><\/td><td><div>32.6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back To Work Family Dividend<\/td><td><div>29.9<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional<\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>38.3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre-retirement Allowance<\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>29.9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td><div>22.7<\/div><\/td><td><div>26.0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance<\/td><td><div>23.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>25.5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td><div>34.2<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-Con)<\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>32.7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":1597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1598,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[11195\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the meetings she or her departmental officials have had with her British counterpart regarding Brexit and reciprocal rights; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1599,"content":"<p>My UK counterpart, Secretary of State Esther McVey, was recently appointed to her post in the Department for Work and Pensions.

Employment is central to independence and social integration and offers the best protection against poverty. This Government is committed to helping more people with disabilities to enter the workforce.  To this end recipients of disability allowance (DA) can retain a proportion of their income support payment as they move from welfare to work. <\/p>  <p>  DA is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability whose income falls below certain limits. To qualify for DA a person must, among other conditions, have an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year and as a result of this disability be substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of their age, experience and qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  The means disregard for DA is important in the context of ensuring that people with disabilities can participate in work while retaining a proportion of their social welfare payment. The current disregard provides that people with disabilities can earn up to &euro;120 per week from employment without their payment being affected while earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, some 10% of DA recipients avail of this provision.

In line with the recommendations of the Make Work Pay report published last April, the Government has dispensed with the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the DA earnings disregard.  This means that a report from a doctor is no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, procedures have been put in place with regard to fast-tracking the reinstatement of DA to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":1603,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1604,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[11212\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the considerable numbers of businesses and persons operating as fitters of new car parts, for example, exhaust engines or tyres that are not adequately trained or equipped to provide these services and the considerable consumer protection and road safety concerns that arise from this; and the steps she is considering to address this.","asker":"1228","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1605,"content":"<p>This matter is not proper to the Minister of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme","counter":1606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1607,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[11357\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons that have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's housing assistance payment scheme in 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1608,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[11358\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in receipt of rent supplement in County Cork by each local electoral area in tabular form at 31 December 2017 and to date in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1609,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 578 and 579 together.<\/p><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting some 32,450 recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;180 million for 2018.

If everyone was paid the same amount or more under the new total contributions approach system as they would have got under the old one, there would be little point in such a reform, and it would add to the sustainability challenges already faced by the State pension system.  Trends show that these sustainability challenges are going to place ever-increasing burdens in the coming years on workers who fund State pensions through the PRSI system.  The proposed new TCA system strikes a balance between recognising periods outside the paid workforce while emphasising the need to maximise the paid element in the contribution conditions for pensions.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund has been used to explore the costs of various options and to inform the design of the TCA.  The TCA model for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the design will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process.  <\/p>  <p>  The interim TCA model being made available for post-2012 pensioners (up to 2019) is based on 40 years, but has very significant Home-caring provisions, much more beneficial than those in the 2010 proposals, that make it more beneficial for homemakers disadvantaged by the Yearly Average approach.  This is because the 2010 model produces significantly worse outcomes for women, particularly where they have homemaking periods prior to 1994.<\/p>  <p>  To take one example, a pensioner born in 1950 who reached pension age in 2016, who had 18 years PRSI contributions, a gap of 18 years raising her children when aged 24 to 42, and a yearly average of 15-19.  Under the pre-2012 Yearly Average system, she might have expected a contributory pension at 75% of the maximum rate.  Under the Post-2012 Yearly Average system, her entitlement would be 65%.  Under the proposals announced earlier this year, she will qualify for a 90% pension.  However, under the 2010 proposals, which had a 30 year base for a maximum pension, but which did not recognise home-making pre-1994, her entitlement would only be 60%.  In taking a 40 year approach for this model, I have been able to have much more generous homecaring provisions, which largely benefit women who were disadvantaged by the previous system.  It will still remain possible for others to qualify for a full rate contributory pension with 30 years of paid PRSI and 10 years of credits (e.g. from jobseeking periods), over the course of a 50 year period.  Invalidity pensioners and Widows will continue to generally qualify for a full rate pension.  Those who do not qualify for a full rate SPC on this basis will still be able to make a claim to the means-tested SPNC, which pays up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, for those retiring after 2020,  the balance between the number of years required for a full pension and the level of recognition for homecaring periods will be decided after the consultation later this year, as will any transitional elements to the final proposal.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":1615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1616,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[11398\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800061#WRY03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a claim for jobseeker's allowance application by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1248","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1617,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance since August 2011.

People who have to take time out of the workforce to take up caring duties will be eligible to accumulate up to 20 years credits towards meeting the full 40 year contribution record.

However, I can say that I am in favour of financially incentivising retirement savings to help address a situation where the proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover is far too low at just 35% of the private sector workforce.  This suggests that a high percentage of the working population is not saving enough, or is not saving at all, for retirement.  <\/p>  <p>  Tax relief is a significant cost to the State but the benefits of tax relief are not at all well understood and many have little or no understanding of how the tax system impacts pension contributions.   This is why in launching the new Automatic Enrolment system detailed in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform, to incentivise participation and mitigate the risk of member opt-out, the Government believes that any financial incentives must be effectively communicated, easily understood and appreciated.  <\/p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for the success of the automatic enrolment system, any State provided financial incentives should strive to give relief in a manner that supports low to middle income earners and be sufficiently attractive to encourage such earners to participate.  Incentives should also avoid complexity and be as transparent as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Roadmap commits to a review of the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer.

Accordingly The Roadmap for Pensions Reform details a range of measures intended to support a positive ageing environment, where older people are, to the greatest extent possible, encouraged, and facilitated in working, if they wish to, beyond the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a default age at which employees must retire and the setting of retirement age remains a matter for agreement between employers\/employees and the employment contract.  The Government recognises that measures which may support longer working include encouraging employers to more closely consider the logic of, and justification for, mandatory retirement ages in employment contracts. <\/p>  <p>  Employers\/employees and their representatives had indicated difficulty in interpreting and engaging on matters relating to retirement age in the absence of an overarching guidance or framework.  In response to these concerns, the Workplace Relations Commission has recently published a &lsquo;Code of Practice on Longer Working&rsquo;.  The code informs best practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.  Following publication of this code, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will prepare and publish further guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age. <\/p>  <p>  The Government expects that these and other provisions will combine to result in greater employee flexibility to work beyond what may be considered the traditional retirement age of 65.  To ensure this is the case, the Roadmap confirms that employment practices in this area will be kept under close review in the near term.  This will include engaging with employer and employee representatives and monitoring the labour market more generally to observe changing employment practices. <\/p>  <p>  As the Roadmap makes clear, should it appear that these provisions are not resulting in improved flexibility for workers, the Government will examine and consider the merits of restricting the capacity to use mandatory retirement provisions relative to the State pension age.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1695,"content":"<p>Question No. 613 answered with Question No. 550.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":1696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1697,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[11682\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when the report on the costings of pay equality and the timeframe to achieve same (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1698,"content":"<p>As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection I have responsibility for State pension policy.

My Department\u00a0proposes to implement a legislative ban on the sale or manufacture of personal care products, detergents and scouring agents containing plastic microbeads and it is intended that Heads of a Bill to ban plastic microbeads will be published\u00a0later\u00a0this year. <\/p>  <p>  Over recent years, scientists, experts and policy makers have become increasingly concerned about the levels of waste, or marine litter, winding up in our seas and oceans.\u00a0\u00a0It can be found in every aspect of the marine environment and ranges in size from large objects, such as fishing nets or shipping containers, to micro- and nano-litter particles - i.e. particles of smaller than 5 mm in diameter and smaller than 0.05 mm, respectively. It is clear that this is an issue that needs to be addressed, at the very least, under the precautionary principle. \u00a0Marine litter also causes socio-economic harm, such as affecting tourism and consumer confidence in seafood.<\/p>  <p>  Plastic is a particular problem for the marine environment.\u00a0 Due to its buoyancy, it can easily be washed down rivers, blown offshore or collected by the tide from the shore as well as being dumped or lost directly into the seas from ships and fishing boats.\u00a0 It does not biodegrade and persists in the environment for a very long time.\u00a0 It can breakdown into secondary microplastic particles through erosion and there is evidence that both large plastic items and microplastics are being ingested by marine fauna with undetermined consequences both for them and for\u00a0those higher up the food chain who eat them, in turn. Plastics may\u00a0contain toxic additives\u00a0or may even\u00a0absorb other toxins present in the water.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While it is considered that most marine microplastic litter is created through the erosion of larger pieces, microplastics are also entering the marine environment in other forms such as micro-fibres from artificial fabrics worn off clothes by washing, for example. However, a certain amount of marine microplastic litter is caused by plastic microbeads which are used in cosmetics, body care and cleansing products, and detergents and surface cleaning agents, entering the marine environment via wastewater discharges into rivers and estuaries. <\/p>  <p>  While these microbeads only represent a small fraction of the microplastic litter entering the marine environment, they are a particularly pernicious product as they are &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; microplastics and cannot be removed once they reach it.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Microbeads could not be regarded as a major human necessity. They are often present merely for decorative purposes or are used as bulking agents in products. Also, where microbeads are used as exfoliating or scouring agents, a wide array of established safe and biodegradable organic particles or natural mineral alternatives is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":1713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1714,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[10827\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030800062#WRZ06500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to expand the parameters of the rebuilding home loan scheme to allow persons who have lost a house during the recession or have entered and exited bankruptcy to apply for the loan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1715,"content":"<p>Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced on 1 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must be of good credit standing and have a satisfactory credit record.

statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.\u00a0 The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters.\u00a0 The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme, providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The making of such a scheme is subject to\u00a0the consent\u00a0of the\u00a0Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property.<\/p>  <p>  Some local authorities have introduced locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property. \u00a0Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.\u00a0 Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.\u00a0 However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.\u00a0 Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.\u00a0 My Department has developed\u00a0legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.\u00a0 Among the measures\u00a0included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support\u00a0the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government last year approved the drafting of a Rates Bill.

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector. My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments. The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.

A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice. This is distinct from RAS, which is a different type of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Unlike HAP, where a RAS tenancy is ending, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for that household.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, which provides for HAP, a household in receipt of another form of social housing support, such as accommodation provided under the RAS, will not generally be eligible for HAP.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.
