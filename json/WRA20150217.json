Almost half of this trade is subject to the ban.  Across the EU, fruit and vegetables and dairy are the sectors most affected, although the loss of such a significant commercial market has had repercussions for the entire EU agriculture sector.  The most immediate effects of the ban have been felt by the Baltic Member States and Finland.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, the sectors most affected are dairy and pig-meat.  As regards milk, the continuing volatility in the global dairy market was already having a significant impact on dairy farmers in Ireland and this has been exacerbated by the Russian action.  There are, however, signs of improving sentiment in the dairy market and that global prices will recover as the year progresses.  As to pig-meat, there has been a substantial fall in producer prices, although this reduction comes after a three year high that peaked in the summer of 2014.<br\/><br\/>The EU Commission has taken a number of measures to support the market, valued at some &euro;350 million to date.  These include:<br\/><br\/>- Support for market withdrawals, green harvesting and compensation for non-harvesting for perishable fruit and vegetables;<br\/><br\/>- Introduction of private storage aid for butter and skimmed milk powder, recently extended to the end of September 2015;<br\/><br\/>- Opening of intervention buying-in for butter and skimmed milk powder, where the closing date was extended to December 31<sup>st<\/sup>in 2014 and the commencement date advanced to January 1stin 2015.<br\/><br\/>- Introduction of private storage aid for cheese for a short period in September to October 2014.  The scheme for cheese was discontinued as the uptake was not in the main from Russian ban affected countries.<br\/><br\/>- Introduction of a direct compensation package to farmers in the Baltic Member States and Finland.<br\/><br\/>I have maintained pressure on the EU Commission to ensure close monitoring of the situation and use all of the market tools available to alleviate the impacts.  The availability of private storage aid for butter and skimmed milk powder until the end of September next is welcome but I would like the Commission to consider the reintroduction of private storage aid for cheese and for pig-meat.  Depending on price developments in the sector, I also think that we may need to look seriously at intervention buying-in in the dairy sector, to be undertaken at price levels that would positively support the market. <br\/><br\/>At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.  Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, and have some flexibility, based on agreements secured at EU level, in relation to the phasing of super levy bills to farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Establishment","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[6625\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to alow all eligible applicants into the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme on a first-come, first-in basis in 2015, in view of the delay in commencing the scheme; if he will ensure that farmers will receive a significant payment under the scheme this year and all the funds provided under the scheme in the Estimates are paid out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>GLAS (the Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) is part of a suite of proposed measures under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP).

I strongly believe that progress to date can only be viewed as very positive, with the added bonus of a huge latent potential remaining to be developed on an ongoing basis, as we increase production following quota abolition.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Agriculture, I have headed two trade missions to China, with dairy market development a significant feature in both. Ireland's dairy offering resonates with Chinese consumers who place safety, traceability and sustainability at the core of their value proposition.  Uniquely amongst EU Member States, Irish dairy plants received a 100% approval rating during a Chinese Inspection visit in 2014.  As part of my last mission I hosted a highly successful dairy seminar attended by key Chinese buyers and media. <\/p>  <p>  Australia and New Zealand are traditional suppliers of dairy products to the Chinese market and have entered into bilateral agreements with China that involve commitments to remove tariffs within specific timeframes, depending on the product sector or subsector.  Additionally, both countries are members of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a group of countries that includes both China and the United States, who are in the process of negotiating a pluri-lateral free trade agreement.  Clearly the outcome of the TPP agreement will set the benchmark for future negotiations between the EU and China on market access for dairy products.   <\/p>  <p>  The Irish dairy sector would benefit greatly from such an arrangement.  However, negotiations on Free Trade Agreements come within the remit of EU Commission, based on a mandate from the EU Council of Ministers.  It is not within the gift of any individual EU Member State to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with China.   <\/p>  <p>  Negotiations for an update of the 1985 Trade and Economic Cooperation agreement between China and the EU were launched in 2007.  However these negotiations stalled in 2011 due to divergences between the mandates and expectations of both sides.  Essentially, Member States normally pressing for trade liberalisation, found themselves on the defensive regarding the access sought by China to the EU market, particularly for the automotive and electronic sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Instead, the decision was taken to focus initially on investment and in late 2013 the Council authorised the EU Commission to initiate negotiations for a comprehensive EU-China investment agreement.  It is unlikely that any serious progress can be made on an updated Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement until the investment agreement is finalised.   <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Irish Dairy sector has made extraordinary strides in China in recent years.  While a large proportion of dairy trade into China from countries such as New Zealand can be categorised as bulk commodity, for instance whole and skimmed milk powders, Ireland has an evolving focus towards, and competes at, the higher value end of the Chinese dairy market.  In the infant formula sector, Irish based products are viewed as super-premium brands.  China is now Ireland's second largest export market for dairy produce, compared to 13th in 2008.  In total, companies based in Ireland exported almost &euro;400m worth of dairy produce to China in 2014.  This is an increase from just &euro;104m in 2010 and highlights the huge rate of growth in our dairy exports there in a short space of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[6619\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will publish his Department's internal report into the special investigations unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a report arising from a review that I asked to be carried out following a Circuit Court case in November 2013, where the Judge directed that a defendant be found not guilty by direction of the court.

This EU measure recognises the importance of ensuring that sufficient numbers can derive a worthwhile livelihood from farming, which in turn helps to ensure food security as well as contributing to the overall Irish and EU economies.  There are basic obligations attached to the receipt of the Single Payment and in order to ensure the required levels of compliance, checks are carried out based on risk.  There is a Division within my Department tasked with the administration of the EU Single Payment scheme.  This scheme involves an annual payment made to farmers subject to compliance with certain conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Under cross compliance requirements, a farmer receiving direct payments is required to respect the various statutory obligations set down in EU legislation on animal identification, food safety, animal health and welfare.  Non-compliances in these areas, detected by any authorised officers controlling these areas are cross-reported by these officers to the Division dealing with Single Payment.  In all cases, decisions regarding whether a penalty is to be applied, and the extent of any such penalty, is purely a matter for the Division dealing with the Single Payment Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Staff from my Investigations Division, like those in all other Divisions who come across non-compliances during the course of inspections or investigations, are obliged to cross-report non-compliance to the Division who have responsibility for the Single Payments.

Rigorous checks are carried out by staff from my Department to ensure that the required standards are being observed.  When non-compliance is detected, a graded system of penalties may be applied based on extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance.  Furthermore, applicants who receive a penalty under the scheme have the right to appeal the decision to the independent Agricultural Appeals Office.  This provides comfort to applicants that in the event of a penalty being applied, the applicant can have the matter re-examined by someone who had no involvement in the earlier determination.  The success of the Single Payment Scheme relies on a balance between the provision of adequate information to applicants facilitating compliance on the one hand, and the performance of a fair and reasonable inspection regime verifying compliance on the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Safety Scheme","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[6627\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700053#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there will be a new farm safety scheme in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>Farm Safety is a critical issue facing farming today and is something that I am seriously concerned about.

In addition, my Department attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 16 October 2014, at which the report was examined.<\/p>  <p>  My Department took responsibility for a number of marine functions, including the fishery harbour centres, on 19 October 2007.  Since 2007, and prior to the production of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, a number of reports have been produced by management in the relevant division of my Department and by my Department's internal audit unit, which precipitated a very significant programme of change that has been implemented in the fishery harbour centres in the intervening years.  The sea fisheries administration division, based in Clonakilty, was reconfigured into four specialist units to target the specific areas of debt management, property management, operational management and capital development programmes.  <\/p>  <p> Specific measures pursued by the property unit included the establishment of a detailed database of the property portfolio, the appointment, following tender, of an outsourced property valuation service to carry out legally required rent reviews and new valuations together with the establishment of a dedicated legal resource within the Office of the Chief State Solicitor working exclusively on property issues in the harbours.   <\/p>  <p>  On the financial management front, a new rates and charges order was introduced in 2012.  The new order modernised the charging regime in the harbours and addressed some anomalies.  <\/p>  <p>My Department resourced the dedicated debt recovery unit to address the increasing debt profile that had developed in the harbours.  Income generated in the harbours increased by in excess of &euro;1.2 million in 2013 compared with 2007, an increase of 30%.  Importantly, the age profile of debt now suggests, in general, a preponderance of late payers rather than non-payers.  <\/p>  <p>  New systems and procedures were implemented to strengthen the cross-checking of invoicing for services in the harbours.

This definition of young farmer was agreed by EU Council and Parliament as part of the CAP reform agreement of June 2013.<\/p>  <p>  While the Regulation provides that young farmers and new entrants are priority categories under the National Reserve, it also provides scope to include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a 'Specific Disadvantage'. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that there is a group of young farmers who established their holding in 2008 and 2009, who comply with the definition of Young Farmer, but who missed out on both the Young Farmer Installation Scheme which closed to applications in 2008 and the Young Farmer priority category under the National Reserve which includes young farmers who commenced since 2010.   <\/p>  <p>  I asked my officials to travel to Brussels to engage with the EU Commission to see whether the category of farmers who commenced farming in 2008 or 2009 could be categorised as a group who suffer from a 'specific disadvantage', and whether it would be possible to facilitate application to the National Reserve for such young farmers, under the same conditions that apply to all other qualifying 'young farmers'.   <\/p>  <p>  As a result of my direction and with the recent agreement of the Commission, I am glad to say that this category can be considered as a 'group suffering from specific disadvantage'.  The positive result of this development is that these young farmers will be eligible to apply under the 2nd phase of the National Reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements. <\/p>  <p>  Applications will be made available in early April 2015.

BIM has recently assisted clients in the production of two separate and independent feasibility studies investigating the commercial and technical viability of establishing land based saltwater salmon production.

It was considered that it was not desirable to reclassify approximately 90,000 directors from class S to class A as the change would impose a major additional cost on small and medium sized businesses in the depth of a recession and would be counter to Government policy.<br\/><br\/>It was decided therefore to legislate to provide for a legal basis for determining that working directors with a shareholding of 50% or greater would be insurable at Class S.  Section 16 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 (No. 20 of 2013)<i><\/i>provides that the employment of a working director with a shareholding of 50% or more in a company is an excepted employment.  In these circumstances the individual is classified as self-employed and is liable to pay PRSI at class S.  These working directors are not regarded as being insurable as an employed contributor in the company.<br\/><br\/>This legislation came into effect from 28 June 2013.<br\/><br\/>The insurable status of working directors who own or control less than 50% of the shareholding of the company continues to be determined on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the Code of Practice for Determining the Employment or Self-employment Status of Individuals.<br\/><br\/>Annually, only about 450 (0.5%) of the total number of working directors (90,000 approximately) seek insurability decisions from my Department.  The vast majority of working directors consider themselves to be class S (self-employed) rather than class A (employee).<br\/><br\/>Information on the amount of PRSI that has been paid by employers for proprietary (working) company directors in each of the past ten years is not available and it is not possible to state what extra revenue would accrue to the State if working directors were categorised as class A for PRSI purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700054#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700054#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[7079\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700054#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for non-payment of moneys to a bus operator (details supplied) who was recently admitted to the free travel scheme for bus service here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>Travel operators must comply with a number of terms and conditions when entering the free travel scheme.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. <br\/><br\/>Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011, and under the 25% threshold which formed the basis for funding of Youth Guarantee measures under the Youth Employment Initiative. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<br\/><br\/>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. As set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan the Government intends to deliver on this objective by changing its activation process to ensure that young people benefit from earlier and more frequent engagement with case officers, by earmarking places on existing employment and training programmes for young people and by introducing some new programmes such as FirstSteps and JobPlus Youth. FirstSteps aims to offer young people you are particularly distant from the labour market a work experience opportunity with sponsor employers. In line with the Youth Guarantee commitment JobsPlus Youth offers employers who recruit a young person under 25 years of age who was unemployed for four months or more a subsidy of up to &euro;416 per month. The duration unemployed threshold for other age cohorts is 12 months. <br\/><br\/>The T&aacute;naiste launched FirstSteps and JobsPlus Youth on 4th February and the new process for engaging with young people in Intreo centres is currently being deployed; earmarked places on schemes such as Momentum were implemented in 2014 and the number of young people who accessed these places, including the reserved places is set out in the Table 1.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1 Youth Guarantee Progress to date*<\/b><table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Expected full-year intake<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015 YTD<\/th><th>Note<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach\/CTC<\/td><td>3,300<\/td><td>3553<\/td><td><\/td><td>CTC starters  end Dec -- including Youthreach 1800 persons<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including developmental internship)<\/td><td>5,000<\/td><td>3138<\/td><td>191<\/td><td>As of end January 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td>1,000<\/td><td>1410<\/td><td><\/td><td>As of  30th November 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus<\/td><td>1,500<\/td><td>410<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>As of  end Jan 15- U25 estimated as 14.7% of total starters in 2015 (127)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td>2,000<\/td><td>631<\/td><td>132<\/td><td>As of 5th Feb 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)<\/td><td>3,300<\/td><td>2319<\/td><td><\/td><td>As of 14th October <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTWEA<\/td><td>200<\/td><td>139<\/td><td><\/td><td>Including 5 persons on STEA<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VTOS<\/td><td>500<\/td><td>672<\/td><td><\/td><td>Estimated U25 unemployed entrants <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FAS\/Solas<\/td><td>9,500<\/td><td>8027<\/td><td><\/td><td>Based on SST, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; LTI starters YTD (end December)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship <\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Not yet commenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training and Mentoring supports<\/td><td>700<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB\/MFI micro-loans for young people<\/td><td>150<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td>23rd Dec 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training<\/td><td>250<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Not yet commenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gateway<\/td><td>450<\/td><td>192<\/td><td><\/td><td>30th November 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment<\/td><td>500<\/td><td>600<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>End January 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>28,350<\/td><td>21,101<\/td><td>387<\/td><td>*Excluding where figures are not available<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).

This is delivering real and tangible savings. <\/p>  <p>  These savings can be broken down into two elements, cash savings and a reduction in our\u00a0borrowing requirement over a period of time.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).\u00a0 It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in interest rates on our EU and bilateral programme loans in 2011, and more recently the early repayment of the IMF loans, mean that we have negotiated real cash savings to the exchequer of circa &euro;10 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to 12.5 and 15 years respectively.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.\u00a0\u00a0 This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. The restructuring of the IBRC promissory note has reduced the overall borrowing requirement for the State by &euro;20 billion over the next ten years. Under the previous arrangements, the State was required to borrow &euro;3.1 billion annually in order to meet the required cash payments on IBRC's Promissory Notes. As part of the arrangement the Central Bank acquired &euro;25bn of Floating Rate Bonds and &euro;3.46bn of 5.4% Treasury Bond maturing in 2025 in replacement of the Promissory Notes. Following this exchange the State no longer has to borrow to fund these annual cash payments in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  The extension of maturities and the promissory note arrangement reduces the State's borrowing requirement by over &euro;40 billion over the next decade, thus significantly improving the viability of the State's finances.<\/p>  <p>  These measures, and the interest rate reductions, have significantly improved the sustainability of our debt. The success of these efforts is\u00a0apparent in the strongly improving economy and the record\u00a0low bond yields\u00a0currently being offered for Irish Government debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates Eligibility","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[7007\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to modify the requirements for the primary medical certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, repayment of excise duty on fuel, and an exemption from Motor Tax. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme, an applicant must have a permanent and severe physical disability within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. 353 of 1994)\u00a0and satisfy one of the six qualifying criteria outlined in the Regulations.

The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations is being enforced by local authorities. A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal. This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards. Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but\u00a0I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012\/2013 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels, i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. In this regard solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed. <\/p>  <p>  The provisional carbon tax receipts for 2014 are &euro;385.2m. <\/p>  <p>  Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels this Government has also provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland,\u00a0generous grants via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependance on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.\u00a0 In 2014 the Better Energy programme provided &euro;53m grant support towards &euro;118m energy upgrade works.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly I do not intend to review the rate of carbon tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[6688\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on cases of tax evasion, in particular, those cases involving persons who had accounts in the HSBC Bank in Switzerland, and who had circumvented tax laws here by not declaring these accounts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[7027\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the amount recovered by the offshore assets group in the Revenue Commissioners in each year since it was set up in 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[7028\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the offshore assets group in the Revenue Commissioners is conducting a special investigation into the activities of a bank (details supplied), in respect of an outstanding tax matter for its Irish resident clients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[7029\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700057#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if any criminal prosecutions have occurred in respect of tax evasion by Irish resident clients of a bank (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 228 to 230, inclusive, together.<br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that\u00a0 the issue of offshore accounts held with the HSBC Bank has its origin in information on account holders in Switzerland\u00a0 which came into the possession of the French authorities in December 2009. <br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners wrote to the relevant French fiscal authorities in March 2010, when they became aware that the French Government may have obtained information in relation to bank accounts held with HSBC Bank in Geneva.

It is still a matter for the Departments concerned to advance any public projects on the list\u00a0or other projects in accordance with the Capital programme and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As you may be aware the Commission's EFSI proposal is to mobilise &euro;315 billion of investment, mostly from the private sector, over the\u00a0next\u00a03 years.  Under the EFSI proposal\u00a0investments will be made\u00a0in projects in order to receive a commercial return and funds will not be made available as grants.  The EFSI is expected to become operational later this year and subject to EFSI's project selection criteria some of the projects on the Irish list or others could be eligible for EFSI investment.  EFSI investments are to be consistent with Union policies and to support any of the following general objectives:-<\/p>  <p> - development of infrastructure, including in the areas of transport, particularly in industrial centres; energy, in particular energy interconnections; and digital infrastructure;<\/p>  <p> - investment in education and training, health, research and development, information and communications technology and innovation;<\/p>  <p> - expansion of renewable energy and energy and resource efficiency;<\/p>  <p> - infrastructure projects in the environmental, natural resources, urban development and social fields;<\/p>  <p> - providing\u00a0financing for SMEs and Midcaps, including working capital financing and risk bearing capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[7606\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected cost to his Department to convert to using Eircode; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>The Office of the Paymaster General in my Department makes occupational pension payments on behalf of the Superannuation Vote and a number of other public sector entities.

Prior to the State entering into any international legal agreement, the relevant Departments give careful consideration to the domestic implications of becoming a party to such an agreement.  Consideration is given to whether or not it is compatible with the Constitution to become a party to any particular agreement,\u00a0whether there is a need to amend domestic legislation or to put in place any administrative arrangements in order to facilitate the State complying with any such agreement, and the nature of any cost or financial implications that may arise for the State from becoming a party to any such agreement.  This process involves consultation among all relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General and is co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Any decision for the State to become a party to any international agreement is then a matter for the Government and it is advised of all the aforementioned matters prior to making a decision.  Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of each Minister and their Departments to manage expenditure within their agreed allocations and in this context it is a matter for individual Departments to ensure that spending is allocated to programmes and policy areas to meet any contractual and legal obligations as appropriate.

In this regard at tender stage applicants must sign a declaration in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing, their payment of taxes and social contributions; and a statement that none of the circumstances for exclusion apply.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in public procurement regulations and directives.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.<\/p>  <p>  In order to be considered for the award of contracts, applicants must pre-qualify by meeting criteria which are designed to assess their competence and capacity to perform the contract.  Those who do not meet minimum criteria are excluded from further participation in a tender competition.  When invoking the grounds for exclusion it is important that a contracting authority has evidence of a sufficiently robust nature to withstand any challenge to that decision.  For example in the case of non-payment which is the result of insolvency of a contractor then the insolvent entity may be excluded on the basis of their insolvency.  If the issue is one of a refusal to pay and solvency is not in question then, in the absence of a binding decision or a court judgement regarding that non-payment, the contracting authority is not in a position to exclude since there may be a valid reason for the non-payment.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Government approved the delegation of responsibility for implementation of the Construction Contracts Act 2013 to the Minister of State for Business and Employment at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mr Gerald Nash T.D., in November 2014.

The legislation when implemented will provide new minimum contractual provisions concerning payment arrangements between the parties to a construction contract.  Where payment disputes do arise between the parties to a construction contract, either party will have the right to refer the payment dispute to adjudication.  I understand that work is continuing on the preparations for the full implementation of the Act and a specific date for its implementation will be announced in advance once the necessary arrangements have been finalised, in order to provide sufficient notice to those affected by the Act's provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[7097\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700059#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide details of national lottery grants that are administered by his Department or by other Government Departments or agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":288,"content":"<p>The surplus generated by the National Lottery for good causes is transferred annually to the Exchequer and is applied to part-fund the Exchequer allocations to a specified range of expenditure subheads across various Votes.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The amount transferred to the Exchequer from the National Lottery surplus, together with details of the total Exchequer allocations to the relevant Lottery supported subheads, is published each year in Appendix 1 of the annual Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV).

The Companies Act 2014 introduces a modern Company Law Code for Ireland and brings significant benefits to business.<br\/><br\/>The Company Law Review Group, in its 2007 report, recommended the regulation of the title &ldquo;accountant.  On foot of this recommendation, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (as it then was), considered the matter and in particular noted the views of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition Authority.  The Competition Authority took the view that there was no clear public interest case which would warrant the legal protection of the term accountant.  <br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the Review Group on Auditing, which reported in 2000 also concluded that there was no compelling case for recommending statutory protection for the term accountant.  <br\/><br\/>However, in light of concerns expressed by members of the professional accountancy bodies and Members of this House during the passage of the Companies Act 2014.

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  The 2015 Action Plan contains a suite of 380 actions to deliver an additional 40,000 jobs this year throughout the country.  Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms.  IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals.  It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  One of the factors that has made the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) strategy such a success has been the engagement with stakeholders from across the country in throughout its preparation.  Each year my Department actively seeks, receives and employs the input, support and partnership with business and others in developing and progressing the Plans.  The process for  APJ2015 was no different.<\/p>  <p>  My Department formally began the process of developing the APJ in July 2014. The Action Plan is informed by my Department's ongoing research, the work of the National Competitiveness Council, information from the Enterprise Development Agencies, feedback from the new Local Enterprise Office network in the regions, and general interaction of my Department with stakeholders from every county over the year.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also convened a number of Action Plan for Jobs business forums to consult directly with industry and other stakeholders. These forums have been convened around the country since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs process in 2012, including Co. Longford.<\/p>  <p>  I personally held meetings dedicated to APJ2015 with representatives from IBEC, American Chambers, SFA, Chambers Ireland, ISME, ICTU, SIPTU, IMPACT, UNITE and the INOU, seeking their views on the shape and content of the Plan.  I also held an APJ roundtable with entrepreneurs and small businesses.  In many cases these discussions were followed-up with formal written submissions.   <\/p>  <p>  A written request for submissions was also issued to stakeholders to accompany the open-call for submissions on my Department's website, which facilitates input from every region of Ireland into the process.  In all, 40 submissions containing over 500 actions were received from all quarters by the end-September deadline. These greatly informed the final APJ2015 strategy which was launched on January 29th last. <\/p>  <p>  That Action Plan for 2015 has a strong focus on regional development and earlier this month the Government launched a &euro;250 million plan to accelerate jobs growth in towns and villages across the country. Action Plan for Jobs - Regional is aimed at encouraging communities and agencies in each region to work together to support job-creation. The Regional Action Plans will be developed for regions, with Longford alongside Laois, Offaly, and Westmeath. As part of the development of the plans we will consult with businesses and representative groups and local authorities in Longford together with the Education and Training Boards and other relevant public and private sector bodies in the county. A Framework document (www.djei.ie\/trade\/competitiveness\/regionalenterprisestrategies.htm) has been published to explain the approach to be adopted. The first of these plans will be published in the coming weeks for the Midlands and the Action Plans for all other regions will be published or in development by July. The first Regional Action Plan will cover the Midlands and is currently being finalised by my Department.  Like the national Action Plan for Jobs process, a great deal of the value of the Plan will be in the contribution made by all stakeholders, with the sum of the parts making a greater impact than the individual elements could do on their own. The Action Plans will be flexible and dynamic to allow additional actions and ideas to be added as they emerge.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700060#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":318,"content":"<p>Question No. 253 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Expenditure","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700060#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[7609\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700060#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the projected cost to his Department to convert to using Eircode; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>My Department anticipates that Eircode postcodes can be incorporated into address records on Department stationery with minimal costs.

This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, as well as the country in which it was born and reared.<br\/><br\/>In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169\/2011, which has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas. In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time.  The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337\/2013, which introduces mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats from 1<sup>st<\/sup>April 2015.\u00a0 Under this regulation labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats.  The term 'Origin' can also be used where the country\/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.  A Statutory Instrument is being prepared by my Department to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement from 1<sup>st<\/sup>April 2015. Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules.<br\/><br\/>The FIC Regulation also refers to the more complex issues of origin labelling meat as an ingredient, and instances where the country of origin of a food is given and it is not the same as that of its primary ingredient. In the case of these provisions, the Commission was required to prepare reports on the impact of mandatory country of origin or place of provenance rules. In the case of the use of meat as an ingredient, the Commission may accompany these reports with legislative proposals.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the labelling of meat as an ingredient, the European Commission published a report in December 2013 which was subsequently discussed at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in March last year.  There were diverging views among Member States as to the introduction of mandatory provisions for meat as an ingredient, with a number of Member States calling for further analysis from the Commission.  The report has also been considered by the European Parliament which, only last week, passed a resolution calling for the Commission to come forward with legislative proposals.<br\/><br\/>During the discussions in Council, I expressed the opinion that given the complexity of the issue  I believed that further analysis is required before such measures can be finalised. Issues requiring further attention include the potential additional cost to consumers, the additional regulatory impact and cost on industry, the extent to which potentially detailed and complex origin labels that might result would add to clarity and transparency for consumers, and the potential impact on intra community trade. \u00a0I await the Commission's response to the discussions in the Council and in the European Parliament, which should provide the opportunity to address all these outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700062#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700062#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[6995\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700062#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive a payment under the single payment scheme for 2012 following recent contact by his Department officials to this person.","asker":"1074","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>An application under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 15 May 2012.

A number of assessments have been concluded to date in accordance with the regulations and Fisheries Natura Declarations have been introduced to manage certain sea-fisheries, taking account of the conclusions of these assessments.  I understand that the Marine Institute has conducted these assessments in accordance with best scientific practice and recommended methodologies where available.<br\/><br\/>In response to the ECJ judgment in case C-418\/04, multi-annual funding was made available by both my Department and the former Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to undertake data collection and baseline studies.  This work is now substantially complete and my Department continues to provide funding for, inter alia, assessments of the interactions of sea-fisheries and aquaculture with marine Natura 2000 sites. The allocation of other resources involved is an operational matter for the Marine Institute.  The Programme of Measures responding to case C-418\/04 sets out the actions taken to date by Ireland in response to the Judgment of the Court together with commitments for further action to ensure that remaining issues have been dealt with.  The preparation of the Programme and monitoring of its implementation is led by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<br\/><br\/>The majority of the marine Natura 2000 sites concerned are coastal and located within Ireland's 12 nautical mile limit.  I established the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF), built on a network of Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs), specifically to give inshore fishermen and their communities a voice in policy making and decisions on inshore fisheries management and to work with the Department and the marine agencies in developing robust, scientifically sound measures to support sustainable fisheries into the future.  The first meeting of the NIFF took place on 15 January and the delegates received a presentation from the Marine Institute on the processes involved in the preparation of the assessment reports.<br\/><br\/>In addition to those assessments already published, the Marine Institute has recently submitted an assessment of sea-fisheries in all marine Special Areas of Conservation on the south and west coasts which is currently under active consideration in my Department.  A prioritised approach is necessary to address an assessment of this scale and I am particularly conscious of the need for stakeholder engagement at all stages of this policy development in accordance with EU environmental legislation and the Common Fisheries Policy.  For this reason, my Department is working closely with the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and an Bord Iascaigh Mhara to prepare a draft prioritised approach which I look forward to publishing with the assessment report for public consultation and for discussion with the NIFF.<br\/><br\/>A number of the documents requested by the Deputy are publically available on websites including the Department's fishing portal website and the websites of other organisations.

As the Deputy will be aware, this Bill (the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014) is currently at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and I hope, with the co-operation of the Oireachtas, that the Bill will be enacted very promptly.

These payments are to be calculated net of other State benefits.

He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most a further inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to the increase experienced in the Dublin area through Operation Acer, which is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  This includes a particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  Burglary Response Units attached to each Division take the lead in Operation Acer and are assisted by other units as required.  In addition, a further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements and this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects which has resulted in the successful arrests of Acer targets.  These Operations are all coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.<\/p>  <p>  Since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am determined to tackle it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as the question of traceability of gold and jewellery purchases is concerned, I am committed to examining the best approach to regulation in the area of cash for gold business providers, having regard to the potentially significant impact on legitimate businesses. It is important to recognise that any legislation in this area would have a potentially significant impact on a broad range of businesses.  There are a large number of legitimate businesses such as jewellers, antique dealers etc., as well as 'cash for gold' outlets that would be impacted upon.  As the regulatory and resource burden of any proposed measure will have to be carefully examined to ensure that it is proportionate to the matter being addressed I have asked officials in my Department to carry out a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which will facilitate a process of consultation with groups likely to be affected.

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<br\/><br\/>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances e.g. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons; or where the application is made on behalf of the minor child of a naturalised Irish citizen.<br\/><br\/>When an applicant is issued a certificate of naturalisation, he or she can then make an application to the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for an Irish passport.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

In this regard, the accounts for 2012 and 2013 were recently published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available on the website of NMBI. <\/p>  <p>  The President of the NMBI has stated that NMBI is facing considerable costs arising from changes to the way the laws regulating the professions operate, and also from handling fitness to practice complaints. In addition to supporting the new public fitness to practise structures, he further stated the fee increase will foster excellence in the professions through a more effective Continuing Professional Development (CPD) framework, an enhanced scope of practice and the new Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for registered nurses and midwives recently published. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I met with the President, Vice-President and Chief Executive of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland on the 29 January 2015 to discuss the current dispute over the registration fee. I again requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency. I am aware that since that meeting the Board has engaged in discussions with the nursing unions with a view to finding a solution, possibly facilitated by a third party, on the means by which the board and staff associations might come to an agreement on the fee structure for the future. <\/p>  <p>  I again encourage the NMBI to find an outcome which secures the Board's minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a potential scenario where nurses and midwives maybe removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability. Taking nurses off the register in a few months' time would create huge problems for hospitals and community facilities which need nurses to function, and for nurses themselves who would not be able to work or get paid if they were not registered. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700068#WRQ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700068#WRQ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[6851\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700068#WRQ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to improve the dental services in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The Strategy is accompanied by a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  It includes the provision of intensive home care packages, an information campaign and resources for GPs, who are most often the first port of call for people worried about dementia.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy acknowledges that while current health and social policy is focussed on caring for people with dementia in their own homes, there will come a time for many when home care may no longer be feasible or appropriate and when long-term residential care will be the best option.  This can particularly arise when 24-hour care is needed or when the person with dementia is living alone.  There is clearly a case for dementia-specific facilities as dementia is sometimes accompanied by behavioural and psychological symptoms such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, wandering and sleep disturbance and these can occur at any stage of the illness.  These behaviours can pose significant challenges for staff and other patients and can be dangerous and distressing for the person with dementia, and a specialist facility is sometimes necessary. <\/p>  <p>  One of the Terms of Reference for the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is to examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices.

The upsurge in violence and the increasing number of casualties, in particular innocent civilians caught up in the fighting, has been deeply troubling.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached in Minsk on 12 February, following all-night talks involving Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko and President Putin. The package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict offers hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, which has claimed over 5,300 lives and forced almost a million people to flee their homes. The agreement provides for a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  It also provides a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, including those relating to elections, border control and prisoner exchange.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the ceasefire is respected and that the parties to the agreement take immediate, concrete steps to implement the provisions of the Minsk Agreement. It is deeds not words that will provide assurance that all sides are genuinely committed to ending the fighting and restoring peace in eastern Ukraine. <\/p>  <p>  At the informal European Council held on 12 February, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande briefed EU leaders on the outcome of the Minsk talks. President Poroshenko also addressed the meeting and provided a realistic assessment of what was agreed. Leaders assured President Poroshenko of the EU's full backing for his efforts to restore peace and to maintain Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also considered practical ways of supporting implementation of the agreement, including through further humanitarian assistance and strengthening of the OSCE Mission.<\/p>  <p>  Unity and consistency has characterised the EU's actions in response of the Ukrainian crisis to date. It is crucial that this unity is maintained as it is key to our influence and our effectiveness. <\/p>  <p>  We have consistently stated that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Ukraine.  The initiative undertaken by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande's was aimed at reviving the September Minsk Agreements and bringing an end to the current spiral of violence.

The Council considered how the EU can most effectively prevent and combat international terrorism, including by strengthening engagement with, and support for, third countries, in particular in the Middle East and North Africa. We also agreed to redouble our efforts to address underlying factors, in particular the on-going conflicts in Europe's southern neighbourhood. <\/p>  <p>  Libya and Yemen were also a focus of discussion at the Council, where the situation on the ground in both countries remains extremely volatile and is a cause of great concern, particularly from a humanitarian perspective.  <\/p>  <p>  I joined with my colleagues in welcoming the convening of UN brokered talks on Libya, and in encouraging all relevant actors to participate in a process that aims to bring an end to the current conflict. <\/p>  <p>  On Yemen, the Council also expressed deep concern for the intensifying humanitarian, economic and security crisis and reaffirmed our commitment to continue to support Yemen, its political transition, and to stand by the Yemeni people at this critical juncture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700072#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700072#WRU00450"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[7017\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700072#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 500 of 3 February 2015, if he will answer the question asked, which dealt with his responsibility with regard to the authorisation of the transit of foreign military personnel through Irish airspace or on civilian aircraft, in view of the fact that the transport of military personnel is not covered by the 1952 air navigation carriage of munitions of war, weapons and dangerous goods order.","asker":"1192","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>As I said in my reply to Question number 500, the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of foreign military aircraft in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to military personnel travelling on civil aircraft, my reply stated that legislation provides that the Minister for Transport has primary responsibility for the regulation of such aircraft.

The OECD average is 1:14 and the EU21 average is 1:16. This ratio, which was at the OECD average in 2008, has increased in recent years as a result of increasing student numbers and restrictions on staffing imposed under the Employment Control Framework. <br\/><br\/>  While the staff - student ratio is a widely used proxy for performance of higher education institutions and systems, it is important to note that it is only a proxy. It does not reflect class size, and it does not take account of student contact hours and wider engagement which makes international comparisons difficult.  However, the deterioration in the ratio and the resultant pressure this was placing on the higher education system was one of a number of factors which led to the establishment of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education. This Group is examining the long term funding sustainability of the sector and will report to me by the end of this year.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in relation to the Deputy's specific question, there isn't a linear correlation between the student - staff ratio and the level of funding in the sector.

Following public concern with regard to the widespread failure to comply with regulatory requirements in all sectors of the construction industry, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014) were introduced to strengthen the arrangements in place by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations.  Over 5,000 construction projects have commenced to date since the new regulations took effect on 1 March 2014 and thus require statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.   <\/p>  <p>  I intend to announce details of the imminent review of S.I. No. 9 of 2014 early next month.  A full report on the matter will be produced by the second quarter of 2015 and will inform further regulation in this critical area. I will arrange for a copy of the report to be made available in the Oireachtas Library in due course. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the additional costs for one-off housing units, I refer to the reply given in response to Questions Nos. 541 and 542 of 18 December 2014 which remains relevant.  Price is determined by market forces and is therefore outside of the scope of my regulatory powers.  Nevertheless, I recognise the importance of ensuring that the regulations do not impact unduly on one-off housing, particularly in relation to cost.  As indicated previously, my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, is currently finalising additional guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a typical one-off dwelling.  This guidance will be helpful in better informing the market in relation to offering realistic and appropriately priced professional services for such work.   <\/p>  <p>  Detailed submissions from both the Construction Industry Federation and the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland were among the 500 submissions from industry stakeholders and private individuals received by my Department during the consultative process which informed the development of S.I.

Subsequently, both organisations participated in various working groups convened by my Department and the Local Government Management Agency to facilitate and support the smooth transition by all stakeholders to the new regulatory framework.  Other organisations which participated included the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, Engineers Ireland, the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, the Housing Agency and Fire Officers and Building Control Officers from a range of local authorities.

LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The current Programme is being implemented on a transitional basis pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br\/><br\/>During 2010, a national model involving full integration of Community Development Projects (CDPs) with Local Development Companies (LDCs) was set out by the former Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs with a number of alternative delivery structures considered.  During this transition period in 2010 and 2011, the LCDP was delivered by a number of CDPs, and by all LDCs and Alternative Delivery Structures, details of which are set out in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  Some CDPs decided to opt out of the LCDP integration process and in such cases, my Department provided funding to help meet certain wind-up costs, where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>The LCDP funding allocations to the Local Development Companies for the period 2010 to 2014 are provided in Table 2.  The Alternative Delivery Structures continued to be paid directly by my Department from 2011 to 2014 (as set out in Table 3) and will be funded on an interim basis for Quarter 1 2015.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the estimated total of administrative costs of the LCDP per annum from 2010 to 2014 this averages between 31.7% for 2010, 31.3% for 2011, 29% for 2012, 28.16% for 2013 and 27.3% for 2014.<br\/><br\/>Administrative costs charged against the programme have historically been capped at 33% with the objective of reducing that figure to 25%.  With the new programme, SICAP, it was stated specifically in the Invitation to Tender document that the total administration costs must not exceed 25% of the total budget cost.<br\/><br\/>Table 1<table><tr><th>Community Development Project<\/th><th>County<\/th><th>2010 Funding<\/th><th>2011 Funding<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Open Door Community Dev.

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. <br\/><br\/>It is fully recognised that people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity over the last number of years.  The scale of the mortgage arrears problem amongst local authority borrowers necessitated the introduction of a Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme in February 2014 in line with the MTR Scheme in relation to mortgages from private institutions introduced nationally in June 2012.<br\/><br\/>The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community. Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.<br\/><br\/>LAMTR is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears. The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.

The vast majority of contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. However, this information is commercially sensitive to each operator and is not available to my Department. <br\/><br\/>In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households. Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.<br\/><br\/>Among the measures included in the Government&rsquo;s waste policy, <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland<\/i>, which was published in July 2012, was the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low- income households. <br\/><br\/>The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its second report to Government in July 2013. Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, including the fact that the vast majority of households have moved away from local authority collection and have engaged private waste collectors on whom it would be difficult to impose any obligation to provide a waiver system, mandated the working group to continue to examine the issue, with a view to submitting a third report to Government in due course.<br\/><br\/>Given that the vast majority of local authorities no longer collect waste and that the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged and services offered vary across the country, it is becoming increasingly apparent that introducing a national waiver scheme in the context of an open market for waste collection is highly complex. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700078#WRAA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Eligibility","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700079#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[7130\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021700079#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if a council can insist that a local authority tenant, of over 30 years standing, who has not yet commenced to purchase the family home, and who does not owe any rent whatsoever, must surrender the legal right to purchase this home, to the local authority, as a mandatory pre-condition to a housing adaptation grant being used by the local authority to deal with that person's disability needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>Under the Social Housing Investment Programme, my Department allocates funding to support local authorities in undertaking adaptations and extensions to their social housing stock, to meet the needs of tenants with a disability or to address serious overcrowding.

refers to General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund.  Through the Local Government Fund, my Department provides a funding contribution towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers.  Up to 2014 this funding mechanism took the form of the General Purpose Grant (GPG).<br\/><br\/>As a result of the establishment of Irish Water, the local government funding model changed considerably in 2014. Prior to 1 January 2014, funding for operational water expenditure in the main came from the Local Government Fund through GPG allocations.  The funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services is now governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities and, therefore, the authorities are no longer in receipt of funding for these water services costs directly from the Local Government Fund.

In this regard, my Department is concentrating its resources with control measures on land it owns or manages so as to protect the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species, including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns, from a range of different predators.

In order to facilitate engagement with local communities and people of all ages nationwide, I have met with the County and Cities Management Association (CCMA) and have requested each local authority Chief Executive Officer to lead the development of local-level plans for Ireland 2016 in their individual counties during 2015.  Dedicated Ireland 2016 co-ordinators and steering groups are being put in place in each local authority to help to shape and drive the relevant county programmes. A series of public meetings will be undertaken in each county, at which members of the public can come together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.  I have allocated funding of &euro;1 million to local authorities in 2015 to support this overall process.<br\/><br\/>In addition, since the launch of the Ireland 2016 initiative, I have convened two meetings of the All-Party Oireachtas Group on Commemorations, of which I am Chair.  The Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, which is chaired by Dr Maurice Manning, has also met on one occasion since that date.  The first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the 1916 Commemorations, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, took place on 3February 2015.  <br\/><br\/>Meetings have also taken place with the various key Departments, agencies, local authorities and other interested parties.  My Department's 2016 Project Office is engaging with the National Cultural Institutions, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse cultural programme is developed.  Meetings and a dedicated workshop have also been held with a wide range of Irish language groups in order to develop an Irish language programme.
