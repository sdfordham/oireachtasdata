","asker":"1198","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 58 together.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Governments and this one most notably, have consistently stated their commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government. The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  <\/p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.  I look forward to viewing the report from this Group.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers. <\/p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers.  I have asked the Department to review forms and update them to ensure that a more neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700063#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[24004\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700063#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the amount of payment received in the case of persons (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>The first person concerned is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at the weekly rate of &euro;296.80 and comprises:<table><tr><th>Personal rate<\/th><th>&euro;188.00<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Increase for Qualified Adult<\/td><td>&euro;124.80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sub Total<\/td><td>&euro;312.80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less Means<\/td><td>&euro; 16.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total weekly rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance<\/td><td>&euro;296.80<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The second person concerned is not in receipt of a social welfare payment in her own right as she is the qualified adult on the payment of the first person concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700063#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Payments","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700063#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[24008\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700063#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost associated with a &euro;10 increase in the State pension (contributory) and the State pension (non-contributory); and if she will make a statement on the matter.

There are approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.  In Dublin, there are currently over 25,300 landlords in respect of over 25,400 tenancies supported by a rent supplement payment. A detailed breakdown of rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure for 2014 and to date in 2015 is provided in the tabular statements.<\/p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. In response to these difficulties, the Department has put in place a number of preventative measures to ensure that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required. The Department&rsquo;s preventative policy allows for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits throughout the country, as appropriate. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy. This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through the payment of increased rent payments. The number of rent supplement recipients in Dublin who contacted the Department highlighting difficulties in securing properties is not maintained. However, a total of some 1,400 rent recipients in Dublin have been supported through increased rental payments.<\/p><p>A Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in conjunction with Threshold was introduced in the Dublin region and Cork city where supply is particularly acute. The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families and persons at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 2,100 households referred to above, almost 700 households in Dublin have been supported as a result of engagement under the Protocol and over 20 households in Cork City. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s response to the current housing difficulties, including any extension of the Protocol, remains under review at this time to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided. The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to ensure that persons in receipt of rent supplement worried about losing their home are provided with information on the supports available which includes issuing text messages to over 50,000 rent supplement recipients, issuing monthly tweets to Department followers, updating the website and the distribution of posters to Department Offices, Post Offices, Citizen Information Centres, MABs offices and Oireachtas members.<\/p><p>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. Nominated payments are made under the rent supplement scheme in some 20% of cases. <\/p><p>The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords, for the provision of short-term support. The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long-term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP). HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system and is currently being rolled out in selected local authority areas to over 2,200 households. Under HAP, the local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Expenditure<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th><div>Cost &euro;000<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td><div>338,3471<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td><div>107,2022<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>1. 2014 Revised Estimate<\/p><p>2.

The Group considered the means testing of child benefit would have considerable administrative consequences, as the scale of means testing would be greater than anything required by the current system.  Instead the Group recommended that child benefit should continue to be paid on a universal basis. <\/p><p>It is my intention to retain child benefit as a universal system to assist families with the cost of raising children.  A crucial element of a strong and sustainable welfare system is the principle that everybody contributes, and that the system is there in turn to support those contributors at key stages in their lives.  Child benefit is one of the few universal payments in the welfare system in that regard, and its universality has an important role to play in maintaining the sustainability of the system.<\/p><p>For that reason, child benefit was increased by &euro;5 a month, or &euro;60 per annum, from January 2015.  This recognises the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and the fact that families are continuing to face difficulties.  In the <i>Statement of Priorities<\/i>, the Government promised a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families, and this increase is in line with that commitment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Administration","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[24025\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an arrears payment under the JobBridge Scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>All arrears due were included in payments of 26<sup>th<\/sup>May 2015 and 16<sup>th<\/sup>June 2015 and the correct weekly rate now applies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[24035\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700064#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding pension schemes for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that Community Employment (CE) supervisors are the employees of private companies.

","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>The price differential of fuel purchased north and south of the border is driven by a number of variable factors, exchange rates, taxes, reliefs and differing compositions of the products.  The exchange rate between the Euro and Sterling at any given point in time has a significant impact on the end price of solid fuel in both jurisdictions.  Since mid 2013 the sterling euro exchange rate has changed by over 14% in favour of Sterling.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Taxes applied to solid fuels differ in both jurisdictions with different VAT rates in operation on both sides of the border, the VAT rate is 5% in the north and 13.5% in the south.  Since 2013\u00a0a carbon tax has been applied in Ireland while\u00a0the UK apply\u00a0a Climate Change Levy on non-domestic consumption of solid fuel.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the VAT rates, the UK can apply the 5% rate to coal and other fuels used for residential purposes on the basis that they had a zero VAT rate in place for those supplies on 1 January 1991.  This provision also allows Ireland to apply the zero VAT rate to certain foodstuffs, children's clothes and shoes, and certain medicines on the basis that the VAT rate in force on 1 January 1991 was zero.  However, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a zero rate or 5% rate to coal, as we did not apply a zero rate to coal on that date.  Nonetheless, as Ireland applied a reduced VAT rate to coal on 1 January 1991, this allows us to continue to apply a reduced rate to coal, but only where the rate is 12% or more. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  In this regard solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed. <\/p>  <p>  The application of carbon tax to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards, for sale on that market, may not be sold in the State.  Compliance with the Regulations is being enforced by local authorities.  A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the NSAI for the verification of sulphur content in coal.  This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards.  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.<\/p>  <p>  In the most recent cross border price comparison, which was carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in May 2015, petrol and diesel were significantly cheaper in the south whilst home heating oils were a fraction of a cent more expensive in the south.  Petrol was cheaper by 15 cent per litre and diesel was cheaper by 28 cent per litre in the south.  Kerosene was 0.16 cent more expensive per litre and home heating diesel was 0.02 cent more expensive per litre in the south.  Coal and peat are not among the products compared as part of this survey, however, this illustrates the price differentials that exist generally in fuel products.<\/p>  <p>  Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels this Government has also provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, generous grants via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.  In 2014 the Better Energy programme provided &euro;53m grant support towards &euro;118m energy upgrade works.<\/p>  <p>  These grants, together with the carbon tax, are key tools\u00a0to reduce emissions towards meeting our\u00a0climate change commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700065#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[24047\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied regarding the adequacy of the availability of working capital to the hotel and catering industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that small businesses, including those in\u00a0the hotel and catering industry, play a central role in\u00a0the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.

The relief applies to properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014. For the relief to apply, the property must be owned for a period of at least 7 years.

Where the house has been occupied by an individual for part of the period of ownership, only the portion of the gain that corresponds to the period of occupation is exempt. The rationale for the relief is to ensure that the sale of a house, which will generally be replaced with another house, can be done on a tax-neutral basis.\u00a0 <\/p><p><b>Farm restructuring relief<\/b><\/p><p>This relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2013.

A breakdown of this total by gift tax, inheritance tax, probate tax and discretionary trust tax is available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics website at . The most recent year for which this information is available is 2014 and updates will be published in due course. However, they are not in a position to provide the figure requested by Deputy Tuffy.\u00a0 The source of their information on the value of inherited property are the returns that persons, who are liable for the payment of capital acquisitions tax (CAT), are required to make when property is transferred under a deceased person's will or intestacy. These returns do not contain information in respect of all such properties. There are a number of reasons for this.<\/p><p>In common with most other taxes, CAT operates on a self-assessment basis. Several of the tax exemptions that are available are taken on a self-assessment basis and the person who inherits the property is not required to submit a return to Revenue.\u00a0 For example, information in respect of property transferring between spouses and civil partners, from deceased children to parents and to charitable bodies does not have to be submitted to Revenue as tax exemption is taken on a self-assessment basis. <\/p><p>The relationship between the deceased person and the person who inherits a property determines the maximum life-time aggregate tax-free threshold below which CAT is not charged. There are, in all, three separate relationship thresholds (set out below). The value of each of a person's inheritances since 5 December 1991 is aggregated and CAT is charged, where the aggregate value exceeds the relevant threshold, on any amount that exceeds the threshold. However, it is only where the value of property inherited by a beneficiary exceeds 80% of the relevant threshold (or the actual threshold) that a return has to be submitted to Revenue.<\/p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000 <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the deceased person. This threshold also applies to parents where they inherit an absolute interest in a property from a child. <\/p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor (for example, a grandparent) or lineal descendant of the deceased person.<\/p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 <\/b>applies in all other cases, for example, from uncle to niece, between in-laws and persons with no relationship to each other. <\/p><p>Apart from the absence of the information requested by the Deputy, other considerations are also relevant. CAT is not an 'estate' tax in the sense that it does not apply to the value of a deceased person's entire estate. Rather, it is a tax on the value of property inherited by an individual beneficiary. This means that a high value property, if inherited jointly by several beneficiaries, may be below the individual tax-exempt thresholds for those beneficiaries and, therefore, not liable for the payment of CAT.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Significant relief from the payment of CAT is available where farmland and other business property is inherited. Where certain conditions are met, for example, in relation to the use to which the farm\/property is put following the inheritance, the market value of the farm\/property may be reduced by 90% before CAT is charged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Staff","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[24064\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is aware of Allied Irish Banks' plans to outsource work and staff from its application and development management teams within the information technology division to third party providers; if he is confident that any such move would not pose a risk to key areas such as payment processing and online banking, as was demonstrated by failures in Ulster Bank; the assurances he will provide that jobs will be protected in the bank's plans to outsource this work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[24205\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700066#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the planned outsourcing of the application and development management section of the information technology department in Allied Irish Banks; his views regarding the outsourcing of a key sector of the Department that deals with core functions of the bank's operations; if a risk assessment has been carried out on the outsourcing to the bank's operations; his further views on the consultations with unions and staff; his views on the matter of outsourcing of staff in the bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Currently, these are asset based in the form of ring-fenced deposits in the deposit protection account in the Central Bank which can be called upon to fund a compensation event for depositors. However, once the new arrangements are in place, banks and credit unions will have to pay contributions to the DGS which will be reflected as a cost\u00a0 in their financial accounts.<\/p>  <p>  (iii)\u00a0 it will\u00a0not be possible to provide DGS coverage of up to &euro;100,000 for deposits held by credit unions with banks as is currently permitted.\u00a0 The rationale for this is that credit unions are classified as credit institutions and Article 5(1) of the Directive excludes from any repayment by a DGS, deposits made by other credit institutions on their own behalf and for their own account.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  (iv)\u00a0a \u00a0reduction in the number of days that a DGS must pay out within, from 20 working days to 7 working days.\u00a0 However, this is phased in over an 8 year period. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the calculation of contributions\u00a0 to the DGS (Article 13), the Directive provides that Member States may provide for lower contributions for low-risk sectors which are regulated under national law. As part of the transposition, I will give consideration as to whether credit unions can be so categorised. It should be noted that the Directive allows Member States up until 31 May 2016 to implement this Article and it is likely that we will avail of\u00a0at least some of this extra time.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware\u00a0 that I am\u00a0giving consideration to legislating for maintaining the availability of the existing deposit protection account resources in the early years of the build-up of the new fund. The purpose of such an arrangement would be to\u00a0 maintain the level of overall funds available for DGS purposes at an amount close to the existing arrangements.\u00a0This matter is still the subject of legal advice and it is almost certain that if it is permissible, primary legislation will be required in order to achieve this objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700068#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700068#WRJ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[24198\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700068#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the income tax liabilities of the key sectors of the Irish economy during each of the years 2012 to 2014, inclusive, and on the actual gross amounts of income tax contributed by each sector during that period;

This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime.<\/p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006 European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations and Article 45 and Recitals (34) and (43) of 2004\/18\/EC, the EU Directive on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches, is excluded the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.<\/p>  <p>  In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 or Article 45 of 2004\/18\/EC apply.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the current regime and standard forms of contract, there are requirements in place for compliance with legal obligations.  For example Clause 2 of the standard form of the public works contracts requires the contractor, his personnel and sub-contractors to comply with all legal requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There is a substantial body of legislation that directly or indirectly governs construction activities, however two key pieces of industry specific legislation; the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 and the Building Control Regulations 1997 2014 both place considerable responsibility, not only on contractors, but on all those involved in construction projects including designers, supervisors and individual workers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate sanction for serious breach of health and safety regulations is a criminal conviction and imprisonment.  Compliance with health and safety regulations is separately assessed in a pre-qualification of a works contractor with supporting evidence required to demonstrate the applicant possesses sufficient resources and is competent to carry out the proposed works.  The Works Requirements which are a key part of the contract documents also set out detailed specifications on how regulatory standards are to be met.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Contractors are required to submit on-going certification under Clause 5.3 (Pay and Conditions of Employment) of the contract that they have complied in full with the requirements of that clause which covers aspects such as compliance with employment law, and deductions for social welfare.  Contractors are also required under this Clause to maintain records and timesheets in respect of all those engaged on the works.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The new EU rules comprise a suite of three Directives (Public Procurement, Utilities and Concessions) that repeal the existing rules governing the conduct of procurement across the EU but the basic architecture of EU procurement will remain intact.  The changes in the new regime were agreed principally to streamline the public procurement process and to put in place more simplified and flexible rules to reduce red tape and to make the procurement process more efficient. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process.  One of the policy areas highlighted in the consultation document is adherence to \"applicable obligations\" in labour law. Each Member States has the choice on which appropriate measures to adopt to ensure compliance with this obligation as well as choices on the level of oversight down the subcontracting supply chain.  The OGP is currently exploring the appropriate measures to adopt and have sought views on this choice as part of the consultation process.  Clearly, a key objective in transposing these new provisions is to avoid imposing disproportionate administrative burden on contracting authorities and tenderers while at the same time adhering to applicable labour law obligations.

I understand that officials in that Department have worked with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure the industry was aware of, and prepared for, the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland.  I also understand that a significant number of steel fabricators operating in the State have already established the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and, more specifically, the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1.  D\/ECLG remains committed to working with all stakeholders in order to continue to raise awareness and facilitate the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland. <\/p><p>With regard to your specific question concerning the educational\/training courses provided by SOLAS for steel fabricators to meet the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1, the programmes provided by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are primarily targeted at unemployed people who are generally referred to programmes by the Department of Social Protection.  I understand that the ETBs in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training. <\/p><p>Skillnets, on the other hand, is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education and Skills and funds groups of companies in the same region\/sector, and with similar training needs, through training networks that deliver subsidised training to Irish businesses.  It may therefore be beneficial for steel fabricator companies to explore what economies of scale might be achieved for companies seeking the same upskilling in the same area.  There are no subsidies or grants available or envisaged to meet the requirements of the CPR or I.S. EN 1090-1.<\/p><p>The role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) is to provide information to small and micro firms and to signpost them to relevant agencies\/bodies for training and certification.  The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services.  However, to date, the LEOs - in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) - have provided five general awareness\/information seminars on the topic at various venues around the country. <\/p><p>In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the relevant Departments and agencies i.e. Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the LEOs and the NSAI.  Based on the information provided, my Department has devised a step-by-step guide on the current training provision in the public education sector.  The guide is available on my Department&rsquo;s website under &lsquo;Latest Publications\/Notices&rsquo; and has been distributed to the LEO network and to the relevant Departments for uploading on their websites. <\/p><p>The guide is tailored for those steel fabricator firms affected by the two key areas requiring action i.e. Responsible Welding Coordinator (RWC) and Factory Production Control (FPC) under Execution Class 2 (commercial and residential buildings).  Further courses can be provided depending on the level of demand from firms.  In relation to FPC training, this is only available through consultants.  However, as part of their information provision and advisory role, the LEOs may be able to organise group training between firms and consultants.  Firms should enquire about this through their local LEO office. In addition, the newly-formed Irish Association of Steel Fabricators has a website with useful information in relation to the CPR requirements including weld testing to meet the I.S.

CETA also introduces the possibility of a sole arbitrator when both parties agree, which would reduce costs, and also introduces limits on the fees paid to arbitrators.  <\/p><p>I am open to considering proposals that can achieve a reasonable and workable arbitration system that is fair, transparent and efficient and addresses the shortcomings of historic models of investment arbitration which have given rise to concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00650"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[24218\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is aware of impending job losses at a company (details supplied) in County Clare, despite Government's announcement last year that the company intended to create 100 additional jobs over the next year; if he will provide, in tabular form, the annual number of full-time jobs announced by the Government, via the regular jobs announcements Government statements; and of these, the actual number of jobs delivered.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>In 2014, this company announced the expansion of its facility in Shannon, County Clare, with the creation of approximately 100 new jobs over the 200 jobs already in place with the company.  These 100 jobs were created and are currently in situ. Any further announcement about its future is a matter for the company.<\/p>  <p>  So far this year IDA Ireland has announced four new projects for the Mid-West Region (Shannon and Limerick) with a job potential of over 600 people at full operation.  These companies are. Amax, Viagogo, Northern Trust and Dell.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on new job announcements, 2014 was a record year for IDA Ireland with 197 investments being secured for Ireland and 15,012 gross new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies.  There was a notable rise in new name investments with 88 new name investments being secured in 2014.  For a variety of reasons many companies do not seek any publicity on proposed investments and many projects proceed without being publicly announced. During 2014, there were only 66 investment announcements, of which 38 were new projects with the balance being made up of expansion projects.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to expansion of the Irish &ndash;owned sector, it is noteworthy that client companies of Enterprise Ireland created 19,705 jobs in 2014, which represented a net increase of 8,476 people employed in EI supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of that Agency.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the natural time lag between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project, which can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery, the recruitment and training of suitable staff and a natural developmental phase.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the time lag it is not possible to compare the numbers of jobs announced with the numbers of jobs created. In any given year the number of jobs created exceeds the number of jobs announced. Taking 2014 as an example, the IDA job announcements indicated a potential job creation figure in the region of 7,000 jobs whereas the actual number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in 2014 was in fact 15,012.<\/p>  <p>  The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey carried out by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00850"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[23991\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700070#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if Natura lands with an area of 69.931 hectares have been accepted in an application under the green low-carbon agri-environmental scheme in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>A GLAS application for the person named was received on my Department&rsquo;s online application system on the 19th May 2015.

The Forum allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector. As an example, the most recent meeting of the Forum held in February proposed the preparation of written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull and other beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.

I am advised that Garda&iacute; make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including drug related crime.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda response to the particular issues raised forms part of the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. A range of measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.  These include Operation Spire, which provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O&rsquo;Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime.  The operation is designed as a preventative measure and the area is patrolled by uniform patrols supplemented as required by Crime Prevention Unit and Divisional Crime Task Force personnel.  Garda strategy is also supported by other operations including Operation Pier which focuses on the Pearse Street District, as well as Operation Viking and Operation Clean Streets which further target the sale and supply of illicit drugs in the city centre.<\/p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a  multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse generally, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in at the Department of Health, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy. The Strategy, the implementation of which is monitored by the Oversight Forum on Drugs Group chaired by Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, adopts a pillar based approach to the problem involving the implementation of a wide range of measures across the five pillars of drug supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. The Group includes representatives from the key Departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies continue to progress the actions assigned to the criminal justice sector under the National Strategy and to actively participate in all of the structures in place under the Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700072#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700073#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[24134\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700073#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to re-open any of the Garda stations that closed under the current Government; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na completed a comprehensive review of its district and station network in 2012 and 2013.

This has been in operation since 2010. Its main objective is to provide the best value, safe care for all people with epilepsy in the right place, at the right time by sharing the best available information.<\/p>  <p>  Under the first recommendation of the resolution, the NCPE has a specific remit to describe models of care and formulate guidelines, where necessary, which aim to improve quality, access and value of clinical care. An advisory group of medical, nursing, technical and patient experts was convened with a remit to define a Model of Care for epilepsy. Consensus was rapidly agreed based on best international practice on the need to define centres of expertise nationally, to invest in nurse specialists and electronic communication, and to standardise procedures in epilepsy care. The NCPE has supported the implementation of this policy position with over 30 new Whole Time Equivalents (WTEs) in 6 defined national centres. The Model of Care has been signed off by the National Clinical Lead and Clinical Advisory Group and is being prepared for submission to the HSE Office of the National Director for Clinical Strategy and Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has also developed and supported the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record; this promotes patient safety by supporting the availability of current, accurate patient information to clinicians involved in patient care.  In addition, a suite of over 40 guidance documents (SOPs) have been developed by the NCPE. These look at the management of persons with Epilepsy across the care continuum from initial presentation, specialised treatment (including surgery) and to long-term management in primary care.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed SOP has also been developed for the management of women with epilepsy, which includes family planning, pregnancy, delivery right through to menopause. This was completed in conjunction with the National Clinical Programme for Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Three Primary Care SOPs have also been developed in conjunction with the National Clinical Programme for Primary Care to cover the critical areas of managing seizures in the community, the process of referral to specialised services and the intelligent support process for managing Epilepsy in primary care. The NCPE also contributes to the National Medicines Liaison Centre collaborative and GP bulletins with information relating to the management of Epilepsy in the Community.<\/p>  <p>  Under the second recommendation of the WHO resolution, the NCPE's Model of Care for Epilepsy advocates self management. Epilepsy specific self-management programmes, such as Epilepsy Ireland&rsquo;s STEPS programme (Support &amp;amp; Training in Epilepsy Self-management) and the &lsquo;Training for Success&rsquo; initiative run at the Sligo Institute of Technology, address more condition-specific issues such as living with Epilepsy; managing seizure triggers; lifestyle and safety; and understanding the impact of diet, exercise and sleep. The NCPE also supports the development of transitional programmes that support adolescents with epilepsy transition from paediatric services to adult services. Included in successful transition is the development of self-management and self-awareness skills to enable the young adult to take more responsibility for the management of their condition.<\/p>  <p>  For the third recommendation of the WHO resolution, the NCPE has a close working relationship with Epilepsy Ireland. The programme regularly contributes to the Epilepsy Ireland newsletter and various national and regional conferences with updated information on developments within the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on the question of research as per the fourth recommendation of the resolution, long-standing links with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Genetics group has resulted in senior participation in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) genetics consortium; this has been making important discoveries that will impact on diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy in the future.  In this regard, significant advances on epilepsy research capacity has been made in Ireland.  Furthermore, clinicians and researchers associated with the NCPE have been regular recipients of Health Research Board sponsored research grants. Other examples of research projects underway in Ireland include:<\/p>  <p>- Improving our understanding of the gene-based regulation of neuronal cell death and hippocampal remodelling in epilepsy<\/p>  <p>- European collaborative project called EpimiRNA which aims to understand molecular mechanisms, diagnostics and develop novel therapeutics for epilepsy<\/p>  <p>- Research group focused on identifying genetic predictors of the development and treatment of epilepsy<\/p>  <p>- A study on children with undiagnosed early onset epileptic encephalopathy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Recruitment","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[24153\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"whether he is aware of the significant potential loss of nurses in our nursing homes and senior citizens services; the action he will take on this urgent matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The nursing home public and private sectors are collaborating with the Department of Health and the HSE in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are two areas under active review in relation to these recruitment and retention issues. Firstly, there is the issue of recruitment of nurses educated and trained in Ireland. The HSE Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director has been supportive in allowing the nursing home sector meet with graduate students in the universities, to discuss employment opportunities. In addition, the Chief Nursing Office in the Department has been engaged with, the public and private nursing home sector in promoting nursing in the older adult as a career choice. The Office has facilitated ongoing discussions, spoken at conferences and engaged with 3rd level universities on seeking solutions to the recruitment and retention issue. These discussions have involved exploring and reviewing career pathways within older people services to encourage more staff into this area of nursing practice.<\/p>  <p>  The second area under review relates to the undertaking of initiatives for the recruitment of global nurses. The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment. A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service. If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration.<\/p>  <p>  A collaborative group including Department of Health, HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) representatives continue to explore options to facilitate adaptation. In this regard some hospitals will respond to local need from local nursing homes, and this has been encouraged within the hospital group structures; some hospitals will continue to support placements pending funding from NHI though not at peak undergraduate student times; and, some are withdrawing from the provision of clinical placements to facilitate their own internal international recruitment initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, options are being explored with an Irish university to offer a one-day programme of assessment through an examination format. It is hoped that the pilot of this programme will be complete and results available in the last quarter of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care Provision","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR01175"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[24154\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will support a matter (details supplied) regarding the Donnycarney centre for senior citizens in Dublin 5; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone. The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883\/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.<\/p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians. It will be a matter for the patient and his\/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him\/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare. This requires completion of an application process; consequently patients intending to access care under the CBD should check with the HSE in advance of travelling. The costs must be borne by the individual and he\/she then will seek reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland. The HSE will reimburse the patient for care which meets the terms of the CBD in line with the Directive. Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the healthcare had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser. All other costs associated with accessing care abroad under the CBD are a matter for the patient and will not be reimbursable by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700076#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Accommodation","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700077#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[24191\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700077#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the further funding resources he will make available at the 26 Health Service Executive nursing homes identified by the Health Information and Quality Authority as requiring accommodation upgrades; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has indicated that a number of public units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.

The study titled Cloud cover and radiation balance changes over Ireland due to aircraft induced contrails is due to be completed later this year.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department has previously been informed by Met &Eacute;ireann that vapour trails are formed through the emission of exhaust gases from jet engines of aircraft in the upper troposphere and that the main component of these gases is water vapour.\u00a0 Ambient air temperature at jet cruising altitudes is often below -500C.  Under these conditions, water vapour cools and condenses and the particles act as ice nuclei, leading to the production of ice crystals; these ice crystals are what are visible from the ground as a linear cloud of condensation. <\/p>  <p>  Depending upon atmospheric conditions, these vapour trails can rapidly dissipate or remain for some time, gradually spreading horizontally into an extensive thin cirrus cloud layer.  Water in the atmosphere commonly evaporates to become water vapour.\u00a0 As a general rule, the drier the air the more effective this evaporation process will be. Under more humid conditions, there will be less effective evaporation and so contrails will generally last longer in more humid air.  Contrail formation is also influenced by wind speeds, with higher winds disrupting and breaking up contrail formation.   <\/p>  <p>  Contrails do not adversely impact ambient air quality in Ireland.  Met &Eacute;ireann advises that there is some evidence that contrails can influence climatology but they have little impact on day-to-day weather.  The purported reason for the former is that the contrails (or consequent cirrus cloud) will trap outgoing long-wave radiation, thus leading to warming in the atmosphere, and that this effect is greater than the reflection of short-wave radiation from the sun.\u00a0   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700080#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700080#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[24031\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700080#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will remove an estate (details supplied) from consideration under the Homeless Action Plan, in view of the regeneration project planned between Dublin City Council and the Gaelic Athletic Association.","asker":"1008","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>On 4 December 2014, I hosted a special Summit on Homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.

It estimates that 47% of total supply over the period is required across the Dublin Region. The Agency notes that 57% of all households in the Dublin region over this period will be for one and two persons, while a further 18% will be for three person households.<\/p><p>Analysis by the ESRI has estimated that, in coming years, increases in population will result in the formation of at least 20,000 new households each year, each requiring a separate dwelling.

Specifically:<\/p>  <p>  - there will be 250,000 people employed in tourism;<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland will welcome ten million overseas visits compared with 7.6 million in 2014; and<\/p>  <p>  - overseas visitor revenue, net of any inflation effect,\u00a0will be\u00a0&euro;5 billion compared with &euro;3.5 billion in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Tourism Policy Statement set out a range of policy objectives to achieve these targets.\u00a0 I will shortly announce the members of a Tourism Leadership Group who will oversee the preparation of a three-year Tourism Action Plan that will set out specific actions required in the period up to 2018 in order to achieve the policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700085#WRAA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sport and Recreational Development","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700085#WRAA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[24081\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061700085#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding funding for football (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport, including the allocation of funding\u00a0for the National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) which includes the Football Association of Ireland.
