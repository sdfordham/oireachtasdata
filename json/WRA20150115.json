This Commission of Investigation arises on foot of the recommendations of Mr Se&aacute;n Guerin, SC, in his report of 6 May 2014 to An Taoiseach, based on his examination of how allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe concerning certain cases connected to the Cavan\/Monaghan Garda Division were handled. All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  The case referred to by the Deputy is amongst the complaints being considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach,  with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.<\/p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur. However I would also make the point again that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Controls","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[1406\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on changes to be made in the Garda National Immigration Bureau to end long queues outside their office on Burgh Quay in Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>I first of all wish to assure the Deputy that there are currently no queues and all applicants for services at the public offices on Burgh Quay are dealt with on the same day.<\/p>  <p>  I have already provided the Deputy with a comprehensive response to a similar question on 11th  December last. The public offices in Burgh Quay service two separate functions &ndash; one dealing with non-EEA nationals seeking to register and renew their permission to be in the State, a function which is carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and a separate function dealing with applicants for re-entry visas to allow for short trips outside the State, usually for holidays. This latter function is carried out by staff of Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and it is in connection with this function, rather than the registration function, that the issue with queuing arose before Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  As I informed the Deputy on that occasion, neither I, as Minister, nor my officials wish for any applicants for services provided by my Department to feel that they have to queue outside office hours for long periods, particularly in the cold weather conditions which prevailed at that time.  In this particular case, there is absolutely no need to do so because, unlike the registration functions, it is not a requirement of the re-entry visa applicants to turn up in person.  Applications may be made by registered post and many thousands of applications are processed annually in this way.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, there was, during December last, an unprecedented level of demand for re-entry visas &ndash; well above volumes of previous years.  Given this sudden increase in demand, decisive action was taken with significant additional resources re-deployed to the re-entry visa office with the result that by the end of the first week in December, all the postal applications on hand had been dealt with and all persons who came to the public office were dealt with on the same day. That continued to be the case right through December and is so to date.<\/p>  <p>  To avoid a recurrence of such unexpected demand and queues developing, I have asked my officials to bring forward their proposals for the introduction of an on-line appointment service for the re-entry visa process. Design of the system is underway and is now expected to be in place by the end of the first quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  This is part of the wider reform programme for the more effective and efficient delivery of immigration services which is underway.  This includes the transfer of registration functions from the GNIB to INIS.  This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS will be extending its on-line services to the registration area as part of this process.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the current registration process operated by the GNIB in Burgh Quay, this function is working normally with all callers being dealt with on the day so there is no requirement to queue for this service.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, it would be ideal if all immigration related business could be done through the postal system (as can currently be done in the case of  re-entry visas) or through on-line services. However, in common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at the offices of the Minister. This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure. Accordingly, we must devise systems that meet the needs of our customers while at the same time maintaining appropriate checks and balances within the system. I believe the reform programme underway will achieve both of these aims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 10 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[1402\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way she plans to address the increasing scourge of burglaries in both urban and rural areas; the latest statistics on this issue; the way she plans to ensure crime statistics are reported in an accurate manner; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Tackling burglary is a joint priority for both myself and the Garda Commissioner, and I assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that there is an effective policing response in place, and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.<br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursue a range of strategies to tackle this type of crime, including in particular the coordinated national strategy targeting burglary, Operation Fiacla.

My primary concern, in introducing these provisions, is to vindicate the human rights of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Over 80% of women trafficked are the victims of sexual exploitation.<\/p>  <p>  These proposals were developed following an extensive consultation process, initiated by my Department in 2012, including a Discussion Document which presented an objective analysis of the approaches adopted in other jurisdictions to address prostitution.  I would draw attention to a March 2014 Council of Europe Report entitled \"Prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe\".  That Report reviews the approaches adopted in a number of countries and concludes that member states should consider \"criminalising the purchase of sexual services, based on the Swedish model, as the most effective tool for preventing and combating trafficking in human beings\". There is no suggestion that this approach adopted by a number of countries is in conflict with international human rights requirements.  Indeed in February 2014, the European Parliament adopted a resolution advocating this approach.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has also recommended criminalising the purchase of sexual services by means of prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  Independent statistics on crime, including prostitution and related offences, are collated and published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  In addition to the material collated by the CSO, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department has, since January 2009, operated a data collection strategy in relation to human trafficking.  The purpose of the strategy is to gain a more informed view of the nature and extent of trafficking in human beings in Ireland in terms of what was being encountered by both governmental and non-governmental organisations.  The data is published by the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in its Annual Report.  Because of the hidden nature of these activities, there are limitations with relation to the statistics.  However this applies to all jurisdictions and I am not aware of any other approach that would provide more accurate and objective statistics.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the new offences is to send a clear message that the purchase of sexual services in the context of prostitution is unlawful and the evidence suggests that making an act unlawful does in itself influence behaviour.  There will of course be some prosecutions and of course as with any covert activity, this can present challenges.  The Deputy however will appreciate that this is an operational policing matter and one which will properly be dealt with by the Garda authorities, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  The trafficking of persons and the organisation of prostitution is a feature of organised criminality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already strongly committed to the disruption of the organised crime networks behind this activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Inspectorate Reports","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[1416\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide in detail action taken by her on the findings of the Garda Inspectorate report chapter relating to the Guerin report and the Secretary General vacancy in her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The introduction of the single procedure, together with other reforms in the proposed Bill, will enhance our capacity to efficiently grant international protection to those who are entitled to it.  At the same time, it will identify, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.<\/p>  <p>  This approach does not lose sight of the other necessary elements of legislative reform in this area. Work on an Immigration and Residence Bill will also continue by reference to such further matters as the visa regime, entry into the State, residence, removal from the State while also dealing with specific challenges such as those of human trafficking and marriages of convenience. In this way any development of the respective Bills will give mutual support to the ongoing roll-out of reform of our immigration regime while also allowing the Government to be responsive to the present and very pressing need for a single procedure for the examination of applications for international protection in this jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Accommodation","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[1398\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500050#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the urgent need to provide new accommodation for Bailieborough Garda District Headquarters, County Cavan; if this project is likely to proceed to construction in 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is based on requirements which are established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I will meet with Minister Ford again in the near future and we will have an opportunity to review these issues.

The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<br\/><br\/>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976] I.R. 325<\/i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. <\/i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<br\/><br\/>I can inform the Deputy that a  new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reports","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[1278\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the publication of the report following the audit by the Garda professional standards units which was completed in 2014.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that I expect to receive a report from the Garda Commissioner in the near future with respect to the audit referred to and, as I have previously indicated, I intend to put its findings into the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Investigations","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[1279\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500051#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the waiting times for processing complaints received by GSOC.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is a statutory independent body which is independent in the exercise of its functions and I have no function in relation to the processing of individual complaints which are referred to it for investigation.<\/p>  <p>  I am however advised by the Ombudsman Commission that, conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective service for its various stakeholders, they have invested considerable time and energy to decreasing the duration of investigations arising from complaints.

However, entitlement to Irish citizenship under Section 6(3) is determined by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, as is the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children born in Northern Ireland to certain foreign nationals. Children of Non-EEA\/Swiss parents who do not meet the residency requirements, do not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. However, in this case, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State.  This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a certificate of nationality can be issued to a person as evidence that they were, as of the date of issue, an Irish citizen. The cases in question were referred to the Citizenship Division for consideration in respect of children born in the State.

This evaluation is ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that remit was significantly extended under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. However, after careful consideration of all the issues involved, it was determined that the administration of the law relating to immigration or naturalisation, should not be within the scope of the Ombudsman. Part of the consideration was the fact that there are already a significant number of appeal processes built into the system including Judicial Reviews. That said, the matter will be kept under review.  I should also add that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has administrative arrangements in place with the Ombudsman's Office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention. <\/p>  <p>  The present provisions governing Jus Soli entitlement to Irish citizenship were enacted following the Twenty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution inserting Article 9.2, which provides that a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law.

The social insurance system is mandatory and insures nearly all workers and the self-employed for a range of contingencies such as old age, ill health, maternity and unemployment.  The range of contingencies covered is dependent on the Class of PRSI paid.<\/p>  <p>  Social insurance spending has traditionally been funded on a tripartite basis &ndash; with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees.  Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over 40 years.  The Revised Estimates for 2014 provided for a subvention of &euro;690 million from voted expenditure to fund the deficit on the SIF with the Revised Estimates provision in 2015 being &euro;180 million, a reduction of over half a billion euro.<\/p>  <p>  One of my key priorities as Minister for Social Protection is to put the Social Insurance Fund on a sustainable footing.  A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions. <\/p>  <p>  The structural PRSI measures implemented in recent Budgets will have a positive and long-term impact on the funding of the SIF.  These measures include increases in rates of contribution, the abolition of ceilings for charging PRSI, the abolition of relief from PRSI previously applied to employee pension contributions, the abolition of the PRSI-free allowance as well as the broadening of the base on which PRSI is charged through the abolition of exemptions.  These revenue raising measures were accompanied by expenditure reducing measures including stricter contribution conditions for entitlement, reductions in duration of entitlement, removal of entitlement to concurrent social insurance payments, increases in pension age as well as major reductions in entitlements under the treatment benefits and redundancy payments schemes.  As I have already indicated the 2015 Revised Estimate provides for the Exchequer Subvention to fall to &euro;180 million in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund is driven by: <\/p>  <p>  i. Social Insurance Fund Income from PRSI receipts; <\/p>  <p>  ii. Expenditure on SIF schemes &ndash; the main variables being demographic pressures relating to pensions and the Live Register. <\/p>  <p>  Social Insurance Fund income peaked at over &euro;8.1 billion in 2008.  It fell to &euro;6.7 billion by 2010.  The 2015 Budget Estimate forecast that it will be &euro;8.2 billion this year, exceeding the pre-crash value for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  Arising from demographic pressures, expenditure on pensions is increasing by &euro;200 million each year.  The Live Register rose from an average of 162,000 in 2007 to over 440,000 in 2010 and 2011.  It has since fallen each year and is expected to average below 390,000 in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December, 2010, highlighted the growing deficit in the Fund and the prospect that it will, in the absence of measures to address the deficit, accelerate further in the future, driven primarily by pension costs.  It is estimated that almost &euro;1 billion additional provision will be required over the next 5 years to fund increases in the numbers of recipients of the State pension (contributory) scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Based on macro-economic forecasts provided by the Department of Finance, it is expected that Social Insurance Fund income will continue to rise over the period 2016 to 2018 by an amount greater than the requirement for additional pension expenditure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500052#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":106,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":107,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 42 and 43 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Eligibility","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500053#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[2039\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500053#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if basic supplementary welfare payment may be made in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>An emergency needs payment issued to the person concerned on the 13<sup>th<\/sup>January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500053#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief Application","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500053#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[2041\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500053#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding mortgage support in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>The purpose of Mortgage Interest Supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.

It is available on my Department's website at .\u00a0 The following are the key findings of the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges undertaken by my Department:<br\/><br\/>- net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers,<br\/><br\/>- net fees and commissions are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income,<br\/><br\/>- fee and commission income have become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years and\u00a0banks have been able to increase fee and commission income since 2009 despite the restrictions imposed by section 149,<br\/><br\/>- Section 149 does appear to exert a restraining effect on the development of innovative products by the existing banks in Ireland but this may not be to the detriment of consumers,<br\/><br\/>- Section 149 may lead to inefficiency in pricing of financial products by the banks in Ireland, and <br\/><br\/>- Low customer mobility may mean that banks can increase prices without fearing a loss of customers.<br\/><br\/>The review also found that competition in the Irish banking sector has reduced significantly since the onset of the economic crisis and that this reduction is not related to Section 149.\u00a0 The review considered a number of possible changes to the existing regime but concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this point in time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.\u00a0The Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 did\u00a0introduce changes to\u00a0Section 149 to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector. There is some evidence of\u00a0improvement in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.<br\/><br\/>I would advise consumers\u00a0who wish to compare current account offerings\u00a0to look at \u00a0the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\u00a0 website at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Laundering","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[1979\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on ways of putting diesel launderers out of business; if he will review the current green diesel system, which provides enormous business potential for launderers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the threat posed by diesel laundering and have implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.\u00a0 This strategy includes the following elements: <\/p>  <p>  - The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<\/p>  <p>  - A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<\/p>  <p>  - New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<\/p>  <p>  - Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, a new supply chain reporting regime was introduced from January 2013, which requires all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation;<\/p>  <p>  - Following a joint process with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom, a new, more effective fuel marker was identified and will be implemented in the two jurisdictions from the end of March next; and<\/p>  <p>  - Intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I introduced a 'reckless trading' provision In Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This provision has strengthened Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers. \u00a0In Finance Act 2014, I introduced provisions to strengthen further Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.\u00a0Revenue's strategy has already yielded significant results. Since mid-2011, 137 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions, over three million litres of fuel have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down. \u00a0Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and road diesel consumption and tax revenues are up 13% compared with a couple of years ago. Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is an important factor.\u00a0\u00a0It has been suggested on a number of occasions that the current system of marking lower taxed fuels should be replaced by one based on repayments to the users. \u00a0However, a change of this nature would impact on a wide range of users, would be costly to implement and would, itself, be at risk from fraud.\u00a0 Marked gas oil has a wide variety of uses, including the propulsion of trains, in agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, for commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and commercial and home heating purposes.\u00a0 A change to a rebate system would involve the establishment of an expensive and wide-ranging repayments system and would place a new administrative burden on oil traders, on the large number of users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also impose significant cash-flow costs on those currently using marked gas oil.\u00a0Repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging repayment scheme would not offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.\u00a0 Fuel in respect of which a repayment of duty was made could be easily diverted to on-road use.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, and in light of the progress made by Revenue in tackling the problem, I am satisfied that the strategy being implemented by Revenue is the best course of action. I am also confident that the introduction of the new marker here and in the United Kingdom from the end of March will reinforce the measures already implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[1985\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500055#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for 2015 to recover public moneys diverted to the banking system in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the Irish banking system is now in a much stronger position than it has been in recent years.

The PAS operates under licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments and is independent in its operations.<\/p>  <p>  While the Deputy does not stipulate a particular competition, PAS has confirmed that the individual for whom details were supplied was a candidate for the Temporary Clerical Officer (TCO) campaign which is run annually to meet gaps arising on foot of term-time leave, maternity leave and other short-term staff needs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the TCO campaign attracted 13,200 applications.  Given the scale of interest in the competition and urgency of temporary assignments, PAS does not have scope to delay if a candidate cannot take up duty promptly.  The Information Booklet for the competition is clear in terms of the obligation on candidates to be available to take up duty when required and to see out the contract.<\/p>  <p>  The needs of departments\/offices seeking TCO cover are immediate and typically short-term and as such the system must be responsive.

IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.  When marketing Kerry for new inward investment IDA Ireland focuses on the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors. <br\/><br\/>2014 marks the end of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s 5 year Strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;.

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  Regional Aid is also provided under Schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.  All such aid come from the Exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding.  The 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines entered into force on 1 July 2014.  Areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population are now eligible for assistance under the Regional Aid Guidelines.  This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map.  This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are now available in Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines specify the grant aid rates for Regional Aid projects.  The Deputy is correct in acknowledging an improvement in the aid rate applicable for eligible projects in Kerry.  This specifically relates to the aid rate for large companies, which has increased from 0% to 10% for the period 2014-2020.  The Regional aid rates for Kerry and other areas designated under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines are a maximum of 30% for small and micro enterprises, 20% for medium-sized enterprises and 10% for large enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2014, Enterprise Ireland has not to date, approved Regional Aid to any large company in Kerry.

In the six months since 1  July 2014, Enterprise Ireland approved more than &euro;5.7 million to companies in Kerry for start-up, research and development, and expansion projects.  All projects are subject to assessment in terms of commercial, technical and market due diligence and should represent value for money in terms of the State&rsquo;s investment.<\/p>  <p>  During 2014, there were no public investment announcements of IDA Ireland projects for County Kerry.  However, it should be noted that not all companies agree to announce their investments and as a result, this does not truly reflect the level of investments won or the performance of FDI in a county in a particular year.  In this respect, IDA Ireland clients had a very positive employment performance in County Kerry with a net increase of 236 jobs in 2014, compared with 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Kerry Local Enterprise Office continues to work with its micro enterprise client base in Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500057#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobs Data","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500057#WRH01550"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[1996\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500057#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the jobs lost and created in IDA supported employment for each of the years 2008 to 2014.","asker":"1192","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>In the 7 year period from 2008 to 2014, the total numbers employed in IDA Ireland client companies rose by almost 15,000, from 159,556 in 2008 to 174,488 in 2014, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.

This is particularly true of a huge market like the US, even more so given we are the first EU member State to secure such access which I believe is testimony to the quality and production values associated with Irish beef.  The total US beef market is estimated at 11 million metric tonnes. It is split 60: 40 between food service and grocery retail (by volume). The US imports 1.2m tonnes of beef every year and demand for Irish beef there is expected to be immediate and exceptionally strong.  I know that some of the leading Irish beef exporters have had people on the ground in the US for some time now in preparation for this announcement and they are reporting huge opportunities for Irish companies when the trade commences.  Bord Bia has identified the primary target for US market entry as key culinary centres such as New York City, Boston and Washington DC, followed by listings in premium grocery retailers initially in the North Eastern states.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the opening of any new market is good news for our beef producers, bringing as it does new outlets and new market opportunities which ultimately form the basis for the returns to the primary producers.  Irish farmers undertake a variety of beef production systems and the specific practice of raising beef weanlings should benefit from the opening of the US market given that weanling prices are influenced by deadweight prices achieved through meat factories and by future projections of supply and demand, both in Ireland and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the coming year, the forecast is for some slight improvement in Irish cattle prices in 2015 as a result of tighter Irish cattle supplies and a shift in the UK beef supply and use balance.

However I would expect that some indirect benefits may arise through downward pressure in contracting charges and fertiliser costs, although other factors may mitigate the extent to which these costs may fall. These factors include profitability challenges in the contracting sector and falling fertiliser manufacturing capacity in Europe over the past 10 years, which has reduced market supplies. Feed costs are not as heavily impacted by fuel prices and, although the costs of drying, processing and transport will be reduced, other factors will come into play such as global growing and harvest conditions in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  On a broader level I note and welcome the fact that generally input prices are falling, as the CSO&rsquo;s agricultural input price index was down 3.5% on annual basis in November 2014 compared with November 2013.

My Department is currently awaiting the report of the visit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Irish Embassy in Beijing will continue to engage with the Chinese authorities in order to progress this matter with a view to obtaining access to the Chinese market for Irish beef in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500060#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licence Eligibility","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500060#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[2112\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500060#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in view of the determination process of aquaculture licensing, his plans to carry out an appropriate assessment on Kincasslagh Bay in County Donegal to ensure compliance with the EU birds and habitats directives; when such an assessment on the bay will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>Kincasslagh Bay is located within Gweedore Bay and Islands Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

My Department is working with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to achieve full compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives through a multi-annual work programme. This programme required the gathering of the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of aquaculture sites located within designated Natura areas. This data collection programme, which is substantially complete, together with the setting of Conservation Objectives, will enable all new and renewal aquaculture applications to be assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. This work is ongoing and a great deal of progress has been made to date.<\/p>  <p>  The Appropriate Assessment process has been completed in respect of a number of bays. While these Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually. Factors to be considered include location of the site within the bay, species, scale, etc. In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment.

For ease of reference this is set out hereunder.<blockquote><i>The first thing I want to emphasise is that I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in relation to prosecutions or decisions whether or not to initiate a prosecution.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In May 2013, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) made a Report to my predecessor under Section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 following its investigation into allegations of collusion between an individual and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In its letter accompanying the report GSOC stated that a file relating to its public interest investigation was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual.  Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/i><br \/><br \/><i>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources  many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as agents provocateur. <\/i><br \/><br \/><i>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014.  I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full cooperation  from relevant members of An Garda Siochana  in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda Siochana.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007.  However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation.  A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner. <\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment)(No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and for the removal of body organs.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>This legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking)(Amendment) Act 2013 also provided, for the first time, a definition of 'forced labour' in Irish law, based on the International Labour Organisation's definition.<br\/><br\/>I am, of course, committed to keeping under review the adequacy of the measures taken to combat human trafficking, including legislation. In that context, I published on 27 November 2014 the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014 which includes two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services. The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. <br\/><br\/>Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution. It is estimated that over 80% of persons trafficked in Europe are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  The purpose of this new legislation is to reduce the demand for the services of victims of human trafficking who are being sexually exploited in prostitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN00950"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[2021\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to introduce laws to deal with white collar crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The term 'white collar' crime is not formally defined.  It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.<br\/><br\/>There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals. <br\/><br\/>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current and future investigations.<br\/><br\/>Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial.<br\/><br\/>While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.<br\/><br\/>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will be published in the coming months.  The Bill will:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation<br \/><br \/>-address the bribery of foreign public officials<br \/><br \/>-provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents<br \/><br \/>-include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence<br \/><br \/>-take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as bribes<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;<br \/><br \/>-where a public official has failed to declare interests as required by ethics legislation; and<br \/><br \/>-where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[2033\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500062#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the residency status of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned has had their permission to remain in the State renewed for a further twelve month period, valid to 14th January, 2016.

It is open to a person who is in the situation referred to by the Deputy to seek to have their case considered on its merits and to respect the decision that is ultimately made.

This  includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity and terrorism.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have also clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.<\/p>  <p>  There have been other recent positive developments with regard to the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An intake of 200 new recruits, including 25 reserve Garda&iacute;, commenced training in 2014 and a further 100 recruits  are due to enter the training college at the end of this month.

Of this 3,169 were serving prison sentences.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, health care, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.<\/p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision of higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<\/p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody aiming to give useful skills and serve the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  Training activities are designed to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  The areas include catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, woodwork, construction, industrial skills and gym.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.<\/p>  <p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that figures that the latest available figures (22\/11\/14 - 28\/11\/14) show that an overall total of 1,816 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 48% of the prisoner population at that time.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly an average of 1,051 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in November and this represents 28% of the average prison population in that month. It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500064#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organised Crime","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500064#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[2101\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500064#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members of organised criminal groups who have been charged with serious crimes annually during the past five years; those convicted or found not guilty for whatever reason; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The investigation will thoroughly examine the experience of the many mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998.

As well as contributing to high levels of ED admissions, these factors can present difficulties in discharging such patients to home or other appropriate care settings.  In addition, changes in service provision (e.g. cancer services) have increased the general patient attendance at Beaumont, placing additional pressures on bed capacity.<\/p>  <p>  All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community.  All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised. Elective surgeries (with the exception of cancer cases) have been cancelled for this week and this option is being kept under constant review.  With regard to nursing shortages, Beaumont Hospital is  working with other major hospitals to initiate an overseas recruitment campaign to help meet their needs for nursing staff.  The HSE would encourage patients to contact their GPs in the first instance where they can be directed appropriately to services such as rapid access clinics, day hospital services for older people and acute medical assessment units, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500067#WRS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500068#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[2019\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500068#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding funding for medical treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>In relation to the individual case raised, the HSE has been asked to investigate the specific issues surrounding this case and respond directly to you.

However, Ministers will have a comprehensive discussion on the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Russia and it is likely that the situation in eastern Ukraine will be raised in the context of this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis in Ukraine and its impact on relations with Russia remains a major foreign policy challenge for the EU.  Following Russia&rsquo;s illegal annexation of Crimea in March and clear evidence of its ongoing direct involvement in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the response of the EU has been graduated.<\/p>  <p>  A three-phase approach was agreed by EU leaders at the March European Council, beginning with the suspension of talks on a proposed new EU-Russia agreement and on visa liberalization (Phase 1), moving to asset freezes and visa bans (Phase 2) and culminating at the end of July with a move to targeted sectoral sanctions (Phase 3).  The latter measures were further strengthened in early September following a serious deterioration of the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The sanctions were imposed in response to Russia&rsquo;s actions in Ukraine and with the clear aim of encouraging a change in its behaviour towards its neighbour.  They are designed to be flexible and can be intensified or lessened depending on developments on the ground in Ukraine. <\/p>  <p>  The ceasefire agreements signed in Minsk last September provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.  It is crucial, therefore, that all sides, including the Russian Federation, follow through on the commitments that they signed up to under these accords.  The lack of progress on key elements of the agreements in the intervening period is deeply disappointing.  Serious violations of the ceasefire in certain parts of eastern Ukraine occur on an almost daily basis and the current situation remains very fragile. <\/p>  <p>  I remain of the view that the restrictive measures against Russia, coupled with open dialogue and continued political and economic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, offer the best way of creating the conditions for a breakthrough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500070#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Expenditure","counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500070#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":569,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[2020\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500070#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount paid out in foreign aid over the past five years; the percentage of GDP this applies to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme, which is at the heart of our foreign policy.  &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; our policy on International Development, sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and reaffirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.<br\/><br\/>Over the past five years Ireland has provided a total of over &euro;3.0 billion in Official Development Assistance (ODA).

This approach ha s a number of policy advantages as it makes water charges more affordable for lower income groups; conservation ensures a better use of our water resources and avoids unnecessary or premature expansion of water treatment plants; and it is environmentally sustainable and protects our water environment which is to the benefit of all citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500072#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Library Services","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500072#WRX01050"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[1902\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500072#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount owed in non-recouped library fees to councils who operate library services; if he will provide the total figure for amounts owed in fines to all local authorities; if he will provide a breakdown of the figures by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>The charging of library fees and levying of fines and all decisions relating to the management of library fines and fees are operational matters for local authorities.

Following this review, all towns with populations greater than 15,000 people were added to the smoky coal ban, which aligned the ban more closely with EPA air quality monitoring zones and provided for greater consistency in air quality standards for major urban areas.  In addition, the boundaries of most pre-existing ban areas were reviewed to take account of more recent urban development and census data.  In County Kildare, the review resulted in amendments to the boundaries of the ban areas in Naas, Celbridge and Leixlip as well as the addition of the town of Newbridge, with effect from May 2013.   No change was made to the status of Maynooth then, as the population of the town was below the threshold for compulsory inclusion and no representation was made at that time for the ban to be further extended elsewhere in the county. <\/p>  <p>  Kildare County Council subsequently voted in favour of a motion calling for the extension of the ban to Maynooth and wrote to inform my Department of this in June 2013.

Recent years have seen an increase in interest in the potential of the Irish Offshore as evidenced by:<\/p>  <p>  - Today, Ireland has the highest number of exploration authorisations in place, since exploration began in our offshore four decades ago; and<\/p>  <p>  - The level of seismic acquisition has risen significantly with more 2D and 3D seismic acquired in the period 2013 to 2014 than in the preceding ten years combined.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland's offshore basins. Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 or less wells per year.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland competes for exploration investment and there have been significant changes in petroleum markets over the past year, however it is anticipated that drilling levels will increase from a low base over the next two to five years, as drilling commitments now in place are delivered and as new drilling commitments are entered into following on from decisions made by companies currently investing in seismic acquisition.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to production, it is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas field pipeline will shortly be completed, with first gas anticipated in mid-2015. With successful exploration and development, Ireland has potential to benefit from its natural resources of oil and gas in terms of taxation of profits, strengthened energy security of supply and from the economic activity generated through the construction and production phases of any new development. I understand that more than 1,000 jobs have been generated over the past five years in respect of the development of the Corrib field.<\/p>  <p>  What we are witnessing in our offshore is positive and there is a clear forward momentum.

The 1926 Census is the next full set of Census records, after the 1911 returns, which is available to the State. However, current legislative provisions, as contained in the Statistics Act 1993, require that census data must be withheld for 100 years. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time to release the 1926 Census returns before the statutory period has elapsed in 2026. If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years, a<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>major<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>change in legislation and policy would be required to allow for the early release.

The Group has examined this complex project and has assessed the significant resources - in terms of additional financial, staff and infrastructural resources - that will need to be in place to move the project forward to completion. I can say that, following discussions within the Working Group, I am of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to prepare the 1926 Census database for processing, and eventual digitisation to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain, should continue. It must be recognised, however, that, in light of the level of additional resources that will be necessary, and of the current engagement by the National Archives on a number of other important projects, including some that form a key part of the programme for the Decade of Commemorations, it will be necessary to work over time towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the 1926 Census project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011500076#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"973"}]
