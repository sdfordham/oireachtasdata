The families were informed of this error.  They were also advised by Bus &Eacute;ireann that from the 2015-16 school year these children may only avail of school transport on a concessionary basis.  Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of conditions, including payment of the annual charge.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann determines distance eligibility by measuring the shortest traversable route which may be either pedestrian or vehicular from a family's home to their nearest school.  The main purpose of this measurement is to identify the distance families reside from their nearest school and assess if they meet the distance eligibility criterion for school transport.  In the interests of equity, this is applied on a consistent standard basis across the country, irrespective of local circumstances that may impact on travel conditions on particular routes during parts of the year.  The Deputy asked whether it was in the gift of the Minister to alter this.  We had this discussion previously.  The scheme must be fair throughout the country and that is what is happening.  When an error occurs, it is corrected to ensure the scheme is implemented fairly across the board.  That is the way it must be.  The Deputy raised this issue previously and said parts of the route could not be traversed in winter.  The bus route will not pass through the Mamore Gap because the route is planned to suit individuals eligible to use the bus service.

There are, therefore, many areas where we are under pressure to spend money.  We have, by and large, managed to retain the grants scheme, despite the economic downturn, but we will have to make very difficult choices.  There is no discrimination in regard to it being a case of rural Ireland versus urban Ireland in terms of access to grants or accommodation.  As I said, there are many students who do not live near enough to their college to live at home, whether in urban or rural Ireland.  I have already addressed the issue of accommodation.  The Deputy knows that the Government has significantly increased the amount of money for housing, on which we made a significant announcement this year, despite the economic difficulties, and will continue to do so.

For that reason, one of the key objectives of the task force I established jointly with the Minister for Justice and Equality to assist affected students was to develop solutions that could provide alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate for students impacted on by the closures who were not covered by learner protection arrangements.  The MEI offer to provide course places at a fee of &euro;60 per week continues to be available to genuinely displaced students.  This fee which was calculated on a cost provision basis represents a significant discount of 70% on the standard fees for an MEI school in acknowledgement that a fee has already been paid to the closed college.  Furthermore, individual MEI schools have facilitated displaced students by allowing them to make weekly payments instead of requiring the total course fee on enrolment to provide further support in managing the payment.<\/p>  <p>  My two priorities, in introducing the reforms to the international education sector, have been to protect the students who come to study in Ireland and to protect our national reputation for offering high quality education.  These reforms will deliver on both of these important priorities.

Our thoughts must also be with the families of all the other victims of this senseless act.  In particular, I extend our deepest condolences to the British Government and people.  They have suffered an immense loss with the murder of 30 British holiday makers and the impact on that country will be profound.<\/p>  <p>  As someone who was privileged to visit Tunisia on holiday more than a decade ago, I have a fond memory of a beautiful country and lovely people.  Thousands of Irish people travel to Tunisia and elsewhere in North Africa every year.  In doing so, they support local jobs and communities and help local people to earn a living through a thriving tourism industry.  In turn, visitors are there to relax, enjoy the weather and surroundings and take in some of the ancient history and sights of the area.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, horror visited the beaches of Tunisia last Friday.  We await the full details of the attack, but it is clear that it is a further senseless act of terrorism.  No cause, no ideology and no purpose is served by such random killing and murder.  I assure the families that the Government, through our embassy and consular staff, is doing as much as possible to return the bodies of the victims.  I also echo the advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs for Irish people currently in Tunisia, or those planning to visit, to be vigilant.  As an immediate priority, they should make contact with the consular service of the Department for the latest advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000018#Q00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435676700,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute;, ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le clanna agus c&aacute;irde go l&eacute;ir muintir Carty agus Hayes as ucht an d&uacute;nmhar&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach a tharla i Tunisia laethanta &oacute; shin.

Their families and friends are devastated at this sudden and shocking loss.  What happened on the beach in Tunisia was a massacre, an appalling murder by fundamentalists who target people at will.  It is an attack on civilisation as we know it and is serious for many reasons.  People have been attacked and murdered in a mindless way on an ongoing basis and the attack in Tunisia represents a further escalation of that type of wanton attack.  It was an appalling atrocity and 39 people's lives were ruthlessly and recklessly taken as they lay on a beach.<\/p>  <p>  We know that Lorna Carty went on holidays to Tunisia with her husband Declan who was recovering from a recent bypass.  They were no doubt both relieved that the surgery had gone well and they left their farm to relax on a sun-filled holiday.  Their son Simon was minding the farm and their daughter Hazel was away on holidays, after finishing exams.  It is horrific to think of the suddenness and appalling, shocking circumstances of how Lorna was barbarically and ruthlessly murdered and taken from her beloved family.  She was a nurse who spent her lifetime looking after others in her community.  Not far from Lorna on the beach were Larry and Martina Hayes.  They were also enjoying their holiday and were brutally murdered in broad daylight as they were sunbathing.  They were a popular, well liked and well known couple from Athlone and their only daughter Sinead is now left without her beloved parents.  It is too shocking to comprehend.<\/p>  <p>  We also sympathise with all of those who died and their families.  Our near neighbours in Britain suffered the biggest loss of life since the 7\/7 bomb attacks in London ten years ago.  We sympathise with all of the British families who have also lost their loved ones.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we reflect on the nature of these attacks on our citizens.  Europe and the civilised world need to act cohesively and urgently to stop the corrosive malignancy that extremist groups like ISIS bring when they infiltrate communities and endeavour to persuade young men and women to murder with such an absence of any feeling for their fellow human beings.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Cooney who moved to Tunisia from Madrid to be with the families and thank the Department for the consular assistance it is providing.  It is crucial the families get all the support they can get in shocking circumstances such as this and I have no doubt that they will.

They were people who went on their holidays, who were planning to come home with stories of fun, stories of new friends they had met on holidays and perhaps plans to meet with them again 12 months later in Tunisia.  Instead of that, we had stories of horror and we now await the return of their mortal remains to this country.  The Hayes and Kelly families are well known and well respected in Athlone and south Roscommon.  We have seen the tragic atrocities that have taken place involving ISIS in other parts of Europe and throughout the world but we would never have expected that it would come to our own local communities.  I reiterate and reverberate the sympathy that has been expressed here today to Sinead Hayes and the relatives of the other families that have had their lives torn apart.  I acknowledge the assistance of ambassador Cooney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials in helping the families through this very difficult time.

People need to approach the crisis from very credible perspectives.  In that context, I refer to remarks the Taoiseach made during the week on the situation, and in particular the manner in which he entered the fray, hectoring and lecturing and offering advice to the Greek Government, and in the process telling very big untruths.  The Taoiseach said, \"We did not increase income tax.  We did not increase VAT.  We did not increase PRSI\".  Most people found that statement and those remarks incredible.  The economist, Seamus Coffey, summed it up succinctly when he said in speaking of the Taoiseach, \"He is clearly wrong.  Everything he said we did not do; we did do\".  In budget 2012 the standard rate of VAT was increased from 21% to 23%.  That is a fact.  The PRSI weekly allowance was abolished and the minimum PRSI contribution from the self-employed was significantly increased.  Many additional charges and taxes, 45 in total, were introduced by the Government.  I have a list of them with me.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach was saying to Mr. Tsipras that if he pretends there are no tax increases, he will be fine and everything will be all right.<\/p>  <p>  I say that knowing there are no easy solutions to a debt crisis.  Hard decisions must be made.  Very difficult decisions were made in this country, not least by a government of which I was a member.  I equally accept that the Greek Government is behaving irresponsibly and playing Russian roulette with its own people.  I do not approve of how the Greek Government is approaching the situation.  Ultimately, the Syriza-Sinn F&eacute;in approach of saying to hell with everybody does not work.  It creates a lot of stress, uncertainty and, ultimately, more misery for Greek citizens.

I happened to be at three European Council meetings where Prime Minister Tsipras spoke to the assembled leaders of both the eurozone and the European Union and in each case he made it clear that Greece did not want to default, that it would not default, that Greece wanted to remain a member of the eurozone, and that Greece wanted to do the things that are necessary to get its economy and its country back on an even track.  At the special meeting of the eurozone on the Monday he repeated many of those objectives.  He said clearly that the Greek Government accepted the objectives and principles set down by the institutions in so far as the path forward was concerned.  He made the point that he was able to achieve social consent.  He made a particular point about the tourism industry at all of those meetings in terms of how important and fundamental it was and is to the Greek economy.  He also made a point about the number of islands off the mainland, the distances involved and the difficulties in so far as VAT is concerned, with particular reference to the tourism and hospitality sector.  My comments in respect of VAT, PRSI and income tax were in that context, that our programme was not anti-growth or against the opportunity to create jobs and employment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin said he himself was a member of a government that went about this business.  That Government came to the House and said the programme negotiated with the troika was irreversible, unchangeable and could not be changed in any fact or area.  That is the legacy he left.

However, in our experience of the British security and intelligence systems, the ways in which secrecy can be abused, decisions and actions taken are at odds with democratic norms and values and adversely impact on the lives of citizens are now a part of our history.  I am not suggesting that could happen here, although when there is no accountability, there is the potential for such abuses to occur.  The British state infamously collaborated in the killing of hundreds of citizens, including in this state.  Its intelligence agencies collected and I have no doubt still collect millions of pieces of information on ordinary citizens across the island.  The British are not alone in this.  The United States was caught spying on most European states, which are its allies.  It was interesting to see that at the beginning of this month the US Senate passed a Bill to end bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records.  That was the consequence of the courageous actions of Edward Snowden, the US National Security Agency whistleblower.  His information confirmed that the US Government, without obtaining court warrants, had routinely collected telephone logs of tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of Americans who had no link whatsoever with subversion or violent groups. <\/p>  <p>  I raise these matters as an illustration of the danger that secret intelligence gathering practices can lead to illegality and human rights abuses.

Does the national security committee have any oversight role in the gathering of information and surveillance by the various intelligence-led sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the director of military intelligence?  Does it have any responsibility for decisions over what citizens could or should be targets of surveillance?  I do not know if this is true but it was reported ten years ago that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requested clearance to examine 10,000 telephone records of citizens.  Does the national security committee have a role in this?  Does it have to clear it and does it have any oversight over such actions?  What is the relationship of the national security committee with other intelligence agencies?

Ireland cannot consider itself immune from international terrorist threats and the level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in light of changes that take place in the current international climate.  There is no specific information on any threat to this country from international terrorism but we will focus on any other measures that can be taken to prevent an attack such as that in Tunisia.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities and the Garda Commissioner will work very closely with their international security and intelligence counterparts in counteracting any threat and they take appropriate operational measures where needed.  I do not have access to the detail of what those operational measures might be.  The activities of a small number of people based in Ireland and whose behaviour may be of concern in this regard will continue to be monitored closely and regularly.  This country also contributes actively to the actions that have been brought forward at EU level by the justice and home affairs Ministers to support the work of member states in counteracting the threat from terrorism, and these include actions to address the foreign fighter phenomenon and to combat violent radicalisation.  We also engage with international partners, including the United States, the Council of Europe and the United Nations, in efforts to combat ongoing terrorism and radicalisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted here on 8 June and further strengthens Ireland's laws to address the international terrorist phenomenon.  It contains three offences, namely, public provocation to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences carry penalties of ten years' imprisonment on conviction and on indictment and are especially pertinent to the nature of the current challenges presented by international terrorism given that there is clear evidence across Europe of people who are engaged in the radicalisation of others.  I listened to the father of the person who was the main perpetrator of the murders on the beaches in Tunisia and there seemed to have been a total change in the young man's nature and personality.  The legislation here complements the State's existing body of counterterrorism law, including the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has given priority to this issue.  During Ireland's recent Presidency of the Council of the European Union, we were successful in gaining the agreement of member states to review the EU strategy for counter-radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.  Work is continuing on this matter at various levels within the European Union and Ireland participates in that.  One of the issues that needs to be addressed in that review is how best to manage the phenomenon known as foreign fighters.  Ireland is also a member of a group of like-minded states established during the Irish Presidency to develop a response to this issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has met her EU colleagues with a view to building momentum behind a range of efforts to resolve this particular issue.  In 2014, we co-sponsored the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2198, which set out a series of measures to address the growing problem of international terrorism, including the foreign fighter phenomenon and international radicalisation.  Earlier this year, we also participated actively in the negotiation of an additional protocol to the Council of Europe's Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism in 2005 which is aimed at countering foreign fighters.<\/p>  <p>  This country is very much in tune with the threat, and the committee, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, engages regularly with its members.  Garda&iacute; regularly monitor the threat and take whatever operational measures they deem appropriate to deal with any indication that something is about to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000023#V00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1435679700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>In light of the horrific and brutal murders in Tunisia, there clearly is a need for the national security committee to meet quite regularly because surveillance works.  There is another side to the equation and while I understand the balance between surveillance and privacy rights for citizens, the most fundamental obligation of Government is to protect its citizens and that means proper surveillance and proper intelligence.  I question whether we have the capacity we require in light of the threats that are emerging through ISIS and radical Islamic fundamentalists.  This is an attack on our civilisation such as we have not quite had before in its widespread and random nature.  It can happen in any city in the world, from Sydney to Paris to a beach in Tunisia.  Unfortunately, one of the prices citizens have to pay to enhance our protection is to have robust surveillance and intelligence.  If people have alternatives to this I would like to hear them.<\/p>  <p>  We rely a lot on international intelligence and we need to take stock of our own internal capacity to determine how safe Ireland is from an ISIS attack.  That is a significant point which I do not make in any accusative or political way.  It is an obvious question to ask, given the absolutely random way in which these people go about their horrid deeds.  There is no great sophistication in a young man walking along a beach with a Kalashnikov rifle and just mowing down innocent people who are on holiday.<\/p><p>That creates a whole new security surveillance-intelligence paradigm the likes of which we have never really had to deal with.  That is the point I am making to the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> I remember the national security meetings and their regularity, particularly in the context of this particular threat which can happen at any time, anywhere and with the most random of measures.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, I saw how surveillance and intelligence worked.  I know the number of times I was briefed by security forces.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be briefed on dissident threats, for example, and that criminals operating in the North with bombs that were twice the size of the one in Omagh have been intercepted at the 11th hour.  God knows what would have happened if those bombs and bombing missions were not thwarted at the 11th hour by the security forces and the Garda working with the PSNI.<\/p> <p> There is a balance to be struck.  I do not believe in mass targeting of citizens' information or anything like that.  One needs intelligent intelligence, if one likes, and targeted approaches.  However, surveillance and intelligence protects lives.  In Northern Ireland, down through the years, there were some appalling acts of counter-intelligence, collusion and all of that.  On the other hand, there was intelligence that saved lives.  Right up to the present day, Northern Ireland intelligence and surveillance saves lives.<\/p> <p> The ISIS threat is the most serious we have encountered in recent times.  I do not have all the answers to it but the sheer random nature of it necessitates more frequent meetings of the National Security Committee and, perhaps, an assessment of our capacity to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000023#V00500","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435680300,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I do not think anyone would disagree with the comments of Deputy Martin.  Intelligence and information is critical to saving lives and preventing incidents of terrorism or extremism which is why, when speaking to the British Prime Minister this morning, I said to him that we will co-operate with the British Government in respect of interception of communications where that applies, but that it would be within the confines of the law.  Deputy Martin is well aware of the close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and the evidence that it has prevented incidents on both sides of the Border.  The level of co-operation remains very high and there is clearly a level of sharing of intelligence, which I know Deputy Martin supports.  The Garda have met their counterparts at a European level and are very conscious of this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Do we hear remarks about this country being used as a hub for transit to other locations of these so-called foreign fighters?  There is no evidence that Ireland is a transit hub for extremists.  As a small number of people who belong to a particular group are here, if there are any indications in their activities of involvement or an inclination in that regard, they are closely monitored by the Garda.  It is important to say that the vast majority of those religious groups who are here want to go about their lives in the ordinary way and practise their genuine religious beliefs.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have any evidence, given to the committee, of this country being used as a hub for terrorist activities.  The current approach by the EU, in which we participate, is focused on four areas: enhanced information sharing between police and intelligence services, which is the point Deputy Martin raised; dealing with online radicalisation; engagement with third states used by foreign fighters to access Syria and Iraq, notably in this case Turkey; and improved controls to counteract illicit firearms.  The European internal security strategy concentrates on a number of priority areas in tackling terrorism.  They include the establishment of a European counter-terrorism centre within EUROPOL; disrupting organised crime, which included supporting legislation to make it more difficult for criminals to abuse financial systems; and fighting cybercrime, focusing on identifying high risk areas here and working with the private sector to identify vulnerabilities and close loopholes and the provision of specialised training.  In this context the Government recently approved the national cyber-security strategy, which will be led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The priority areas also include dealing with online radicalisation, including launching an EU level forum with the IT companies to bring them into contact with civil law, civil society and law enforcement agencies with a view to countering online extremist propaganda.  The authorities here have met social media companies and organisations with a view to looking at that issue.  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and members of the Garda travelled and met the major social media companies to identify ways the public and the private sector can work to address this particular matter.  It is an issue of concern to everyone.  From the Garda point of view and the committee's point of view, this is a high level priority and continues to be monitored very closely. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000024#W00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","time":1435680300,"counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000024#W00300"},{"type":"question","time":1435680300,"counter":228,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[5475\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000024#W00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the position regarding the letter he mentioned during the Order of Business on 28 January 2015 that he received from a legal firm in respect of the terms of reference on the commission of inquiry to be established following the Guerin report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1435680300,"counter":229,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[15224\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000024#W00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the correspondence he received on 8 December 2014, referred to during the Order of Business on 28 January 2015, from a legal firm (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1435680300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.

I have never before come across a situation where a commission of inquiry was established without a debate.  The Members who are being asked to have an input should be asked to have an input.  I realise that under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the Government takes the initiation role in terms of establishing the inquiry and so on.

If a Deputy is asked to vote on something he should have an opportunity to speak on that or have an opinion on it, particularly on a matter that has already exercised the House for a considerable time previously, for example, all the issues relating to the establishment of the commission of inquiry and the Guerin report.

For example, no similar concerns were raised about <i>sub judice<\/i>when the Fianna F&aacute;il leader named Padraic Wilson, a private citizen and a respondent at that time in legal proceedings.  He was named in this Chamber.<\/p><p>This brings us to the nub of the question.  On 28 January, in the midst of the row over the Ceann Comhairle's ruling to block a debate on the commission's terms of reference, the Taoiseach referenced receipt of a letter from the law firm Gallagher Shatter Solicitors, which was acting for the former Minister.  In his letter, an Teachta D&aacute;la Shatter attempts to influence the terms of reference of the commission of investigation by specifically excluding his name from it.  He also claimed that the tabling of the motion and the subsequent debate would encroach upon the courts.  This position is at odds with his attitude in May 2014 when he resigned.  At the time he wrote that it was appropriate that these matters be the subject of a statutory inquiry.  He also said he was resigning because he did not want to distract from the role of the Government or create any difficulties for Fine Gael and the Labour Party.<\/p><p>In the course of lengthy debates in the D&aacute;il, we eventually persuaded a reluctant Taoiseach in February to produce the details of the correspondence that surrounded this case, including the fact that an Teachta D&aacute;la Shatter had written to him as far back as last September.  As a consequence, many in the D&aacute;il, including myself, and others outside of the D&aacute;il were left with the clear belief that the Taoiseach engaged in a series of diversions to avoid giving a full, accurate and timely account to the D&aacute;il on ongoing and extensive correspondence between him and an Teachta D&aacute;la Shatter.<\/p><p>It also emerged that included in a letter to an Teachta D&aacute;la Shatter sent on behalf of the Taoiseach on 21 November was a copy of the draft order with the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.  This was done a month before the draft order was presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Was it appropriate that a Fine Gael backbencher who played a central role in the issues under investigation should be given the draft terms of reference which, as it transpired, the D&aacute;il was subsequently unable to debate?  Another letter to Deputy Alan Shatter dated 17 December stated that Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins would be the sole member of the commission of investigation.  Once again, this information was provided for an Teachta D&aacute;la Alan Shatter before it was presented to the D&aacute;il or made public.  Is this normal practice?  Is it not evidence of the frequently-dismissive approach that the Taoiseach and the Government take to the D&aacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000025#X00400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1435680900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>No, I do not agree.

Most recently, I met Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Archbishop Michael Jackson when I officially opened a new campus development at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  In addition, I meet representatives of religious and other philosophical bodies through a formal structured dialogue process, which provides a channel for consultation and communication between the State and such bodies on matters of mutual concern.  These meetings take place at both ministerial and official levels, and meetings may be sought by either side on the basis of a proposed agenda, agreed in advance of the meeting.

The discussion with Atheist Ireland focused on the philosophy and aims of the organisation, a secular constitution, laws and practices, matters concerning the education system, and the constitutional and human rights of atheists in Ireland.

He outlined a series of meetings he had with the Humanist Association of Ireland, Atheist Ireland and the Catholic Church and Church of Ireland.  Let me move quickly to the issue concerning our schools, and school patronage in particular.  The Taoiseach will recall that in the early days of Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn's time as Minister for Education and Skills, he said he wanted 50% of schools to change patronage or to change to other models during the lifetime of the Government.  I remember questioning the Taoiseach at the time and he deferred to the Minister.  There are approximately 3,000 primary schools.  If 50% were to change status, it would have involved approximately 1,500 schools.  Out of the more than 1,500 primary schools that were supposed to have been involved, exactly five changed status and another four are to change status in September.  If ever there was a case of spin trumping substance, this is one.  The Taoiseach must accept that.<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said many things in this day but we all remember the famous comment about signing on the steps of Trinity College the dotted line of an agreement that there would be no increase in third level fees.  Within months, he was increasing them.  That happened so I do not know why the Minister for Foreign Affairs is shaking his head.  He cannot make these things go away.  There are photographs and so on.  It is a bit like the statement that the VAT never increased.  It appears we all only imagined that it actually increased.  It actually never did according to the Taoiseach.  I thank the Taoiseach for convincing me of the fact that we never had an increase in VAT.  Likewise, on this issue, much time was wasted and many fears were stoked up.  Very little actually happened in this area.  I would like the Taoiseach to comment on that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Islamic religious leaders, one of the issues that arises is that many Muslims are very concerned about what is happening.  After the Paris attacks, the German demonstrations, and so forth, a debate on Islam has been taking place in Europe.  It is completely unacceptable to try to blame Muslims in general for the actions of a tiny extremist minority, yet certain movements are trying to do that.  Did the Taoiseach discuss this with the leaders of the Muslim church in Ireland?  Does he agree that we need to ensure we stand united against attempts to blame an entire religion or group for the action of extremists?<\/p>  <p>  As we said earlier, given the murders in Tunisia and elsewhere, we need to increase vigilance against extremist violence.  In the Taoiseach's discussions with the leaders, did he touch on those subjects and how we can prevent a fundamentalist minority entrenching itself and developing here?  How can we guard against intolerance and the emergence of generally extreme manifestations of religions, particularly Islam?<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach outline why he decided not to proceed with the blasphemy referendum?  I never heard a proper explanation as to why he decided not to proceed with it.  Most people were nonplussed or could not understand why we were having a referendum on the age at which one could become President.  No one saw that as a pressing, urgent matter of public interest.  The blasphemy referendum proposal had substance to it.  Why did the Taoiseach not proceed with it, especially because he was going forward with two referenda, one on marriage equality and the other on the age of the President?  One could argue that a blasphemy referendum or, alternatively, a referendum on the nomination process concerning how one becomes President were more pressing.  On blasphemy, commitments had been given.  I would like an explanation as to why the Taoiseach did not proceed with that referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000026#Y01600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1435681500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Dermot Ahern, blocked it in the early stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000026#Y01700","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1435681500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>The Government made a commitment and the Constitutional Convention was in favour of one.

I believe it is overdoing it in this regard.  One cannot just excise out of existence Christian beliefs and the need for reflection.  I would have believed that what now stands for the Angelus, the moment of reflection before the \"Six One News\", is not exactly injurious or offensive to anyone.  One runs the risk of becoming offensive and intolerant of the various manifestations of spirituality and religion in the country.  There is a need for balance in the public debate.  I would accept the bona fides expressed in the debate on the more substantive issues but when the debate focuses on such micro elements, it offends many people.<\/p>  <p>  On the fundamental issue of school patronage, resources comprise the key issue in primary schools today.<\/p><p>Sometimes this does not get said enough.  I visit many primary schools - Educate Together, Catholic and Church of Ireland schools.  It needs to be said that there are people of many faiths and none on the campuses of denominational schools which cater for them in a very harmonious and effective way.  There are many different nationalities and people of different religions and none in many of our primary schools who get along fine.  We need to acknowledge that in terms of the development of primary and secondary school settings.  Critical mass is important.  We are now constructing three or four schools in very close proximity to each other and that also needs to be thought through as well in terms of the proper use of resources, a bit of common sense and an understanding of where various people are coming from.  Resources at primary level are a major issue in terms of the capitation grant, pupil-teacher ratio and a range of other supports that have been taken from primary schools in recent times.  Many teachers and principals are fed up with the phoney debate on patronage entered into by the previous Minister for Education and Skills.  It is a load of bluster and spin with no substance behind it yet it distracts from core issues facing teachers.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach met with the Jewish congregation.  My understanding is that it also feels targeted and vulnerable in respect of what is happening globally.  We need to pay particular attention to its faith and schools attended by significant numbers of the Jewish congregation and acknowledge and address the community's vulnerability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000026#Y02000","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435682100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin raised a number of important issues.

I'm confused by all the explanations that are out there.  Therefore, I might vote or I might not vote.\"  In hindsight, it was overly enthusiastic to consider holding half a dozen referenda on the same day called Constitution Day.  For that reason, we made a choice.  The Convention on the Constitution said that we should have referendums in certain areas.  We dealt with six referenda during the lifetime of this Government on Oireachtas committees; judges' remuneration; the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union; children's rights; the abolition of the Seanad, the setting up of the Court of Appeal; and the two most recent referenda.

We held two referenda, one of which was accepted and the other not accepted.  Obviously, blasphemy is one for the next Government to consider.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, a couple of years back.  He was the first person to mention the question of patronage and the fact that the Catholic Church had so many schools that it wished to divest itself of a number of them.  He said that it would be more than appropriate for the Catholic Church to have schools that reflected its ethos.  The former Minister for Education and Skills recognises that a 50% transfer to other patrons will never be achieved within the period in question.  <\/p>  <p>  Rural schools are of great interest to an enormous number of people.  There has been a growth in the population in city areas and a corresponding reduction with smaller families, planning permission problems and a drop in the population in any event.  The Government made two changes recently.  Small schools form a critical part of the social infrastructure of rural Ireland, particularly isolated communities.  In recognition of that and in order to support the sustainability of small school communities, the Government decided that there should be a development of a voluntary protocol for amalgamation of the smallest schools that are close to each other with other schools of similar patronage and language of instruction.  It was to be completely voluntary.  The other policy consists of an improvement of the staffing schedule for the smallest schools.

Those improvements recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8 km from the nearest school of the same type.  That package of measures will provide rural communities, including those representing minority religions, with security about the future of their small schools, for which they are very grateful, recognising the essential social function small schools can play, particularly in isolated communities.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned a number of groups with which I met.  I met with the Islamic community.  We discussed the question of the law on blasphemy.  It referred to the great value placed on religion in Ireland and indicated the Islamic community's support for the protection afforded in Article 46.1 of the Constitution which provides for the offence of blasphemy.  I noted that the recommendation by the Convention on the Constitution that the offence of blasphemy be removed from the Constitution had been accepted by the Government.  It had already been decided that this referendum would not be held during the lifetime of this Government but if the people return the current Government to power after the next election, the referendum will go ahead or whatever Government is returned can make its own mind up on that.  If the question goes to a referendum, it will then be a matter for the people.<\/p>  <p>  We also discussed the question of establishing a sharia council.  By that, the Islamic community meant a council that would deal with issues of family law and domestic challenges.  It said it would benefit the community as it would save time and money for those who submit to its rulings instead of taking grievances to court.  An official council could provide clarity as to which imam to attend for guidance.  There are imams in different locations around the country.  I pointed out that the Islamic community did not need the State's blessing to establish a sharia council.  Freedom of religion provided for in the Constitution would permit its establishment.  This does not negate the fact that the laws of the State apply to all its citizens.  I drew a parallel with divorce and the Catholic Church whereby divorce is recognised by the laws of the State but not by the laws of the Church and this was a rule Catholics could choose to adhere to.  We discussed forced marriages, the wearing of the hijab and community and cultural aspects relating to the Islamic community.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin also mentioned Atheist Ireland.  It discussed a secular Constitution, laws and practices, a secular education system, the constitutional and human rights of atheists and the philosophy and aims of Atheist Ireland.  I met with the Jewish community which discussed the religious rights and practices of the community.  We also discussed anti-Semitism which was of great interest to the members present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000027#Z00600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1435682100,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has made it clear that he will not act on the recommendation of the sixth report of the Convention on the Constitution, although the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, told the D&aacute;il that this recommendation was accepted and that a referendum would be held to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  The law defines blasphemy as publishing or saying something that is grossly abusive or insulting in respect of matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion.<\/p><p>There is an exception where literary, artistic or academic merit can be proved.  This, arguably, might not be such a huge issue, given that no one has been convicted of blasphemy in Ireland since 1855.  However, the acts of violence by ISIS, the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, the attack in North Carolina, the huge atrocities committed in north Africa and which are ongoing in parts of the Middle East and the recent attack in Tunisia in which three Irish citizens and 38 other folks were slaughtered all underline the role fundamentalism, political sectarianism and race hatred continue to play in the world.  The State has a ban on incitement to hatred, including on religious grounds, but the removal of the blasphemy clause from the Constitution would send a very powerful message across the world that the Irish people were opposed to sectarianism, which is still prevalent in Irish society today, in particular, in the North, as well as to intolerance, injustice and racial hatred.<\/p> <p> It is good that the Taoiseach has met religious leaders.  When we last discussed this issue in January, he said he was going to meet representatives of the Islamic faith.  It is also good that he met Atheist Ireland and Jewish religious leaders, although, of course, these meetings were separate and unrelated.  Having a structure and a strategy for the Taoiseach's meetings with religious leaders and others would be very helpful at this time because our focus has to be on strengthening pluralist values, building on the republican and democratic values of citizenship, equality and inclusivity.  Lest we be too pious about all of this, there are lots of reminders of religious fundamentalism, including Catholic fundamentalism, in the scandals of the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries and the mistreatment of women.  The Government established a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters.  The commission is to provide a full and proper account of what happened to vulnerable women, babies and children in these homes.  Does the Taoiseach have any information on the progress of the commission and when its report is to be published?  I previously asked but do not recall the Taoiseach answering if he had met any of the faith communities since the \"Yes\" vote in the marriage equality referendum and if he would make a statement on the matter.  If he  has answered that question, I stand corrected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000027#Z00700","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435682700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I also wish to ask about I believe the Taoiseach's one and only meeting with Atheist Ireland.  Will he recognise that we now live in a very diverse society, a society in which there are many religions and faiths but also people of no faith?  When will this fact be reflected by the Government and the State?  We recently had a fantastic referendum result which provided for affirmation of LGBTQ rights, but it was much more than that.  It was a statement of intent by the majority of people in the country that they wanted a tolerant and diverse society and that they also believed there should be a separation of Church and State.  I firmly believe this.  Odinary people are way ahead of the political establishment in these matters.  In health, education and other aspects of life we need to start deconstructing the symbiotic relationship between Church and State.  Do we really need to have an archbishop sitting on the board of the National Maternity Hospital?  What gynaecological expertise does he have?  In the education sector is it acceptable - the United Nations does not think it is - that atheists like me who, according to the census, actually make up about 8% of the population, as well as people of minority faiths, have nowhere to send their children to school in most areas?  The Catholic Church controls 90% of primary schools, while I think the Church of Ireland controls about 6%, which means that there are really very few alternatives for those living in most locations.  We heard a lot of platitudes about divesting schools and starting to reflect the demand for more diversity, but it did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  I understand Atheist Ireland raised three issues with the Taoiseach.  The first was to recognise that a large number of issues remained to be addressed.  The group was concerned, in particular, about the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which is going through the Oireachtas, and section 37, an issue which the House has debated.  The Labour Party's Bill on that issue in the Seanad still allows for discrimination against atheist teachers, for example.  A Catholic primary school would be allowed to not employ somebody who did not believe and it seems that this would be okay.  That is not acceptable.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee has told Ireland to stop breaching the human rights of minorities and atheists.  It does not matter if the majority are Catholics; the rights of others have to be respected also.  The third issue was the case of Louise O'Keeffe in the European Court of Justice where it had to be proved that the State was responsible for protecting her rights.  The State has not as yet owned up to this.  <\/p>  <p>  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il referred to the Angelus.  We need to start separating civil society from a person's private religious faith.  For instance, in this House each morning when it begins its business, we have a prayer, but it is a Catholic prayer.  As a lot of people are not Catholics, why do we do this?  We need to separate the civic space from the religious space.  I am fully in favour of protecting people's religious rights to worship but not of inflicting it on the rest of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000028#AA00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1435682700,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Deputy Gerry Adams raised the question of blasphemy.  The Government made a decision that there should be a referendum on the issue.  I am glad to note the support of the Opposition parties, which is different from what applied in the past.  The issue can be carried forward by way of agreement.  Whatever Government the people select in the future can decide to follow through on that decision and hold a referendum on the issue.  There is a structure to the dialogue and, as I said in my opening remarks, the agenda can be determined by either side.  Issues that might be of importance to any of the religious groups or institutions may be raised, if they wish to do so.  I found the discussions with the different groups exceptionally interesting in the issues they raised.  For instance, the Humanist Association stressed the importance of removing the requirement for incoming Presidents, judges and members of the Council of State to make a religious declaration on taking office.  It explained that a humanist could not hold any one of the positions mentioned.  It referred to the number of instances in the education system where parents said they had their children baptised solely for the purpose of obtaining a baptismal certificate to increase their chances of securing school places.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, pointed to all of these matters in the move towards having a more disparate patronage of schools.  At the meeting the Minister for Education and Skills explained that the Equal Status Acts, 2000 and 2004, allowed for schools to be selective in their admissions policies when they were oversubscribed.  The requirement to produce a baptismal certificate was one of the criteria that schools could adapt.<\/p><p>When I met Atheist Ireland, it referred to Article 42 of the Constitution, which states:<blockquote>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.<\/blockquote>Atheist Ireland stated that, in accordance with the wording of Article 42, atheists sought the moral as opposed to the religious education of their children.  In its view, the moral aspect of the obligation contained in the provision was not being fulfilled by the State.  It pointed out that religious and moral education was referred to and that the perceived failure to vindicate the moral aspect constituted discrimination.  It made that point forcefully.  <\/p><p>Deputy Ruth Coppinger made a point about minority faiths.<\/p><p>This was part of the process that the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, had put in place to deal with these issues which became very real to me when they pointed out what they have to do every day in respect of their children.  Obviously, there is an issue for further discussion here.  I take the Deputy's point about the minority faiths.<\/p> <p> I refer briefly to the issue of mother and baby homes that was raised.  The commission was established on 19 February under section 32 of the Commissions of Investigation Act and it is working away.  The terms of reference include clarifying that the intended focus is on single women and children being accommodated for the purpose of receiving extended and supervised maternity and infant care services in mother and baby homes; defining the specific issues of public concern as discrete matters to be investigated; and specifying a list of mother and baby homes; and defining the relevant period as being from 1922 to 1998, while allowing the commission to reduce the relevant period in respect of any component part or institution if it considers it appropriate to do so.<\/p> <p> The two modules under way are scheduled to be completed by August 2016 and the commission will complete its final report not later than February 2018.  Deputies will appreciate that the range of years from 1922 to 1998 is enormous and the timescale to do that is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000028#AA00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435683300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1435683300,"counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000029#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1435683300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 5, Public Transport Bill 2015 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 32 - statements on the forthcoming White Paper on defence, and the order shall not resume thereafter.<\/p><p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 9 p.m. and shall adjourn not later than 11 p.m.; and (2) the proceedings on No. 32 shall be taken not later than 9 p.m. and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, and such Members may share their time; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, and such Members may share their time; and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply, which shall not exceed five minutes.

What the Government is proposing represents a further illustration of the sheer contempt it has for the D&aacute;il.  The arrangements for the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are entirely unacceptable.  Our party Whip wrote to the Ceann Comhairle's office some days ago pointing out that we had significant issues with the Government's approach to the Report Stage amendments being introduced to the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  In particular, the amendments inserting new sections 43 to 47, inclusive, into the Bill are of concern to our party.  These involve the insertion into the Bill of amendments to the Water Services Acts 2013 and 2014, regarding payment of water charges, the water conservation grant database and other amendments related to the operation if Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore our Whip raised Standing Orders 131 and 136.  Standing Order 131 allows only amendments that are not in conflict with the principles of the Bill and are relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  The series of amendments now introduced by the Government on Report Stage are totally out of sync with the spirit of the Bill as passed on Second Stage.  Standing Order 136 provides that no new section or other amendment may be proposed which creates a charge on the public revenue or upon the people.  The Government amendment clearly creates a charge on the people in setting out provision for the extraction of water charges on property occupiers.  Standing Order 141 sets out that where Bills are to be substantially amended on Committee or Report Stage, an explanatory memorandum should be provided.  At the date of that letter, no such memorandum had been provided despite the substantial amendments from the Government side.<\/p>  <p>  In essence it seems the water issue is regarded as toxic.  We have had this since the very beginning of Irish Water.  The Government has rammed through every piece of legislation related to Irish Water.  The manner in which it has managed it and ordered the House to debate Irish Water has caused D&aacute;il walkouts.  Here at the 11th hour we are back to the usual end-of-term jackboot tactics the Government has deployed in recent years, ramming material that may be politically sensitive through the House without adequate debate.  The amendments relating to Irish Water are significant, may constitute a Bill in their own right and should not be smuggled in under a wider miscellaneous provisions Bill with a view to trying to avoid a difficult political debate on water charges and the operation of Irish Water.  That seems to be the Government's agenda.<\/p>  <p>  One hour has been proposed for the debate on the recommittal.  Technically the Government may be in conformity with the Standing Orders of the House, but in substance and in the spirit of how we operate, this is a very sneaky and underhand way to deal with substantive items pertaining to water charges at the 11th hour as this session comes to an end.  It is not appropriate to ram it through in an hour tomorrow.  I believe the entire debate should go back to full Second Stage, given the nature of the amendments the Government has tabled on Report Stage relating to entitlements to the conservation grant and how it is to operate and other matters pertaining to the extraction of water charges and so on.<\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable and disgraceful behaviour by the Government, which is yet again treating this House with absolute contempt and no regard for democracy.  There have been no reforms, no change to how the D&aacute;il does its business and certainly no democratic revolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000029#BB00700","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1435683300,"counter":284,"content":"<p>On Friday last I asked that a new explanatory memorandum be prepared.

We have a series of motions that are designed to facilitate adding the attachment of water charges and related matters to legislation that has nothing to do with the issue of water.  It seeks to introduce attachment orders to a house, to impose an obligation on landlords to supply tenants' details to Irish Water and to make tenants liable for unpaid water charges.  All of this deserves to be dealt with in separate legislation, allowing for pre-legislative debate with the stakeholders, a Second Stage debate, a full Committee hearing and Report Stage.  Instead the Government is seeking to limit any discussion to a one-hour Committee debate.  It is proposing to bypass all the mechanisms for proper democratic oversight.<\/p>  <p>  We know the Government can ram it through.  It can muster the backbenchers and they will vote whatever way they are whipped to vote, but it is not good enough.

There are important aspects to what is being proposed that require consideration by a committee.  For example, there is no provision to deal with the threat to deduct charges from tenants' deposits, nor is there provision, which was threatened, to take water charges from the incomes of ordinary people.  There are, however, important provisions in the Bill which an attempt to scare tenants, a very vulnerable group in our society, into paying water charges, threaten them with eviction and shift more than &euro;500 million from the property tax which people have paid at huge sacrifice into a fund for Irish Water.  All of these matters need much more examination.  What the Taoiseach has proposed is totally undemocratic.  It is one of the most hated austerity measures and the Taoiseach is attempting to avoid a Second Stage debate by guillotining the debate in a one-hour discussion tomorrow.  It is disgraceful and a continuation of the way the Government has treated people from the start on the issue of water charges.

I object to the idea the Government would only allow an hour for the discussion of amendments that have been brought in for the first time.

It is treating the House in farcical manner to be going about one's business this way.  I cannot understand why from the outset everything to do with Irish Water has been rammed through the House, from 2012 onwards and without debate.  It ends up causing the Government more difficulty and trouble than if it had gone about it in a more transparent, open and up-front manner.  Essentially, very serious issues to do with Irish Water and the extraction of water charges are being smuggled through on Report Stage of an Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill tomorrow in about an hour, and that is essentially what is being put before the House.

This report would seem to justify our worries in that regard.  The survey carried out by the Simon Community found, startlingly, that seven out of eight properties available for rent are priced beyond the reach of those in receipt of rent support.  In the case of single people, 99 out of 100 properties are beyond the reach of those in receipt of rent support.  In the case of a couple, 98 out of 100 properties are beyond the reach of those in receipt of rent support.  In the case of a couple with two children, 97 out of 100 properties are simply beyond their reach.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is aware, we have a very severe housing crisis which has given rise to a situation where 3,143 people are living in emergency accommodation, including almost 1,200 children.  Unfortunately, that does not tell the whole story.  It is only the tip of the iceberg.  Many people in this country for one reason or another, sometimes due to lack of space or other reasons, are not in emergency accommodation but are living with relatives in completely unsuitable conditions such as overcrowding or circumstances where babies or young children are living in the same household as very old people.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State will be busy from now to the election, but if he had time I would take him on a tour of my constituency.  I would take him into house after house in Limerick city where those conditions pertain.  In many of those houses he would find that patience is literally at breaking point.  The tensions involved in such situations are enormous.  It is difficult to imagine a worse possible environment in which to rear children, and many young children are in such unsuitable accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will be aware that since the previous cap was put on rent supplement, rents have increased by almost 20%, taking them beyond the reach of more and more people who are entitled to rent supplement.  In response to me in the House, the Minister for Social Protection did undertake to introduce an element of flexibility into the rent supplement scheme.<\/p><p>She circulated a letter to the managers of all labour exchanges throughout the country.  However, I have come across many cases in which flexibility is not being extended and people who are even slightly over the limit are not being accommodated.  It is totally at the discretion of the local social welfare officer.  Rents are increasing dramatically, for example, they increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2015, which means that more people will not be accommodated.  The further one is above the limit the less likely it is that flexibility can be applied, even if the social welfare officer is well disposed.  Will the Government re-examine this issue?  The ideal solution would be to increase rent supplement.  In the absence of this, will the Government re-examine the way flexibility is being applied in practice?  What is its position on the application of flexibility under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, under which more people are being accommodated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000033#FF00400","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435686300,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

More than 2,400 people are in receipt of the new housing assistance payment, HAP, administered by the local authorities.  Today's report from the Simon Community entitled, Locked out of the Market: The Gap Between Rent Supplement-HAP limits and Market Rents, shows the major problem in addressing homelessness is the lack of supply of suitable accommodation.  The provision of housing is a key priority for the Government and the implementation of the range of actions in the Construction 2020 strategy and the social housing strategy 2020 will support increased housing supply.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully acknowledge the difficulties persons renting or seeking to rent are experiencing, increasing rent limits will provide little in extra supply but will further fuel rental inflation, as outlined in the Department's recent review of rent limits.  The State is a significant player in the private rented sector, accounting for over one third of the market.  In response to the difficulties the Department is providing a case by case response to ensure access to housing, curtail rental inflation and ensure value for money.  Some 2,100 people or families have accessed rent limit increases.  The measures implemented provide for increased flexibility in assessing customers' individual accommodation needs through the national tenancy sustainment framework introduced earlier this year.  Under this approach, each tenant's circumstances are considered on an individual basis and rents are being increased above the rent limits, as appropriate.  This measure applies to both existing rent supplement recipients and new applicants to the scheme.  The Department continues to work with Threshold's tenancy sustainment service in urban areas, Dublin and Cork cities, where supply deficits are most acute.  Departmental officials are engaging with the relevant stakeholders on the extension of this arrangement to Galway in the coming weeks.  The Department has also undertaken a communication campaign to encourage people at risk to make contact with it or the Threshold tenancy protection service as early as possible in order to prevent an unnecessary episode of homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  The Department provides support for persons towards rent deposits under the exceptional needs payments, ENP, scheme.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  In 2015 to date, more than 1,300 payments have been provided towards rent deposits, at a cost of almost &euro;700,000.  We are constantly reviewing the issue, scrutinising what is happening around the country and ensuring officers in my Department are exercising flexibility.  If there are individual cases in which flexibility is not being exercised, the Deputy is welcome to bring them to my attention.  I am seeking to ensure the offices of my Department exercise discretion and assist people to avoid homelessness and get into accommodation, including in the types of case the Deputy pointed to in which people are not homeless but are living at home in difficult circumstances and need to move into private rented accommodation.  If the Deputy has specific examples in which the system is not working, I will be happy to work with him to try to resolve them.  The scheme is being operated in the Deputy's area and I can provide information on the number of times discretion has been used there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000034#GG00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1435686300,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his offer and intend to take him up on it.

The Minister is to bring proposals on rent certainty to the Cabinet before the end of the session.  The figures I mentioned refer to the 2,100 cases in which the cap was broken, of which more than 1,400 were in the Dublin area, reflecting the position in the rental market.  Neither of us intends to put money into landlords' pockets.  I am not certain, however, that the Deputy's proposal to increase the cap by 5% would create even one additional unit.  I have met local councillors from around the country and they have given me example after example of areas in which there is no accommodation available.  In such areas, even if I were to increase the cap by &euro;1,000, it would not generate even one additional unit.  There is an acute supply problem.

I also welcome the Minister.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is a very important organisation and the investigation into its work is carried out independently by HIQA which verifies its capacity to \"promote the welfare of children and protect those deemed to be at risk of harm\".  These children need a proactive service which acts decisively to assess and meet their needs in order to promote their safety and welfare.  When HIQA inspected the child protection services and the welfare of children in the Meath and Louth area, it found that, of the 27 standards assessed, the services met only one and that significant improvements were needed in the case of at least eight others.<\/p><p>That is entirely unacceptable.  Tusla is a well resourced organisation, with a working budget of more than &euro;600 million and over 4,000 staff.  In light of the poor outcome of the inspections, I ask the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to meet with Tusla urgently to address the issues arising.<\/p> <p> The inspection identified significant risks resulting from ineffective and unsafe information systems, inconsistent allocation of social workers to children on the child protection and notification system and inadequate and unsafe systems to review, monitor and manage waiting lists across the service.  According to a working document I have in my possession, HIQA is satisfied that an action plan is now in place but it found that while staff in the centre valued the safety of children and endeavoured to keep children safe and meet their needs, this was not always possible.  Aspects of the service were unsafe and although children's cases were prioritised for social worker intervention, this did not always ensure that children who were at greatest risk and had highest levels of need received a timely service.  The capacity of the service to meet the needs of all children was compromised by delays in allocating social workers.  I am particularly concerned by the finding that unsafe or ineffective systems were in place to assess and manage actual or potential risks to children from adults living in the community.  This meant risks to some children went unidentified and unmanaged.  I ask the Minister to clarify these matters because it is unacceptable to read such findings in this day and age, given the significant investment we have made in the care and welfare of children.<\/p> <p> There is no shortage of money or staff in Tusla.  Although the inspectors acknowledged the impact of limited resources, service managers did not always demonstrate the level of leadership required to deliver an effective service.  I was unhappy with answers I received to parliamentary questions on this issue, although I accept the Minister is not to blame because my questions were addressed by Tusla.  However, when I contacted Tusla to speak with an official in the section responsible for parliamentary questions I was told there was no such section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000034#GG00700","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435686900,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Dowd for raising the issue of Tusla's child protection and welfare services in the Louth-Meath area and I welcome the opportunity to address his concerns.  The inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reported concerns the standard of services being provided to children and families in the area.  This is a significant cause of concern to me, my staff and Tusla.  As Deputy O'Dowd pointed out, HIQA's findings are stark. This demonstrates the real importance of having an independent regulatory regime.  I assure the Deputy that of the 46 actions arising from significant risks, 22 have now been addressed and a further 24 will all be completed within dedicated time-frames.  Steps have been taken to ensure all children on the child protection notification system are allocated a social worker and improvements made to record keeping and data collection.  I was glad to see that HIQA found that all cases where children at immediate risk of harm at the point of referral were responded to in a timely manner, although I also noted that in some cases there were waiting periods for a dedicated social work service.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA was satisfied with the action plan to address the significant risks that were identified.  Half of the 101 actions required are now complete and HIQA and officials in my Department will monitor progress to ensure the improvements required are made.  Issues were highlighted regarding resources and staffing in counties Louth and Meath, and these are being addressed at national level as a matter of urgency.  Officials from my Department are already engaging with Tusla on resources for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016.  A submission on staffing and other resource issues is to be made in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  It has to be said that resources were not the only issue, however.  Other deficits in the local service arose from systems either not being implemented well or not implemented fully.  This led to concerns being expressed about the prioritisation of cases, the processing of complaints and management level information on cases.  Tusla notified me on the problems in the services prior to the publication of HIQA's report and it has taken direct ownership of action to improve the standards of service delivery.  The area is under a special programme of improvement led directly by the chief operations officer to address oversight and quality assurance.  A project social work team is in place to deal with the backlog and to assist with the implementation of national guidance and practice for the duration of the special programme.  The longer term issues and overall consistency of service delivery are being addressed by work at national level on policy and quality assurance.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the inspection findings were not all about deficiencies.  Many children were found to have benefitted from the service and there was evidence of good practice and excellent interagency collaboration.  Good practice with children and families was observed by inspectors, who also found that many neglect cases were well managed by social workers and children's lives had improved from social work and family support intervention.  The issue of completing initial assessments is dealt with in the report which states that the majority were of good quality, based on detailed information from key sources and including the clearly expressed views of children.  A minority of assessments were not of such good quality.  Difficulties were identified regarding signing off and closing assessments.  I understand Tusla is examining timeframes to better reflect the activity and dynamic nature of assessments overall.<\/p>  <p>  The issues identified by HIQA are of a concern to us all.  I have asked to be kept informed on progress.  A recurring theme overall in recent HIQA inspections is that social services are generally of a good standard but there are problems with the timeliness of the service.  This is a particular challenge as the demands on the service increase.  As a relatively recent national organisation, the challenge for Tusla is to provide a consistent response to identified need based on good quality assurance data and appropriate resources.  Reforms on how the service is organised nationally are taking effect.  I am committed to ensuring the reforms underpin a service that delivers a responsive and safe child welfare and protection service for the children and families of not only of counties Louth and Meath but the entire country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000035#HH00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435686900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>While I welcome the Minister's assurance, these are the most vulnerable children in our communities and the findings of the inspection are unacceptable.

It concerns the delay in ensuring that ambulance cover in west Roscommon and east Mayo is addressed.  The HSE has simply not delivered on ensuring that this ambulance blackspot is sorted out.  The OPW agreed a five-year lease with the national ambulance service to use the former Garda station in Loughglynn as a regional ambulance base.<\/p>  <p>  Some 18 months ago, Roscommon County Council gave planning permission to develop an ambulance base there.  However, it seems there has been very little progress on the project since then.  It is most disappointing because the HSE timeline for the operational start of the base was last summer.  In correspondence with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, I highlighted the situation regarding the ambulance service in Roscommon.  In that correspondence, I made clear the importance of ensuring that a sufficient level of ambulance cover is provided across the county.<\/p>  <p>  The ambulance base in Loughglynn is a vital facility for communities in west Roscommon and east Mayo.  It will significantly help to improve emergency response times in areas that heretofore have been ambulance blackspots.  The need to address the ambulance base in Loughglynn, and the issues concerning the county's ambulance service, must be an absolute priority for all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  So much work has been done in Roscommon Hospital.  An investment programme of &euro;20 million went into the county.  We have an air ambulance in the area which has saved lives and has been in operation for the last two years. <\/p>  <p>  I realise that the Minister can do some things, but not others.  I have heard from the ambulance service, however, that this is a HR situation.  These are situations that have been dealt with under the Haddington Road agreement.  People may blame politicians for what happens, but I am asking the ambulance service to address the situation immediately because lives will be lost if this matter, which was agreed in the Haddington Road agreement, is not brought to a head.  It should be done sooner rather than later.<\/p>  <p>  I am sick and tired of politicians making a political football out of this and playing with people's lives.  I am asking the people out there to do what they said they would do under the Haddington Road agreement.  I am asking the ambulance service and the Minister to intervene to ensure that whoever signed up to the Haddington Road agreement should now do what was agreed therein, otherwise lives will be at stake.<\/p>  <p>  This was never meant to be an ambulance base, as such.  It was meant to be a facility where ambulance drivers from Roscommon, Boyle or wherever would go to address an ambulance blackspot.  This has been agreed in backrooms during talks in which I had no say, and the Minister probably had no say in either.  It was agreed under the Haddington Road agreement where all the stakeholders were represented.  I am asking people out there to live up to their obligations.  They should not use this as a political football or put the blame back on politicians.  They have a responsibility for the lives of people in west Roscommon and east Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000036#JJ00400","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1435687500,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Feighan once again for raising this important issue in the House.  I am pleased to outline the current developments in relation to the Loughglynn ambulance station.<\/p>  <p>  First, I should explain that the national ambulance service, NAS, is changing and modernising its model of service delivery.  It is no longer considered appropriate for an ambulance station to provide services only for its local area.  For this reason, the national ambulance service is moving to dynamic deployment, where all resources in a region are deployed across that region as a fleet.  Moving to dynamic deployment was a specific recommendation in the HIQA report into ambulance services, which was published last year.<\/p>  <p>  Within the wider western region, the Roscommon area is supported by dynamic deployment from the north by Boyle and Carrick on Shannon, from the east by Longford and Mullingar, and from the south by Athlone.  A new 24\/7 capacity in Tuam and Mulranny stations is enhancing the coverage across north Galway, west Roscommon and Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  Also in support of dynamic deployment, Loughglynn is being developed as a base where ambulances can be located during shifts.  The base will provide facilities for staff and clinical storage.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that refurbishment of the ambulance station in Loughglynn is now complete and, indeed, has been for some time.  However, discussions are still ongoing with staff representative bodies about a number of staffing issues arising from the move to dynamic deployment in the region.  The NAS expects that the Loughglynn station will be operational following a resolution of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The national ambulance service is working to ensure high quality and timely emergency pre-hospital care, using all available resources as effectively and as efficiently as possible.  As for any modern health service, development and modernisation never ceases, as technology and clinical standards change and evolve.<\/p>  <p>  A significant and ongoing reform programme has been underway in recent years.  In 2015, an additional &euro;5.4 million has been provided to improve technology and clinical audit, and to address service gaps - in administration services - particularly in the west.  The single national control system, which is now almost fully operational, is improving our control and dispatch performance.<\/p>  <p>  The intermediate care service, ICS, transports patients between facilities and allows emergency vehicles and crews to focus on emergency calls only.  The ICS now carries over 80% of the non-emergency workload.<\/p>  <p>  We are also moving to more efficient on-duty rostering and developing a national rostering system.  Some 50 additional paramedics are being allocated in the west this year under this process.  Services in Roscommon have improved since 2011.  Roscommon town has three emergency ambulances during the day and two at night, as well as a 24\/7 rapid response vehicle, crewed by an advanced paramedic who can get there ahead of the ambulance and begin treatment on the scene.<\/p>  <p>  For Roscommon and the surrounding region, we also have the emergency aeromedical support service, EAS, based in Athlone.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, and I have confirmed that this service will now be extended.  The EAS takes very seriously ill or injured patients swiftly to the most appropriate hospital for their needs.  Over 1,000 missions have been completed since its inception in June 2012.  Counties Roscommon and Mayo have among the highest demand for EAS services.<\/p>  <p>  These are all significant achievements, but we intend to improve the service further.  The NAS expects to receive the independent capacity review very shortly, and this will help to determine current and future service needs.  Areas being examined include staff numbers and skill mix, as well as resources and deployment locations.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that these reforms will contribute to the ongoing improvements in our pre-hospital emergency care services, to the benefit of the people of Roscommon and the rest of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000036#JJ00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1435688100,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the NAS expects the Loughglynn ambulance station to be operational following the resolution of these issues.  It was stated on local radio by other politicians that this ambulance base would never open.  Why are people making those statements?  I know the elephant in the room from talking to the national ambulance service and it is the fact that people who work for the service signed up under the Haddington Road agreement but are still refusing to go out and man this station.  As a national politician it is my right to come into this House and state when something is wrong.  I have kept silent for far too long and my worry is that lives will be put at risk if this ambulance base is not opened soon.  I appreciate the fact the Minister and other people are doing everything possible but I am asking the people who signed the Haddington Road agreement to step up to the plate and deliver what they agreed.  If lives are lost this politician will not be taking responsibility - the responsibility will be back on those ambulance personnel who signed up to an agreement which they are obliged to carry out.  This has gone on for far too long and has been a political football for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely convinced that when this ambulance base opens in Loughglynn in west Roscommon, which was an ambulance blackspot, patients will have a quicker ambulance response time once again and will get the care they deserve.  I pay tribute again to the ambulance service personnel and the work they are doing on the ground, including the paramedics, the advanced paramedics and the air service.

From a political point of view I am very keen to have the station opened as soon as possible and the delay that has occurred to date is unacceptable.  It is, unfortunately, a common feature of our health service that we often see staff interests on the television or on the radio advocating on behalf of patients only to appear in rooms and offices a day or two later delaying the opening of new wards and other facilities, including a whole mental hospital in Cork, on the basis of staffing issues and industrial relations issues that should have been solved long before these facilities were completed.  This is a recurring theme and for decades now I have seen new facilities which need to be opened in the interests of patients but cannot be because of those staffing or industrial relations issues.  It is disappointing to see patients used as pawns by any side, whether management or unions, in such situations.  However, we do have mechanisms, including the LRC and the Labour Court, through which an intervention can occur if needs be so I encourage people to be bound by whatever recommendations come out of these bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000037#KK00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","time":1435688100,"counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000037#KK00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1435688100,"counter":365,"content":"<p>To the best of my knowledge, the Minister of State has done a fair job in distributing lottery money among the different counties but there is a serious issue in Wexford as to where the money goes after it arrives.  There is a lot of discontent that it does not seem to be a fair allocation at all times.  For example, in 2012 soccer got less than 5% of the money and in 2014 it got 11%.  According to an ESRI report on the social and economic value of sport in Ireland, soccer is the team sport with the highest level of participation in the country.  Another report on sport and recreational exercise among adults aged 16 and over in Wexford-Wicklow, commissioned by the Irish Sports Council in conjunction with the ESRI, showed that soccer was the most popular sporting activity among over-16s in these counties.  According to this report, 6.5% of all adults in this region would choose soccer compared to the combined uptake of Gaelic football and hurling, which weighs in at 4.9%.  With regards solely to male participation, 11.9% choose soccer as opposed to 8.1% for Gaelic football and hurling combined.<\/p>  <p>  All sport deserves more help than the Government can find money to give it.  Every sport has a huge benefit to society and makes a huge difference to making things work and helping young people to develop in a good, healthy fashion.  It is probably one of the best ways of all to fight obesity, which is growing at an astronomical rate in Ireland today.  However, the playing field should be level.  In Wexford we have an incredible soccer organisation.  Our junior league is the second biggest in the country and we have one of the biggest schoolboy sections outside of Dublin.  Women's soccer in Wexford is growing at an unprecedented rate and the Wexford women's youth team are the all-Ireland champions and will play in the champions' league this summer in Poland.  The amount of young boys and the number of women involved in the sport every weekend is astronomical and from September to May there are approximately 170 games each weekend, an incredible figure.  An allocation of less than 5% of the total money in 2012 and just 11% in 2014 compares poorly with how other sports have been dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a soccer background and many clubs have contacted me looking for fairness.  One club, Cloughbawn in Clonroche, which is a really deprived area, has applied every time but, despite having 18 teams, it has not received a penny.  The amount of work they put in at local level is incredible but they have failed to get help.  The Wexford league itself has looked for money on a few occasions but last year it was turned down because it did not submit a letter stating that it did not need planning permission for what it was doing, which was making pitches.  The Gaelic club in the town received more money than all the soccer clubs put together without even owning the site for which it received its grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000037#KK00400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1435688100,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The sports capital programme is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  This programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in every village, town and city in the country.  The facilities that have been funded range from the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.  The health benefits of participating in sport are well known and around 90% of SCP grantees report that they have been able to increase participation as a direct result of the facilities developed with these grants.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 round of the SCP is the third round of the programme since this Government came into office.  This reflects the importance that the Government places on sport and on providing opportunities for participation.  The fact that almost 1,600 applications were received under the 2015 round of the programme is evidence of the ongoing importance of the programme.  These applications are currently being assessed and I expect to announce allocations later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The programme assists voluntary and community organisations along with the national governing bodies of sport, local authorities, ETBs and schools to develop high quality, safe, well-designed, sustainable facilities in suitable locations and to provide equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation.  The programme also prioritises the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities with over 40% of the 2012 and 2014 SCP allocations going to designated disadvantaged areas.  I am very proud of that.  I have also given grants totalling &euro;3.225 million to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, primarily for the provision of basic facilities for boxing clubs, often located in the most disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p> Every application received under the 2015 sports application programme is being assessed against five criteria designed to give higher scores to applications that will increase participation, share facilities, are from designated disadvantaged areas, have not received significant funding in the past and are ready to be developed as soon as possible.  In deciding the final allocations to projects within each county, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I will give consideration to a number of factors, including the performance of each application during the assessment process, ensuring a geographical spread of projects within each county, ensuring a spread of projects between rural and urban areas within each county, and ensuring there is a spread of projects among different sports.<\/p> <p> In the lifetime of the Government &euro;88.5 million has been allocated in more than 1,700 separate grants to sporting groups and organisations under the sports capital programme and related special allocations, for example, equipment grants for national governing bodies of sport, local authority shovel-ready projects and the athletics tracks initiative.  Since taking office I have ensured every county gets its fair share of the sports capital programme funding available, based on its population, with an adjustment to give slightly more money to counties that had fared less well under previous rounds of the programme, thus making up for historical imbalances in funding.  I am more than happy with the distribution of the sports capital programme funding across different sports and the impact that these grants will have on participation during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000037#KK00500","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435688700,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, for whom I have two questions.

The people involved in soccer in Wexford are of the opinion that if I were not in the D&aacute;il, they would probably get more money.  If that is the case, it is probably not a good sign in terms of accountability, transparency and how things are done.

They think my presence here has not helped the situation.  Sadly, I suspect they may be right.  The figures speak for themselves, with less than a 5% allocation in 2012 and 11% in 2014 for the biggest sport in the county.  It does not look well.

It is a short Bill with just seven sections.  One section provides for the Short Title and collective citation, while there is one section each for four of the five Acts being amended and two sections providing for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  I will give an overview of the main amendments being proposed.  However, I emphasise that the amendments are technical amendments to existing legislation and do not involve any new regulatory policy.<\/p>  <p>  Section 1 relates to the public transport infrastructure functions of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The proposed amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 will ensure the NTA can develop and deliver public transport infrastructure such as bus rapid transit, BRT, in the event that it is decided to proceed with this project and others similar to it or other projects such as cycling schemes.  The amendments are required to address certain issues identified by legal advisers to the NTA as potentially precluding the NTA from providing such projects.  The proposed amendment ensures the NTA would have the necessary powers to deliver required public transport infrastructure but does not involve a commitment to the development of BRT itself.  Under the capital plan to 2020 the funding to support and improve bus services will be a key priority.  As well as ensuring a modern efficient fleet, it is essential the bus routes and supporting infrastructure facilitate the provision of attractive services.<\/p>  <p>  There are 16 bus corridors forming the core bus network within the Dublin region.  These priority bus corridors represent the key arteries of the bus system, with high frequency, multiple bus services using these routes.  As such they form the cornerstone of the overall bus network for the region.  Outside of the city centre, the overall length of these corridors amounts to about 174 km, or 347 km when each direction is considered separately.  Of these, less than one third, approximately 102 km, have dedicated bus lanes.  The remainder, approximately 70%, require buses to co-run with general traffic.  To improve the efficiency of the bus services on these routes and to improve journey time performance and overall competitiveness, it is important to address sequentially the bus lane deficits on these routes and provide continuous bus lanes, to the extent practicable, along these key corridors.  If funding were available over the next period, 30 km to 40 km of the required improvement works would be constructed each year.<\/p><p>The amendment will bring the provisions of section 27 in line with similar provisions under the Road Traffic Acts, as operated by local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it clarifies that the payment accompanying the notice cannot be accepted unless all the required information has been completed on the notice.<\/p> <p> Section 6 is essentially a technical amendment, correcting section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which deals with duties on the occurrence of an accident.  It was amended in 2014 to introduce new offences for hit-and-run incidents causing death or serious injury.  The Attorney General's office has since advised the Department that the amended version of the section contains an implicit contradiction.  The new hit-and-run provisions are indictable offences but they come under a section heading referring to summary offences.  The Attorney General's advice is that the intention of the law is clear in spite of the error, and the Director of Public Prosecutions is continuing to take prosecutions under this legislation.  However, it is also the view of the Attorney General's office that the error should be corrected at the earliest available opportunity, and that is what we are doing here.<\/p> <p> At the same time, we are rectifying an omission in the 2014 provisions.  When the new hit-and-run provisions were introduced, there should have been an associated amendment to state there would be a consequential disqualification for those who were convicted under the new provisions.  As this was not done at the time, we are doing it now through section 6(b) of the present Bill.<\/p> <p> I am giving consideration to the inclusion of two further amendments in the Bill, which I intend to introduce on Committee Stage.  At present, the NTA is required by virtue of the Roads Act 1993 to make an application for development consent in regard to public transport infrastructure, such as the development of the Sutton-Sandycove cycletrack scheme, S2S, to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as an environmental impact statement is required for such development.  However, I have been advised that the NTA is also required to seek planning permission from the relevant local authority.  The objective of the possible amendment will be to clarify that the NTA is required to engage in one statutory approval process for development in accordance with whatever legislation applies to the particular development, and not be subject to two different and parallel processes.  My Department is consulting both the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Office of the Attorney General on this proposed amendment.<\/p> <p> I also propose to amend the Bill on Committee Stage in respect of rail.  International rail travel is governed by a set of procedures and rules drawn up by the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail.  These rules are formally set out in a convention known as COTIF.  Ireland is one of only a small number of members of the organisation yet to fully ratify the convention.  This failure to ratify it has led to infringement proceedings being taken against us by the EU Commission.  As a result, and following advice from the Attorney General's office, I have decided that Ireland should expedite the ratification of the convention by means of primary legislation.  Irish Rail has been fully consulted on this matter and it should be noted that the enactment of legislation in this area will not have any significant practical impact on rail operators or rail passengers in the State.<\/p> <p> This is a technical Bill but, as is often the case with technical Bills, it is still an important one.  I commend it to the House and look forward to Deputies' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000038#LL03100","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435689300,"counter":398,"content":"<p>The Bill provides for a number of technical amendments to five existing statutes.  It does not involve any substantive regulatory changes and has no financial implications.  As the Minister knows, there are five main proposals in the Bill introducing miscellaneous technical amendments to current legislation.  While we welcome the technical amendments, we have some concerns relating to specific aspects of legislation and policy that the Bill touches upon.  The first concerns bus rapid transit, BRT, the second concerns the new taxi regulations and the third concerns the provisions relating to the hit-and-run offences.<\/p>  <p>  The first section is perhaps the most substantive in terms of regulatory changes.  It introduces an amendment to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to enable the NTA to develop road-based public transport infrastructure, in particular BRT.  It is understood that this is required to allow the NTA to develop BRT on public roads developed since the establishment of the NTA.   While Fianna F&aacute;il and I welcome the development of and public transport structure which has been sorely lacking in recent years, I would like the Minister to commit that bus rapid transport, which now seems to be the preferred option, especially the airport link, will not ultimately become a replacement for a more long-term solution.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il and I recognise the substantial requirement to invest in infrastructure and the necessity for the Government to carry out what is effectively a loaves-and-fishes miracle with moneys that are available but it is important that the Government have a long-term strategic investment plan.  As moneys become available, key priorities should be identified and the Government should not invest in the short term to meet a need that has long-term implications such that it would not be in a position to deal with the increased demand at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  While we welcome BRT as a short-term solution to link Dublin airport and the city rest of the country, it should be considered, at the very best, a distant second best to a heavy rail link to the airport.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate the cost of this.  At present, Dublin is one of the few capital cities in Europe without a rail link to its main airport.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes a railway link connecting Dublin Airport to the city centre and other urban centres is the only viable long-term solution providing for connectivity to this international gateway.  In the short-term, we believe the proposed BRT connection is an acceptable interim solution.  Despite the importance of transport infrastructure to the economy, the Government has persisted in its strategy of not putting in place the funding that is necessary, notwithstanding the difficulty in gaining access to the funding needed.  Funding announced in budget 2015 is only a tiny fraction of what is needed to make progress on many of the schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the choice between a heavy rail link and a light rail link to the airport, the Minister has indicated previously that he favours the light rail option, which consists of the Luas north via Glasnevin and Cabra.  While this option might have the benefit of providing a slightly less costly means of connecting the airport to north Dublin and the city centre, and has the incidental benefit of running through the Minister's constituency, it is questionable whether the light rail option will have enough capacity in the longer term to service such a large and growing population.  It is for that reason that I would be more interested in seeing the option of BRT in the short term.  If one opts for light rail, it is very hard to move to heavy rail later because of the investment already put in place.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are questions, recognised by the NTA, over the fact that the low-speed Luas will take quite a long time to travel from the city centre to Dublin Airport, never mind the 25 km to Swords.  It takes at least an hour currently to travel to Tallaght on the Luas red Line.  While it is very welcome in resolving a public transport need in the area, it is not an effective means of conveying people from end to end.  It is clear that the travel times between Swords and the airport or the city centre and the airport would not be acceptable and that the transport option would not compete effectively with existing modes, namely, the standard bus or taxi.  When the Minister is deciding on which rail link option to recommend, I hope he will consider both the limited capacity and slow journey times of his preferred light rail option by comparison with the capacity and journey times of the heavy rail option, such as the proposed metro north.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the Bill introduces technical amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 that were absent from the original Bill.  For instance, it defines a \"licence\" as \"a licence to drive a small public service vehicle for the carriage of persons for reward\".  As these are mainly technical amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act passed last year, we support these provisions.  The great majority of taxi drivers provide a very high-quality, professional service.  However, anything we can do to protect both the professional taxi drivers and the public they serve from unregulated elements in the industry should certainly be considered and implemented in legislation.  We need to do everything we can to ensure we have a properly regulated, professional taxi industry.  In particular, it should be seen as a full-time profession, not a go-to sector for part-time operators or fly-by-nights without proper qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  It should allow those who decide to take part in the profession to make a meaningful existence, carry on their business and raise a family the same as anyone else in a profession.  This Bill puts existing regulations on a statutory footing, ensuring that taxi licence applications must be accompanied by a written declaration stating that the applicant has not been convicted of an offence, that the vehicle is roadworthy, that penalty points have been recorded on the licence and that the driver holds a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>These are reasonable provisions with which the majority of taxi drivers are already in compliance.<\/p> <p> While competition in the taxi industry, as in any industry, is essential to ensure an efficient level of service for the consumer, the taxi business should be a full-time operation and taxi drivers should expect to be able to make a decent and honourable living from it.  The former Minister, Noel Dempsey, tried to address this matter through conditions dealing with the qualitative nature of the taxi business and putting certain regulations in place that make it difficult for those I would term \"fly-by-nights\" or part-time workers who cherry-pick the work at busy periods such as at weekends or when certain events are held.  The industry requires a coherent system of regulation to ensure the existence and maintenance of fair competition rather than free-for-all competition, which disadvantages professional taxi drivers.<\/p> <p> There are some areas where the new taxi regulations could be strengthened.  First, there may be a necessity to improve the complaints procedure and strengthen guidelines which recommend appropriate behaviour within taxis.  According to the latest National Transport Authority figures, almost 1,000 complaints were made against taxi drivers last year but the NTA took no further action in three out of every five cases.  I know some of these cases may be spurious because certain taxi drivers have indicated to me that there are others who seek to make spurious complaints because of the way the complaints procedure is structured.  If it is the case that the reason for taking no action in the majority of cases was due to a lack of substance on the part of the complaints, that is obviously a legitimate decision by the NTA.  However, if it is the case that such complaints are not being investigated due to lack of powers or inadequate level of resources on the part of the NTA, it is a potential issue the Minister might address in due course.  Driver behaviour was the most common complaint, making up nearly half the 952 complaints received in 2014.  Even if many of these complaints against driver behaviour are cases of mixed-up signals, such a large number of complaints suggests there is a potential problem here which may have to be addressed in new regulations.  I would like to see greater powers on the part of the NTA to investigate such complaints, notwithstanding the fact we must ensure compliant taxi drivers are not forced into the complaints procedure in respect of spurious complaints.  It would also be sensible to put in place an awareness campaign to publicise the fact that such a complaints procedure is in place in order that the genuine consumer who wishes to report poor behaviour by a taxi driver is aware of the procedure, can make complaints in an open and transparent way and can expect an outcome.  That is in the best interests of the consumer and the majority of taxi drivers.  In my experience, there are very high standards among taxi drivers in this country who are often more professional than their counterparts in other countries where I have used taxis.  A very small minority is not up to the standard one would expect.<\/p> <p> There is also scope to put in place new guidelines for appropriate behaviour, which can guide a complaints procedure and can be communicated as part of the licensing.  For example, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland have called for the NTA to require taxi drivers to complete training and commit to a code of conduct before a small public service vehicle, SPSV, licence is granted to cut down on instances of women feeling unsafe or threatened in taxis.  These are sensible proposals and could be incorporated into the taxi licensing process without much cost or effort.  Ultimately, such licensing provisions are to the benefit of the great majority of decent taxi drivers on whom they are unlikely to have any material impact.<\/p> <p> I also believe that the current regulations do not do much to offer adequate protection to taxi drivers.  The Taxi Regulation Act incorporates a strange information-sharing provision which has meant that information provided by taxis to the NTA in the register of licences for SPSVs has to be made publicly available.  Under these new provisions, all that is required to obtain the home address of a driver is the name or licence number of the driver, the taxi roof sign number or even the car registration and a fee of &euro;25.  It is difficult to see what valid public safety reason there is for taxi drivers to have their home addresses revealed to the public.  This seems like a classic case of overkill by the former Minister's regulations.  Such senseless open access to personal details and home addresses could potentially put in jeopardy both the privacy and the safety of drivers in jeopardy.<\/p> <p> While at the time of consultation, the former Minister and others paid lip service to the hard work and important public service of taxi drivers, little has been done since then to increase the physical safety of drivers in their cabs.  For instance, taxi representative organisations have repeatedly called for stricter sentencing for assaults on taxi drivers following a series of violent attacks, which seem to have increased in recent years.  This is probably understandable considering there is a belief that many taxi drivers carry large amounts of money.  It is not the case because many taxi drivers are struggling to make a living but to petty criminals who might be addicted to drugs, a relatively small amount of cash is a substantial gain.  In this context, taxi drivers are seen as a soft touch.  There is an issue around the use of credit cards in taxis.  I know that the NTA has consulted the industry and an effort is being made to find a point at which the use of a credit card kicks in.  That limit has yet to be defined but I would have thought anything above &euro;15 would be an appropriate point for a taxi driver to facilitate the use of a credit card.  I also believe that all taxis for hire at our airports should be in a position to accept credit cards.  Many tourists arriving in this State, particularly those from outside the eurozone or even the UK, might not have the local currency available and it is right and appropriate that any taxi plying its trade, especially at our international airports, must be in a position to accept credit cards as part of that service.<\/p> <p> A number of violent assaults were perpetrated against drivers last year.  While there are no Garda statistics collected on the number of taxi drivers who are assaulted, Tiomana&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, TTNE, has said publicly that it is concerned and that drivers have witnessed a spike in attacks over recent months.  These include violent attacks taxi drivers involving knives and bottles and taxi drivers being punched, kicked and bitten.  It stands to reason that to prevent such violent assaults, there should be tougher sentences for persons convicted of offences against taxi drivers and an effort made to ensure there is greater use of electronic funds rather than cash within taxis.  Drivers are providing service to the public in a particularly intimate, high-risk situation and require greater legislative protection against the threat of assault.  Given the lack of physical separation of taxi drivers from their cab in this country, which physical separation is the case in the UK, there should be specific offences introduced to discourage offences against taxi drivers who are especially vulnerable to such attacks.<\/p> <p> Part 3 introduces a technical amendment to the Road Traffic Act 2014, inserting an amendment relating to disqualification for persons indicted for hit and run.  We welcome this technical change which provides legislative clarity to the earlier Act.  Fianna F&aacute;il's own Road Traffic Bill 2013 provided the impetus behind the introduction of this Act.  It sought to crack down on hit-and-run drivers by introducing tougher penalties and extending the power of arrest of the Garda.  Under Fianna F&aacute;il's proposed Road Traffic Bill 2013, it would have been an indictable offence for anyone to leave the scene of an accident resulting in injury.  The offence would have carried a punishment of up to ten years' imprisonment and-or a fine of up to &euro;5,000.<\/p> <p> While at the time we welcomed the Government's acceptance of our key recommendations on tougher sentences for persons convicted of hit-and-run offences, we were disappointed with its refusal to grant additional powers to the Garda to test individuals suspected of a hit and run for alcohol intoxication for up to 24 hours, citing legal investigation barriers.  While the Minister accepted the broad thrust of our Bill, he did not include all of it in his Bill.  In particular, he omitted the provision to expand the period for which drivers could be tested for alcohol from four to 24 hours.  This is a point we urge the Government to reconsider as the law incentivises persons involved in a traffic accident to flee the scene of an accident to avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication.  In not accepting this provision in our Bill, the Minister said that for a driver to be arrested for drink driving, they have to be breathalysed while they are in their vehicle.  However, the situation obviously creates an incentive for the drivers of these vehicles to flee the scene of the offence so as not to be found to be intoxicated.<\/p><p> The Minister should reconsider the benefits of this provision from the Fianna F&aacute;il Road Traffic Bill 2013.  He should extend the power of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to test for alcohol or drugs up to 24 hours.  He should also provide that in the case of persons arrested on suspicion of a hit and run offence the results of a breathalyser test can be considered admissible evidence in court.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill and we look forward to adjudicating on any amendments the Minister seeks to bring forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000039#NN00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435690500,"counter":401,"content":"<p>This is a fairly technical Bill which deals with a number of issues relating to public transport which are important and not very controversial.  A number of sections deal with different aspects of transport such as safety, fines and accidents.  However some very controversial issues arise in any more general discussion of public transport.  At present, the public transport services owned by the State are CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  These companies have struggled through and survived the worst of the economic downturn but they now face many new challenges.  Some of these challenges are positive.  For instance, it is important that public transport companies are challenged by their service-users to become more accessible, more intuitive and reliable, through the use of innovation and technology.  Despite a slow lead-in, in the past few years these companies have embraced the use of technology to make their services better.  Very few Dubliners under a certain age do not have the Dublin Bus app on their telephone or a Leap card in their wallet.  Most people have also used online features provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.  The one failing is in the integrated information apps developed by Transport for Ireland which feel like something created by someone who has never actually had to depend on public transport in Ireland.  Most people I have spoken to regarding these integrated apps have said they are not worth attempting to use.  Bizarrely, there are two apps provided by Transport for Ireland rather than one integrated app combining real-time information with journey planning.<\/p>  <p>  Some other challenges, such as high fuel costs, are being tackled to a degree by use of other fuel sources and technological innovations in vehicles but more could be done.  Public transport could be given a proper fuel rebate, for instance.  However, the major challenge is the Government&rsquo;s attacks on the pillars of Irish public transport.  Since coming into office the State subsidy for public transport, which was already far too low compared to other European states, has been cut by over 20%.  Rubbing salt into this wound the Government has aggressively sought to undermine public transport companies by ignoring the concerns of workers and putting in motion a privatisation plan which will act as the thin end of the wedge.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and Labour have now driven through their privatisation agenda by planning the tendering to private companies of 10% of public bus routes and 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in Waterford.  This will not happen for a while but already it is has damaged public transport provision.  Earlier this year, Bus &Eacute;ireann began the process of removing some routes which received no subsidy from the State but were important in linking rural communities.  It did this because the company is attempting to streamline its services as much as possible so as to protect its PSO routes from going into private hands in the coming years.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus know that the loss of one subsidised route will endanger another route and that with every route lost to under-cutting multinational bus companies, public transport in Ireland will lurch another step towards its own death.  The multinationals that will claim these routes will have little concern for the public good or the conditions of their workers.  For them, unlike Dublin Bus, the only objective will be to protect shareholders and stock prices.  The NBRU has also highlighted that current legislation does not offer clear protection from tendering to the other 90% of routes.  It is clear that if the State tenders 10% of routes it is opening itself up to legal challenges which may bring privatisation even sooner than the Government planned.  This legally weak position must be dealt with in legislation and I hope to put forward relevant amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any progress on the development of greater bus services in Dublin.  Bus rapid transport, BRT, could present that possibility.  That being said, it is a great expense if only one route is being provided.  Although three routes have been mentioned, only one is currently under consideration, the Swords route.  Could this money not be better used in providing more buses, more quality bus corridors and bus lanes?  Could some of the principles of BRT, such as priority crossing, be applied to some existing bus routes?  The main benefit of BRT is that it is faster than other bus services because it treats buses separately from private cars.  Some cities which saw great benefit from BRTs were cities which did not previously have bus lanes in any form.  Approximately 150 cities use some form of BRT transport.<\/p>  <p>  Improving our bus services and their access to the road could potentially make our entire network better.  Metro North could also provide a high capacity rapid transport system to the airport.  Metro North or a rail system would allow for high levels of passenger numbers whereas BRT would carry lower numbers of passengers.  A rail system would take cars off the road and provide a cross-city service to the airport.  Rather than an expensive headline-grabbing and shiny new BRT, perhaps what is needed is to support rather than undermine the bus service we have.  If BRT is the chosen option then it must be under the management of Dublin Bus, a company that is expert in the delivery of bus services and is dedicated to public services and best placed to integrate any new service into the existing network.  Sinn F&eacute;in would strongly oppose any move to put the BRT in private hands.  The Luas is a good example of how even in the best of circumstances, private operators are not better than public operators.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to sections 2 and 3 which deal with taxi services.  I wish to raise some issues affecting taxi drivers.  I welcome the extension to nine months instead of three of the period within which a taxi licence can be passed on to a bereaved family member.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for greater access to this provision from its inception.  I am pleased the Minister listened to that argument because three months was too short a time.  We encountered many people who were very anxious as a result.  This is a good move which will help many families.  I recently spoke to the widow of taxi driver who had suffered a great deal of financial hardship in the wake of her husband's death.  She was completely unaware of any provision for such a transfer.  More needs to be done to communicate this to people like that lady.  There was initial confusion with regard to this provision.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the new period for paying fixed charges.  We need to ensure that while regulating taxi drivers, punishing wrong-doing and upholding standards, we do not mistreat a group of hardworking people trying to make a living and contributing to our transport network with good levels of efficiency.  The recent removal of taxi ranks across the State and the failure to provide alternatives for these people is not acceptable.  We need taxis in our towns and cities and we need drivers to be able to ply for hire at ranks.  The Luas cross-city project has led to major problems for taxi drivers.  Construction work is part of a living breathing city but these drivers have been uprooted and put out by these works without any consideration for their needs in providing their service.  We need ranks for taxi drivers and we need them where the customers are.  I understand that this is often a role for the local authority but it is not always so easy for councils to respond in situations such as the major works involved in the Luas extension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000041#PP00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435690500,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Scheme: Motion [Private Members]","time":1435691100,"counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000042#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1435691100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<blockquote><blockquote>&mdash; condemns the choices made by the current Government and its predecessor to force lone parent households to disproportionately shoulder the burden of cuts in the wake of an economic crash that was not of their, or their children&rsquo;s, making;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recognises that the entirely foreseeable consequences of the series of social welfare cuts targeting lone parents has been a rise in the number of lone parents households experiencing enforced deprivation to its current staggering rate of 63 per cent;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; rejects the claims made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, and others in Government, that the purpose of the latest impending cut to the One Parent Family Payment scheme is to encourage lone parents to take up work and noting that it is only those lone parents who are actually in work whose weekly income will suffer a significant hit from this Thursday, 2nd July when the cut off age is lowered to just seven years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recalls the Government&rsquo;s commitment not to proceed with the cut in the absence of adequate childcare provision; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; calls on the Government, given the absence of such childcare provision, not to proceed with the lowering of the cut-off age to seven years and to instead raise it to twelve years, and to this end commits to sit late to facilitate the passage of the necessary emergency legislation.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>It gives me no pleasure to introduce this motion because the fact that we are discussing it at this time means that lone parents are facing into more misery on Thursday than they had endured until now.  The group of people our motion is trying to protect is one of the most deprived groups in the State.  The latest survey on income and living conditions based on 2013 data shows that nearly 32% of children and adults in one-parent families are at risk of poverty.  There is a deprivation rate of 63%.  The T&aacute;naiste knows these figures because they have been quoted to her previously.  There is a consistent poverty rate of 23%, which is an indictment of Irish society and of Government.<\/p><p>What does it all mean?  It means that group in Irish society is among the poorest and most deserving of State interventions to help them out of that poverty.  They do not deserve measures that exacerbate that poverty, as the Government has done since it took office.  It is coupled with the actions of the previous Government which also heaped cuts on lone parents.  The T&aacute;naiste knows this well because she implemented these cuts affecting lone parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  Not all of the payments are directed solely at lone parents.  Other social welfare cuts that the T&aacute;naiste implemented impacted to a higher degree on lone parents.<\/p><p>Not only did the T&aacute;naiste reduce the age threshold to seven, as we are discussing, but she had previously reduced it from 12 to ten.  It was reduced to 12 by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  I remember the discussion on the reduction in age during the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  I remember the Labour Deputies jumping up and down, apoplectic that a government would cut the age of the youngest qualifying child from 18 to 12.  What did the T&aacute;naiste do when she came to power?  She did the exact same.<\/p><p>Not only that, she also reduced the qualified child increases where a parent is on CE and also on one-parent family payment, with a resultant loss to lone parents of &euro;29.80 a week.  Many of the half-rate payments that a lone parent might have qualified for in the past were also discontinued.  The income disregard was reduced, initially from &euro;146.50 to &euro;130 and then to &euro;90.  Does the T&aacute;naiste remember that?  Of course, she crowed that she did not cut it further to &euro;60, which had been the intention.  The reduction from &euro;146.50 to &euro;90 equates to a working lone mother or father being down &euro;28 a week.  Very few families can sustain that, especially families in poverty.<\/p><p>Income from home-help employment with the HSE was also disregarded by the Government.  They also lost out, as did others with the six-week reduction in the fuel allowance.  Some 60% of those in emergency accommodation are lone-parent families.  They depend more heavily on rent allowance and social housing and we know the debacle the Government and the previous Government have made of that.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste also reduced child benefit, not by &euro;10, but by up to &euro;47 in some cases.  Again that impacted on lone parents and other parents.  The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was cut from &euro;305 to &euro;250.  Again that cut affected the poorest in Irish society, but in particular lone parents.<\/p><p>  What is the T&aacute;naiste's problem with lone parents?  Why does she keep picking on them?  Every action of the T&aacute;naiste's in respect of lone parents has had a negative impact on them.  The Minster promised in 2012 that she would stand up to a suspension of any move towards the age of seven until she saw the bankable commitment on Scandinavian child care gives the lie to the Government&rsquo;s purportedly caring approach to the vulnerable.  This is one of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society yet the Government has raided their piggybanks, pockets and allowances.  I charge the T&aacute;naiste with not caring about lone parents.  She has gone after them consistently since the Government was elected, by some bizarre logic of her own.  She claims the measure we are discussing today will help encourage lone parents back to work but her position is illogical because the working lone parents are some of those most negatively affected by this cut.  The T&aacute;naiste should at the very least live up to the promise she made in this Chamber, not only to lone parents but to all Irish society.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste has a few hours left to act.  Tomorrow night we will vote on this motion, an hour before her latest change comes into effect.  I am not holding out much hope because I read the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s amendment to our motion.  It is pathetic, in the extreme.  The T&aacute;naiste ignores the fact that it was she who made a commitment, not me, or Deputy O&rsquo;Dea or whoever was the relevant Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, that she has not lived up to.  It appears from her amendment to our motion that she has no intention of living up to it.  Her intention is to continue to attack those lone parents who are working and will be negatively affected by these changes.<\/p> <p> I attempted last week to produce a social welfare (amendment) Bill, which would have had the effect of rowing back on the changes the T&aacute;naiste introduced.  Bizarrely, however, the Bills Office stated to me that I could not produce a positive Bill because it is precluded by the Constitution.  At the Convention on the Constitution, however, the Labour Party Deputies argued in favour of the position I took, that the provision in the Constitution that precludes me, other Opposition Deputies or Government backbenchers, from putting down positive financial resolutions be removed.  The Government has not debated that report, which was published in March 2014 with a promise that it would be considered within three months.  The Government has not had the decency to hold that debate in this Chamber and acknowledge the work of the convention and respect it so that we can make positive proposals.<\/p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000042#QQ00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435691400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>This Government and in particular the Labour Party have earned the unenviable reputation of being anti-woman and anti-child and do not seem to care who knows it.  It appears to have made a calculated decision that lone parents, like carers and other vulnerable sections of society are inconsequential.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste figures they are a section of voters whose support she does not really need, or so she thinks.  If she made her decisions based on what is right, fair and socially responsible, she would not introduce another cut to the one-parent family payment.  The T&aacute;naiste and I know, and the families concerned certainly know, that the right, fair and responsible thing to do is not to introduce this latest anti-family measure.<\/p>  <p>  Politically, it seems the T&aacute;naiste feels she has no reason to fear this section of the electorate.  Cynically, she has decided she does not need their votes to get re-elected, which makes it easier to introduce this cut on top of a raft of draconian cuts that are anti-woman and anti-child.  Since taking office, this Government has made eight separate cuts to payments to lone-parent families.  In its latest measure of the 30,000 lone parents affected, approximately 20,000 are to be transferred onto the new transitional job seeker's allowance.  Thousands of these struggling parents will see their income fall.  More than 10,000 will have weekly payments cut by as much as &euro;87 per week.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste and some of her Cabinet colleagues to set out for these families, who are already struggling on very low incomes where they propose they find that additional &euro;87, how they propose these families struggle on regardless, having lost &euro;87 per week.  That is a lot of money by any standards but it is utterly devastating for lone-parent families who are already under significant pressure, many of whom already live in poverty.  Yet this Government is hell-bent on forcing more of these families into poverty.  Most lone parents are women, 86% at the last census.  Many are in low-paid and insecure jobs.  Some 56% of lone-parent families are materially deprived.  That is a shocking and disgraceful statistic.  A total of 28% live at risk of poverty, twice the rate for two-parent families.  CSO figures show that 63% of lone-parent families live without basic necessities, yet the T&aacute;naiste feels that it is fair, responsible and just to punish them again and to make a brutal cut of &euro;87 per week to the weekly income of 10,000 of these families <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the highest child care costs in the OECD.  The average cost of child care per week in this State is &euro;167 and it is higher in Dublin.  Child care can cost as much as 52% of the take home pay of a lone parent.  The T&aacute;naiste knows all of these facts and figures yet the Government has said that these changes, which will cause additional hardship for already struggling lone parents, would only take place when a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care was put in place, similar to that found in Scandinavian countries.  Does the T&aacute;naiste remember saying that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000043#RR00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1435691400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000043#RR00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435691400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The Government stated that the measures which reduced the upper age limit to seven years would only occur when there was a credible system of child care in place.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste emphasised that if this was not forthcoming, the Government would not proceed with the measures.  The question then arises of where is this safe, affordable and accessible child care and where is this equivalent of the Scandinavian model.  It is nowhere to be seen, not for any family, much less for struggling lone-parent families.  The T&aacute;naiste knows this and she now blatantly disregards a concrete commitment made by her, of her own volition, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said.  That commitment was categoric, not hedged by any equivocation and absolute.  It was made to lone-parent families but, now, the T&aacute;naiste openly, brazenly and recklessly breaks that promise, with absolutely no regard for the consequences for those families.<\/p> <p> We all know that parenting is a full-time job.  God knows, it is difficult when there are two parents on hand.  Consider how much more difficult it can be and is for people parenting alone, looking after one or more children without that additional support, not to mention not having the comfort of knowing there is that second partner to back them up, to stand by them and to contribute economically.<\/p> <p> Where a lone parent is lucky enough to have a job and a decent living wage, which is not always the case, that extra income improves the quality of life for lone parents and their families.  That is why so many lone parents are anxious to work and why so many do work.  Yet, this measure, which the T&aacute;naiste tries to hype up as a labour activation initiative, will in fact penalise those parents who are at work.  Within my own constituency and community, I know many women who now, with the T&aacute;naiste's cut, will be left with no option but to back away from work.  Therefore, far from activating labour and opening new opportunities to lone parents, who are mainly women, the T&aacute;naiste is in fact shutting them down.<\/p> <p> If it is the T&aacute;naiste's goal to encourage lone parents to take up work, then I suggest that she sticks to her promises and stops sticking it to lone parents.  I commend this motion to the House.  I would ask every Deputy, from both sides, to support the motion, especially those on the Labour benches who have, I understand, expressed their concerns on these measures at this time and on previous occasions.  I would ask them and the T&aacute;naiste to think long and very hard about what they are doing, and to think about the thousands of one-parent families they are undoubtedly condemning to poverty.  Remember the concrete promise the T&aacute;naiste made and live up to that.<\/p> <p> That is the request not just of Sinn F&eacute;in or of Deputies on the Opposition benches.  It is the plea - in fact, it is the demand - that has been made of the T&aacute;naiste from single-parent families across the State.  I think they would want the T&aacute;naiste to know they are not soft targets.  If the T&aacute;naiste has perhaps made a cynical political calculation, she might find that her calculation was wrong and that she will have a mighty lobby and a mighty force waiting for her and her colleagues on the Government benches when they finally go to the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000043#RR00400","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435692000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I have lost count of how many times I have had to come in here to challenge galling cutbacks that this Government seems content to introduce.  It does not get any easier to watch Fine Gael and the Labour Party implementing such savage cuts.  In fact, it gets harder because as the reality of what the Government decides on paper in here comes knocking on the doors of ordinary families across this State, the increasing effects of successive cuts are unavoidable.  These cutbacks affect all walks of lives, all generations and all communities across our society.  The real-life consequences are life-changing, heart-breaking and often that one cut too far that turns basic living for families into a daily struggle to survive.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion is another attempt to make this Government act on its sheer lack of basic compassion.  It is another attempt to try to alert the Government to the impact of its actions.<\/p>  <p>  This cut to lone parents is going to be another cut that plunges families further into inescapable poverty.  It will cripple single mothers and single fathers with unbearable child care costs and it will mean that, for many, life as they know it will change for the worse.  However, this is not the first time the Government has picked on vulnerable lone parents.  Some 11,000 lone parents have already been affected by gradual reductions in their payments.  These cuts have caused unimaginable hardship for lone-parent families, 63% of whom are struggling to afford the basic necessities.  However, the Government has once again managed to outdo itself and the next round of cuts to lone parents will impact on 30,000 families.<\/p>  <p>  Where does the Government expect these lone parents to get the money to pay the extortionate child care costs?  The T&aacute;naiste promised that these cuts would not be implemented until child care was affordable and after-school care was made available.  That has not happened.  It is sad to see just how much the T&aacute;naiste's promises are worth.  I wonder whether the Government has any idea just how crippling child care costs actually are.  Given the cost of child care, it often becomes the case that two-parent families are in full-time work with one wage being solely to cover the cost of someone to look after the children.  It can be the case that the child care burden is left to an aging grandparent or an older sibling and it is often the case that it is not economical for families to have both parents at work, so the second parent has to stay at home.<\/p>  <p>  In my own constituency of Donegal North-East, to give one example although I could give many, I know of a hardworking young couple, a construction worker and a nurse with two young children who could only afford for one parent to work because of crippling child care costs.  It did not make sense for both of them to work and they were not lucky enough to have a relative living close by to give them a helping hand.  What happens in those cases where there is no second parent?  What happens to single mothers and fathers who cannot afford to pay someone to look after the children?  The cut to their allowance will mean that staying at home will be the only viable option.  Does the Government expect lone parents to leave their livelihood behind and stay at home to live off welfare?  I would hope that this is not something the Government is advocating because apart from the fact that such support is inadequate for families to live off, the mental health and economic implications are far from ideal.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste must see that is the reality of these cutbacks.  She has tied the hands of our lone parents and is guiding them into a bleak and unsustainable future.  Lone-parent households were a priority for Sinn F&eacute;in in our alternative budget last year.  Cutbacks are not the way to go in helping these families.  What is needed is an increase to the earnings disregard on the one-parent family payment scheme, increases to fuel allowance, FIS, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the restoration of some dignity to lone parents.  The T&aacute;naiste should consider what she is doing here.  The cuts to the lone parents allowance must be reversed.  If she was to abandon her plans, she would receive nothing but support.  Stop bullying some of our most vulnerable citizens and give them a chance.  Lone parent families have been through enough without enduring the further hardship these cuts will cause.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to remember that what she decides here on paper has real-life consequences for vulnerable families in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000044#SS00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1435692600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which I hope will get the support of Members, particularly of Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection stated that she would not proceed with any reduction in lone parent's allowance or would not alter the payments unless, as she stated, \"I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  If this was not forthcoming, the measure will not proceed\".  She was referring there to a Scandinavian style system of affordable child care.  However, nothing has been done to bring that about.  Instead, the T&aacute;naiste is going ahead with the cut being introduced this week.  This is a huge issue and it is clear that the T&aacute;naiste's promises do not mean much.  I am very disappointed with her in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste claims the cut will encourage lone parents to take up employment or to increase the hours they work.  I am certain lone parents want to work but the lone parents who have complained to me about this cut and those who will suffer its impact are lone parents who are already working.  They are the ones affected by this.  Did the T&aacute;naiste not realise when she was introducing this cut that these are the people who are affected?  Therefore, this is not an employment incentive as is claimed, but another cut that is being made in order to save a small amount of money.  However, the Department will wind up losing money because this measure will push some of these vulnerable lone parents out of work.  This is the opposite of what Sinn F&eacute;in wants.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants these people in the workforce and wants to support them to get into it.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that this cut is the latest in a long list of cuts by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  They have carried on from what Fianna F&aacute;il did.  Today I counted the cuts made and found that the Government has implemented eight cuts that affect lone parents directly.  Two cuts were made in January 2012, one in May 2012, one in January 2013, one in July 2013, one in January 2014, one in July 2014 and now we have this one for July 2015.  This contrasts strongly with the overall up-beat message being broadcast by the Government regarding the economy.  If things are improving, that is good, but where is the improvement for lone parents who are trying to hold down jobs or what pressure is being lifted from them?  If the State's finances are improving and there is a welcome increase in revenue for the State, surely lone parents deserve as much as anybody else to get some relief from the relentless austerity they have faced.  Where is the fair recovery for them?  Sinn F&eacute;in has made calculations that show that the impact of the changes on some families will amount to &euro;86 per week.  This is a huge amount of money for people on low incomes who are struggling to pay child care costs.  No higher income group of earners has been asked to take such a proportionate hit. <\/p>  <p>  On top of this, what did the T&aacute;naiste do the weekend before this cut is due to be implemented?  If the newspapers are telling the truth, she put the spin to or briefed them saying she was demanding - \"demanding\" how are you - a &euro;5 increase in child benefit per month.  That amounts to &euro;60 per year, about &euro;1.10 per week.  That is an insult to lone parents and people who are struggling.  Few higher earners have had to endure anything like the eight cuts imposed.  The T&aacute;naiste should not call them anything else.  She can dance around the issue whatever way she likes, but all of those cuts have increase the austerity.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the T&aacute;naiste ask what was in Sinn F&eacute;in's budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposed increasing the income disregard for lone parents, in order to help them stay in employment.  What the T&aacute;naiste is doing is not fair.  Our party would like to see more people at work.  In particular, we want to help lone parents get into the workforce and support them with education, training and child care in order to do that.  Child care does not exist for them now.  It is worse now than ever.<\/p>  <p>  The main factor keeping single parents out of the workforce is low wages.  I recognise that the Government undid the cut imposed by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, the scandalous cut in the minimum wage.  However this Government needs to go a step further with the minimum wage.  It is still too low.  The second major factor in keeping single parents out of work is child care.  Unless child care costs are lowered, which will require State intervention, it will remain impossible for many people to take up employment and to earn enough money to sustain themselves and support their families.  I call on all sides of the House to support our motion and the call for this cut to be set aside.  I call for other measures to be put in place, such as measures to improve the minimum wage and child care. <\/p>  <p>  What the T&aacute;naiste has done with this cut is she has hurt those lone parents who are work.  She has hit working lone parents.  This has boomeranged back on her.  She needs to stop and undo this measure and not go ahead with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000045#TT00100","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435692600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Ireland is a tough place to raise a child, particularly for lone parents.  They can take little or no solace from the actions of the Government if they hope society, through government, will protect them and the interests of their child.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the highest level of child care costs in the OECD.  This, coupled with a poor public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and the lack of adequate housing, makes the lives of lone parents very difficult.  The Government claims to be focused on getting people back to work, but what it is doing is creating a situation where it is making it increasingly difficult for people to work.  Thousands of families are attempting to survive on the limited income they have.<\/p>  <p>  In the recent referendum, the people gave a clear vote that they wanted all families of different make-ups to be recognised and supported by the State.  However, it seems that the State is unwilling to support all of these families or make it viable to raise their children in the comfort and security that they need and deserve.  The T&aacute;naiste promised that these cuts would not be enacted without affordable and accessible  child care and after school care.  These facilities are not in place.  Therefore, lone parents are abandoned in the wilderness to fend for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Many families find themselves in this situation.  According to the 2011 census, one in every eight people in Ireland lives in a one-parent family.  One in every four families with children is a one-parent family.  This means over 500,000 people are living in one parent families.  These parents are not just restricted to single mothers.  The figures show us that 13.5% of these one-parent families are headed by a male.   People in lone parent households tend to have the lowest disposable income out of all households in the State.  Those living in lone parent households continue to experience the highest rates of deprivation, with almost 69% of individuals from these households experiencing one or more forms of deprivation.  Why any government that calls itself a caring government or why any society would choose to pick on the 69% who are most deprived and decide to hit them beggars belief.  People do not understand the logic behind what the Government is doing.  It is hitting those who are least able to pay, all under the fiction that it is enabling them to get back to work.<\/p>  <p>  The Government promised many things prior to and immediately after the last election.  It promised a democratic revolution and to defend the weakest in society.  The stark reality is that people such as lone parents are cast aside and are seen as expendable to the future of this society.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a number of measures to help the plight of lone parents and to provide greater financial security to them, including an increase to the earnings disregard in the one-parent family payment scheme.<\/p><p>We also proposed increases to funding that would benefit lone parents, such as fuel allowance and back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Unless the T&aacute;naiste is a master hypnotherapist and she can hypnotise all of society, she will not convince lone parents, nor will she convince the wider population, that the cuts are good for those vulnerable people or their children.  Neither will she convince society that she is keeping her solemn promise on behalf of the Government that the changes would not be introduced unless quality, accessible child care is available.<\/p> <p> There is no shame in any person saying he or she got is slightly wrong although he or she had the right intentions.  From listening to the comments of Government backbenchers, in particular Labour Party backbenchers, they want the change too.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to withdraw her amendment to the motion so as not to force honourable backbenchers to vote in a dishonourable way tomorrow night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000045#TT00200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435693200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>It is a point repeated so often that it almost loses all meaning, namely, that we judge a state by how it looks after its most vulnerable citizens.  However, that is really a power principle and should be the basic bar by which we judge all our decisions in politics, namely, whether a measure hurts those who have least or target those who have been unfairly targeted already, and whether it is fair.<\/p>  <p>  Some on the other side of this House might have us believe that seeking to be fair is not being realistic because they have decided to take the easy option and cannot countenance that there could be another way.  If the Labour Party were to think like that, then its members would have to look inside themselves and realise they are a pointless adjunct to Fine Gael, and that they have once again wrestled with their conscience and their conscience has lost.  If Labour Party members were to do that, they would truly see the hurt they are causing by those kinds of decision.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is unfair.  It hurts those who have the least and it again targets those who have already been targeted either in budget cuts or the stigma successive Governments have created for single parents.<\/p>  <p>  As the motion states, the policy of the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government which preceded it was to load the burden of the banking crisis onto the shoulders of working class people who were desperately trying to keep their jobs, pay their rent, keep their home and feed and clothe their children.  No family was more vulnerable to the cuts, more hurt and even vilified than the single-parent families of this State.  This approach has seen an unprecedented and unconscionable rise in deprivation levels of 63%.  One could ask what exactly that means, and what is the truly horrible reality behind that figure for families struggling every day.  The deprivation indicators are shockingly basic.  For some people it is hard to imagine there are people raising families in such conditions, but there are.  Their situation is not punishment for some wrongdoing but simply a consequence of the unequal society presided over by successive right-wing Governments more concerned with the needs of Ireland&rsquo;s own oligarchs than child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Despite that, the Government plans to cut more from the one-parent family payment scheme.  This time the T&aacute;naiste has tried to spin the lie the underlying intention is to get single parents back to work.  She knows that is not the true intention of the cut.  One would have to have been living under a rock for the past four years to believe that nonsense.  This State is the second worst country for low-paid jobs in the developed world.  We have no real State support for child care and have consistently cut social supports for unemployed and low-income families over the past seven years.  One could ask how the parents of young children hope to go back to jobs that either do not exist or pay next to nothing when it will mean a loss of vital and basic supports.<\/p>  <p>  What is even more disgusting about the claim by the Government is that it implies that single parents are sitting at home living off the fat of land, having a great old time with their expensive camera phones and flat screen televisions while refusing to do a day&rsquo;s work.  Those parents are some of the hardest working people in the country because they have the task of not only raising their children but doing it with everything against them, including the Government and the so-called Labour Party.<\/p>  <p>  The attitude the Government has taken to working class families is an absolute disgrace, which bears no resemblance to the reality of what they are dealing with on daily basis.  As Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said last week and to the T&aacute;naiste tonight, she and her Government are giving two fingers to those struggling families.  The Government is saying it does not care how hard it is, how little one has or how much it has taken already, they are an easy target and the Government will use them so it does not have to tackle the powerful and the elites who have never paid their fair share.<\/p>  <p>  In the same way that single parents were vilified, scape-goated and abused by previous Governments, the Government continues with the approach but does it wrapped in a veil to pretend it is all being done for the good of those affected.  That is a shame on the T&aacute;naiste, and a shame on the Labour Party.  They have given two fingers to working class families, and in doing so, two fingers to everything they claim to represent.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Robert Dowds, said on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night that he had very serious problems with the scheme.  We will wait and see where he stands.  He obviously has very serious concerns, as does everyone else.  The decision the T&aacute;naiste has made is an absolute disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000046#UU00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1435693200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I believe the T&aacute;naiste is sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000046#UU00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1435693200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;acknowledges that despite significant levels of investment, including an estimated &euro;607 million in 2015, the one parent family payment scheme has not been successful in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole;<br \/><br \/>recognises that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in 2004, during the height of the economic boom lone parents were more than four and-a-half times more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole - survey on income and living conditions, SILC, data;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; during the economic boom Ireland&rsquo;s rate of lone parent employment was substantially below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average of over 70%; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s supports for lone parents need to be updated in order to provide for greater levels of opportunity for lone parents and for their children;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges that the very long duration, potentially 18-22 years, can engender long term social welfare dependency and associated poverty and social exclusion amongst lone parents and their families;<br \/><br \/>welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision to retain the one parent family payment income at &euro;90 per week;<br \/><br \/>recognises the difficulties experienced by persons renting or seeking to rent in the current market fundamentally due to the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation;<br \/><br \/>recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; maintain core social welfare weekly rates of payment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; tackle long term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the labour force indefinitely;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; enhance lone parents&rsquo; access to the range of education, training and employment supports and services in order to develop their skills set with the aim of securing employment and financial independence;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; support lone parents to make the transition from the one parent family payment onto another social welfare payment; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 strategy and the social housing strategy;<br \/><br \/>recognises that the Department of Social Protection has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs under the rent supplement scheme through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.

The Department works with Threshold&rsquo;s tenancy sustainment service in Dublin city and Cork city.

This is delivered through a range of childcare programmes for children, including the free pre-school year provided under the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, programme and as a range of supports provided to low income parents, that is, community childcare subvention programme, childcare education and training support programme, after-school childcare programme and community employment childcare, CEC, programme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the establishment of an interdepartmental group to carry out an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality child care;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the decision to allow lone parents in receipt of half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance to retain their one parent family payment until their youngest child is 16 years of age;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; allowing lone parents who are currently undertaking an education course and are in receipt of a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance grant to maintain both their one parent family payment and the SUSI maintenance grant until they have completed their course of study; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the research the Department of Social Protection is sponsoring into an active inclusion approach to lone parents, which is examining best practice and innovative approaches to assisting lone parents improve their well-being; and recognises that after the reform lone parents with children who are aged seven years or older and in employment will continue to receive substantial support from the Department of Social Protection, such as:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a lone parent with one child who has no work will receive on a jobseeker's payment almost &euro;218 per week;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; if they work 19 hours at the national minimum wage they will receive on top of their wages &euro;235 per week between FIS and the back to work family dividend &ndash; a total family income of &euro;400 per week;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a lone parent with two children on a jobseeker's payment with no work receives almost &euro;248 per week from the Department of Social Protection; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; if they work 19 hours at the national minimum wage they will receive on top of their wages &euro;323 per week between FIS and the back to work family dividend &ndash; a total family income of &euro;488 per week;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a lone parent with three children and no work on a jobseeker's payment will receive almost &euro;278 per week from the Department of Social Protection; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; if they work 19 hours at the national minimum wage they will receive on top of their wages &euro;413 per week between FIS and the back to work family dividend &ndash; a total family income of &euro;578 per week.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>I welcome the debate generated by the changes to the one-parent family payment, OFP, scheme.  It is important that a populist party such as Sinn F&eacute;in, which at times claims to be left wing, should debate these issues.  The changes are critically important because, over time, they will help greatly to reduce poverty among single-parent families.  The easiest thing in politics is to do nothing, to shirk reforms that will be positive in the long term because a populist party such as Sinn F&eacute;in can seek to use them to claim that they would be otherwise.  It would be the easiest thing in the world to call a halt to the one-parent family reforms - as Sinn F&eacute;in would do for short-term political gain that would ignore what is actually happening for families where people are parenting on their own.  Yet Sinn F&eacute;in's answer, which is really about a welfare economy, is not a sustainable answer.  Then again, Sinn F&eacute;in never does serious policies or serious answers.<\/p><p>Deputy Gerry Adams wanted Ireland to tell the institutions to go home and take their money with them.  Unfortunately, we can now see where that approach has got the poor people of Greece.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to abolish the property tax and water charges, but how would it fund services, and who in society would pay for them?  In that respect, tonight's motion and the contributions so far have been utterly predictable.  In its rush to populism, Sinn F&eacute;in shows zero interest in tackling poverty, because the strongest protection against poverty is decent, secure and fairly paid work.  That has been my abiding political conviction since I first entered politics and it has informed me throughout my career.<\/p><p>The Labour Party is the party of work, the party that believes in providing opportunity for all.  Being on social welfare for 18 to 22 years is not opportunity.  It is society saying that we have no higher ambition for a person or for their children.<\/p><p>At times, listening to the Sinn F&eacute;in contributors tonight, I got the impression they did not want anybody to leave social welfare.  Perhaps they feel they have more control over people if they are permanently in receipt of social welfare.

A strong welfare system is essential as a safety net.  In the teeth of Ireland's worst economic crisis, the Labour Party in government protected this safety net and, with the recovery under way, has started making targeted increases.  All the increases are fully funded and sustainable, and are the work of a party serious about its responsibilities to our State and our people.  It is not enough to have the system function as a strong safety net.  It must also help people to get back on their feet, build financial independence over time and build better lives for themselves and their families.  This is the purpose of the one-parent reforms.<\/p>  <p>  When the Government took office, we had one overriding task, namely, to rebuild an economy in ruins, and rescue people's livelihoods in the process.  Today, we have a jobs-led recovery and unemployment has fallen by more than a third since its crisis peak.  Although it was an incredibly tough and painful period for our people, the sacrifices everybody made are paying off now.  Had we made the wrong choices, it could have been very different.  Throughout the worst of the crisis, we protected core weekly welfare rates.  When the public finances were at their most vulnerable, we protected the most vulnerable.  This helped maintain social cohesion.  Our system of social transfers, as welfare payments are known, is the single most effective in the EU at preventing poverty.  This is a fact, and is the Labour Party's record in government.<\/p>  <p>  This is also a reforming Government, and it was clear from the evidence that the one-parent family scheme was in need of serious reform.  Despite significant levels of investment - more than &euro;1 billion a year from 2008 to 2012 - the scheme has consistently failed to prevent lone parents being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole, as speaker after speaker from Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledged.  This also leaves the children of lone parents at a high risk of poverty.  I know how ambitious lone parents are for their children.  The fact that children of lone parents are at a higher risk of poverty is not something Sinn F&eacute;in should defend and seek to leave unchanged.  While Sinn F&eacute;in Members may be sincere, I sincerely think they are wrong.  According to the most recent survey on income and living conditions, SILC, which half of the Sinn F&eacute;in Members quoted, 23% of lone parents are at risk of consistent poverty.  This is two and half times greater than the population as a whole.  If a lone parent is in work, the risk falls to about 10% while if he or she is not in work, the risk can be above 40%.  The figure of 23% is a blend of the people in work with a much lower risk of poverty and the people out of work, who have a very high risk of poverty.  This is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Before the reforms, Ireland was alone internationally in how we supported lone parents.  Lone parents could have been on the one-parent family scheme until their youngest child turned 18, or 22 if the child was in full-time education.  Other countries have moved away from providing income support of such long duration towards a shorter, more active, engagement approach.  In New Zealand, the Netherlands and the UK, including Northern Ireland, the equivalent supports for lone parent cease when the youngest child reaches the age of five.  I have never heard Sinn F&eacute;in in the North complain that support for lone parents stops when the youngest child is five.  I do not know whether the Sinn F&eacute;in Members here are aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  The countries I mentioned have better-developed child care systems.  The Government is committed to improving the provision of child care, including the supports available for lone parents.  We have introduced schemes that offer heavily subsidised child care places to assist lone parents to take up a community employment place or a job.  I resent the cheap remarks by Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh on the provision of child care for people on community employment schemes, which is very good and heavily subsidised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000047#VV01000","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435693800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Resent away, God love you.

Both these schemes build on the annual investment of &euro;260 million into high quality child care, which benefits approximately 100,000 children each year.  We do not yet have sufficient quantity and quality in our child care system.  This is why I very deliberately ensured that the age threshold at which the one-parent family payment ends would be two years higher, at seven years of age, than in the North or the countries I mentioned.  In addition, I ensured that when the child is aged between seven and 14, lone parents will be exempted from the welfare conditionality that requires people to be genuinely seeking full-time work in order to claim a jobseeker's payment.  I did it because I want better standards of child care.  I dramatically changed what was going to happen in order to give lone parents in this country two extra years, plus seven years of transition, until the child turns 14 years of age.  It is wrong of the Deputies not to have even examined the scheme or, apparently, noticed this.  I have done this by introducing a payment known as jobseeker's transition to support lone parents with children aged between seven and 14.  It means no lone parent with a child under the age of 14 is required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the State.<\/p>  <p>  Under jobseeker's transition, lone parents do not have to be available and genuinely seeking work, but must engage with their local Intreo office on activation measures, which are based primarily around education, training and experience to help them to be in a position to get better paid work when the time comes for them.  While people will receive a welfare payment and access to the full range of Department employment, education and training supports, they will have a transition period of seven years.  People will enter the scheme when their youngest child is seven, whereas in the North, Sinn F&eacute;in's scheme begins when a person's youngest child is five years of age and there is no transition period.  I do not understand why Sinn F&eacute;in is not seriously examining what is happening here.  It is some kind of cheap populism and an easy target.  The customers will have access to Intreo services and the opportunity to access a case officer on a one-to-one basis to agree a personal development plan.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge and commend the many lone parents already engaged in employment in order to build better lives for their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015063000047#VV01400","speaker":"946"}]
