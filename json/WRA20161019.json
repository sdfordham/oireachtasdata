Obviously OPW cannot hope to maintain a full Guided presence at all locations.  At unmanned sites the objective is to provide site safety so that visitors can enjoy them in their natural state.  As the Deputy is aware, the Carrigafoyle Castle site is in a semi ruinous condition and safe access is not feasible to all parts.  Additionally, it should be borne in mind that the nature of the location and the underfoot conditions at certain times of the year, and in certain light levels, mean that it is not always feasible for visitors to walk the site.  Taking everything into consideration, including staff costs and demands on resources elsewhere, it is not proposed to provide a guide service to this particular Monument at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":33,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB01050"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[22785\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if all provisions from EU directives pertaining to increasing the share of public procurement contracts by small and medium-sized enterprises have been implemented;

This exceeds the commitment in the Programme for\u00a0a Partnership Government in which the Government committed to a split of at least 2:1 and reflects the Government's commitment to rebuilding and investing in public services.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the significant increase in gross voted expenditure outlined above for 2017, Ireland's General Government Expenditure as a percentage of GDP is projected to decrease from 28.3% in 2016 to 27.8% in 2017. It is therefore important when comparing spending in public services relative to the rest of the European Union to take account of\u00a0the basis for the comparison as this can have a significant impact. The Deputy will appreciate that\u00a0the recent revisions to Ireland's GDP level published\u00a0by the CSO\u00a0highlight that the ratio set out above must be interpreted with very significant caution taking account of\u00a0the exceptional factors impacting on the measurement of GDP\u00a0for Ireland. Indeed, the Department of Finance has included an alternate analysis in the Budget 2017 documentation warning against using this inflated figure as a basis for future policy commitments. Furthermore, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population can also impact on the comparisons with other European Countries. This\u00a0is illustrated on page 14 of the  Mid-Year Expenditure Report which shows adjusted public expenditure in  Ireland 2014 (as a % of GNI) being\u00a0above the EU average when  account is taken of defence and age-related expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, for the third consecutive year, the Government was in a position to allocate significant additional resources to public spending with a &euro;1.9bn increase in Gross Voted Expenditure compared to\u00a02016.

This Part, comprising sections 7 to 36, deals with the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its membership, appointment, functions, staffing and other matters including disqualification or removal from membership. The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons. <\/p>  <p>  The selection process is intentionally built around a framework of ten prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act. This framework was introduced by the Government by way of ensuring the independence of the new Regulatory Authority in terms of both its appointment and its functions. It also seeks to represent a balance of interests, in the membership of the Authority, between legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services.<\/p>  <p>  The ten bodies concerned are, the Citizens Information Board; An t&Uacute;daras um Ard-Oideachas; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; the Consumers Association of Ireland; The Bar Council; the Legal Aid Board; the Honorable Society of the King&rsquo;s Inns and Law Society. The Law Society has two nominees reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by five to one &ndash; upwards of 10,000 practising solicitors as compared to upwards of 2,000 practising barristers.<\/p>  <p>  Each of the prescribed nominating bodies puts forward one primary and one substitute nominee for consideration for membership of the Regulatory Authority under the terms and criteria set out in the 2015 Act. This includes by reference to their relevant expertise as set out in section 9(3) and with regard to the objective of there being no fewer than four members who are women and four members who are men under section 9 (6). This is with the exception of the Law Society which, again because of the ratio of solicitors practising in the State which I have just mentioned, puts forward one nominee of each sex.<\/p>  <p>   While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July 2016 with resolutions concerning one remaining alternative nominee passed by the Houses last week. Once the required resolutions of approval have been passed the Government formally appoints the members of the Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The ten prescribed nominating bodies, therefore, put forward their nominees under the procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law. It will, therefore, be for each of those bodies, in the first instance, to identify their nominees for membership of the new Regulatory Authority under their applicable internal governance procedures. It is, for example, for the Council of the Bar of Ireland, as a private body, to competently conduct the indoor management of the Council and to oversee the conduct of its own business in accordance with its own rules and procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications Data","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[31052\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications received by her Department from non-EEA fishing crew members who were already working here before the cut-off point under the terms of the permit scheme introduced as a result of the work of the task force on non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing fleet; the total number of applications received with reference to persons outside of the country; the number of applications approved under the scheme; the number of applications which were turned down under the terms of the scheme; the number of applications which are currently being processed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[31053\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900078#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of employers to date who have availed of the terms of the permit scheme for non-EEA crew members for the Irish fishing fleet; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.<\/p><p>Following the establishment of a task force of Departmental, State agency, Industry and Workers representatives, a scheme was put in place to address the overall situation of non-EEA workers engaged in certain sectors of the fishing industry.

As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually. This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions for the State pension (contributory) are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and there have been a number of changes over the years which impact upon whether someone qualifies or not.  The main such changes in recent years are as follows: <\/p>  <p>  1.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million. While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed an Increase for a  Qualified Adult on their spouses&rsquo; pensions, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.<\/p>  <p>  2.  &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 (i.e. 10 years) and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012. <\/p>  <p>  At the time this measure was introduced, the Exchequer annual savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, but rising substantially on a cumulative basis in the long term.  <\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced, replacing the bands which had been in place since 2000.  While this does not impact upon whether someone qualifies for a State pension, it may impact upon the rate new claimants qualify for, and in some cases may result in them claiming an alternative payment.  The effect of this was to reduce the rate of State pension (contributory) attracted by those on lower yearly averages.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the exchequer savings arising from the current rate bands (relative to the ones in place from 2000-2012) will be at least &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10m annually.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  There has, in recent years, been a significant increase in the number of people receiving a State pension. It is not possible to state the numbers of people who do not qualify as a result of particular changes in criteria, as a significant number would not, as a consequence, enter the State pension system.  Some, for example, might be the spouse of a public service pensioner with a significant income, and might not qualify for a means-tested payment.  If such people do not claim a State pension (contributory) or an alternative, their circumstances would not generally be part of the statistics available to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900080#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":190,"content":"<p>Question No. 85 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900081#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[31047\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900081#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on an application for invalidity pension in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>The lady referred to has been awarded invalidity pension with effect from the 28 July 2016.

GCC wrote to the OPW in September 2016 setting out its proposals in this regard.  The OPW, in reply, confirmed its agreement in principle to the advancement of a potential scheme for South Galway and to provide any technical assistance that the Council may require as the Council will be the Contracting Authority in this case.   Specific funding arrangements have not been set out as it is too early in the process.  Once the tendering process for the required consultants has been completed the Council will revert to the OPW in relation to specific funding requests before entering into any contractual agreements.  If approved, funding will be provided to the Council for the appointment of the consultants to examine options and develop potential solutions to deal with the problem and to undertake any surveys which may be required.  Due to the particular geological and ecological characteristics of the area, the development of a possible scheme will be more complex than is normally the case with a flood relief scheme.  The study area has yet to be defined and agreed and so a map of the area cannot be provided at this time.  The Council will prepare a map outlining the extent of the study area as part of the procurement process for consultants.  Subject to a viable scheme emerging which is both cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable and which meets with general public acceptance, the Council may request confirmation of funding arrangements from OPW to undertake its construction. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the investigation into the problem there will be significant consultation with statutory bodies and the general public during the course of the scheme development where input and knowledge from the local community will be considered very important.

In relation to specific areas of an infrastructural nature which might require extra expenditure,\u00a0as set out in the Expenditure Report 2017,\u00a0it is estimated that an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding will be required for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and\u00a0for expenditure arising from the rescheduling of\u00a0school building works.  This was signalled in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report in July and the inclusion of this capital expenditure in the revised expenditure ceiling for 2016 was\u00a0set out in the Expenditure Report published last week.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, my Department had a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key\u00a0fiscal\u00a0targets in each year of the EU\/IMF programme of financial support resulting\u00a0in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013 and from the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015.  Sustainable public finances will remain\u00a0essential for continued economic and social progress.\u00a0 The reformed Stability and Growth Pact will also be an important aspect of budgetary planning in the future, ensuring a closer alignment of expenditure growth with the medium-term\u00a0potential growth rate of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and\u00a0that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.\u00a0 The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).\u00a0 We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services.\u00a0 When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.\u00a0 It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates\u00a0in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased numbers announced in the Estimates for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In my Statement on the Expenditure Estimates on Budget day I announced that a spending review will take place in advance of Budget 2018.  It is anticipated that this review will provide more policy options on a number of Government priorities.  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, between 2014 and 2017, gross voted expenditure is forecast to grow by 9%.  This is in comparison to three year expenditure growth figures of between 26% and 57% experienced in the 1999 to 2008 period.  A return to such unsustainable levels of increase is not possible.  Therefore, with an ongoing requirement for cost restraint, the systematic examination of baseline expenditure is required to ensure that resources are directed towards emerging and agreed public service priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Policy decisions for a wide variety of expenditure items are informed by an ongoing level of analysis.  An example of this is the work carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES).  Several policy papers were published alongside Budget 2017 and are available on the Budget.gov.ie website.  Furthermore, a\u00a0review of the Capital Plan will take place in 2017.  While the final details of the process for the review are currently being put in place,\u00a0previously this type of process has involved rigorous analysis, both internally in my Department as well as in other Government Departments, on how best to allocate our scarce capital resources in order to achieve the best value for money while also meeting the Government's priorities for economic and social progress.  As set out in the Mid-year Expenditure Report, the Government is committed to investing a further &euro;5.14 billion in the period 2017 to 2021, over and above the amounts included in the Capital Plan published in September last year.  The first part of this additional amount is reflected in the allocations for 2017 set out in the Budget Estimates.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of Departmental allocations being sufficient, Budget 2017 represents the third consecutive year in which the Government was in a position to allocate\u00a0additional resources to public spending.\u00a0Gross voted expenditure in 2017\u00a0is to\u00a0increase by &euro;1.9 billion\u00a0compared to\u00a02016.

Most recently, the new four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association provides for an annual downward only price realignment which will ensure that the prices of medicines in Ireland continue to reduce in line with price reductions across the reference countries. This Agreement is expected to deliver savings of &euro;600 million from IPHA companies, with an additional &euro;150 million expected to be delivered by non-IPHA suppliers of branded medicines.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing has also contributed to significant price reductions. The prices of reference priced products are generally of the order of 70% - 80% lower than the prices paid when medicines were on patent. The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing delivered savings of &euro;47 million in 2014 and &euro;94 million in 2015.  This ensures that generic drug prices in Ireland will continue to fall towards European norms.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these measures, the average price of an item dispensed on the General Medical Services Scheme has reduced to below the price paid in 2001 and the average Drug Payment Scheme price is below the price paid in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  The State also provides a number of supports for persons with the cost of medicines.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:<\/p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;<\/p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  -  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p>  <p>  -  A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage. <\/p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have recently met with the IFA and invited them to present their submission at the next meeting of the Working Group. The Working Group met on the 11 of October and the IFA gave a verbal presentation to the Group. The issue is currently being considered. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900082#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Building Programme","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900082#WRF02450"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[31042\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900082#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide funding for expansion works (details supplied); the discussions he has held in the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>Funding has been made available in the current Capital Plan to bring the project to the design and planning stage.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.   In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA are reviewed and followed up as necessary to ensure all relevant information is available, prior to onward reporting to relevant stakeholders, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA). At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies. The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the condition being treated, a new condition the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  <\/p>  <p>  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine. The review, which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase. The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined. The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. <\/p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information. This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Data","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[31116\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in receipt of home care packages in the Dublin South Central constituency.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[31117\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in receipt of home care packages in the Dublin West constituency.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[31118\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in receipt of home care packages in County Wicklow.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[31119\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in receipt of home care packages in County Mayo.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 139, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02650"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[31120\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900083#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be facilitated with required surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In 2013, the Government published an <i>eHealth Strategy for Ireland <\/i>which set out a digital path for health services improvements. The main objective of the eHealth strategy is to ensure a national approach to ICT and eHealth initiatives.  As part of that strategy, an Office of the Chef Information Officer has been established along with the entity <i>&lsquo;eHealth Ireland&rsquo;<\/i>within the HSE structure to progress the eHealth agenda. The strategy sets out a number of enablers to progress eHealth including the setting up of an eHealth Advisory Committee for the HSE, an Irish eHealth ecosystem and the development of a system of health identifiers underpinned by the Health Identifiers Act, 2014. This Act gives the legal basis for the development and the deployment of identifiers that will cover patients, health care organisations and professionals in the health service. The development and the deployment of the Individual Health Identifier will be a significant patient safety initiative along with being a key enabler for eHealth deployments. <\/p><p>The HSE recently developed a business case for an Electronic Health Record (EHR) for Ireland which is a plan for a consistent and sustained investment over a number of years in technology across the continuum of healthcare in the acute, primary and community sectors. The aim of this plan is to ensure that the right information, about the right patient is available wherever required, in a safe and secure environment. It is envisaged, if the plan proceeds, that the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital will be the initial site for implementation of an EHR in an acute setting thus providing a paper &lsquo;lite&rsquo; digital hospital. In developing a national electronic health record we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment but also the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland. This programme, if progressed, will require a substantial investment in ICT and it also offers the opportunity for re-configuration of services with the potential of a safer, patient centred and more integrated approach along with significant efficiencies. My Department is currently assessing the EHR programme and engaging with stakeholders on how to further progress this programme of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900084#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900084#WRH00450"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[31181\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101900084#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for addressing the serious health risks attached to the use of energy drinks; if the dangers or side effects have been brought to the attention of the HSE or his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>Energy drinks refer to non-alcoholic drinks containing high levels of caffeine and other nutrient which are perceived or actual stimulants like ginseng.
