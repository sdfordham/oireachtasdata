A motion was discussed seeking support for a CCTV proposal for the town of Donabate, a town that does not have a Garda station.  I am aware that Balbriggan would also like to install a CCTV system in certain areas of that town.  The written reply to the request, which was supplied by the council officials, stated, among other things, that at the present time local authorities have been advised to defer any CCTV programmes within their administrative areas until data protection issues have been reviewed and clear guidance from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has issued.  It stated also that it would be premature at this point to commence multi-agency discussions on a CCTV system in Donabate until a clear framework regarding the installation, operation and use of CCTV is available.<\/p> <p>Apparently the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, has issued an instruction or recommendation to all local authorities that all CCTV camera proposals for crime prevention, anti-social behaviour monitoring and, indeed, illegal dumping monitoring and evidence gathering are not to proceed, pending clarification from the Data Protection Commissioner on the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, due to be introduced on 25 May 2018.<\/p> <p>What are the implications of this and what impact will it have on the status of current community and commercial CCTV systems?  Can they continue to operate and be used in crime detection and deterrence?  I presume there is CCTV in the precincts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in the grounds around this building, so what is the status of that under GDPR?<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Minister and his Department for promoting a grants scheme for CCTV nationally.  The recommendation of the LGMA seems to have stalled the roll-out of these existing schemes and is stymieing new applications.  I am aware the Minister issued a press statement on 25 April on this.  The grants scheme provides up to 60% of the capital costs of the closed circuit TV to a maximum of &euro;40,000 and is much welcomed.  There is a great appetite for it.  There is &euro;1 million available each year for community CCTV schemes.<\/p> <p>The garda&iacute; have reviewed these schemes and their effectiveness and have used them in almost every criminal investigation, during major public events and sporting occasions and in the investigation of road traffic accidents.  They are clearly very valuable in bringing criminals to justice and in preventing crime.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely unreasonable that the CCTV system should now be stalled or put at risk by the new GDPR as it is currently being interpreted by some parties.  We are all aware of a famous former UK politician who was on the \"The Pat Kenny  Show\" recently and who said she received a &pound;30 sterling fine for driving in a bus lane and that the ticket was issued as a result of CCTV.  This seems to be a very efficient way of upholding the law.  It is also very important in regard to illegal dumping and I read only recently that the council in Athlone had a debate on this at which one of our Fine Gael councillors raised the matter and asked if Athlone would now be faced a bill for &euro;90,000 for illegal dumping?<\/p> <p>It is very important that we get clarity from the Data Protection Commissioner as quickly as possible.  The detection of criminals and persons engaged in anti-social behaviour and in illegal dumping in our lovely countryside should not be stalled by the general data protection regulation.  We need to sort this out and I would very much welcome the assistance of the Minister in clarifying this matter so that communities around the country and, indeed, in Fingal can benefit from the Minister's new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#A00500","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator James Reilly for raising this important issue.  The Senator will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems.  In pursuance of this commitment, a new community-based CCTV grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in April 2017 to assist groups in the setting up of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.  It is intended that the scheme will run for a period of three years with funding of &euro;1 million being made available for each year of the three year period.  <\/p> <p>Under the scheme, which is being administered by my Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.  The statutory requirements governing the establishment of community CCTV systems generally require that the proposal must: be approved by the local joint policing committee; have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must act as data controller - this is a long-standing statutory requirement set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006, for the setting up of community CCTV systems generally; and have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

It has confirmed it has not issued an instruction to local authorities to refrain from applying to the scheme.  I note all applications approved for funding under the scheme to date have been made on foot of applications made by local authorities.  Furthermore, my officials continue to receive a regular flow of inquiries from interested local authorities on this scheme.  <br\/><br\/>I am aware the County and City Management Association has raised a concern about the role of the data controller regarding CCTV.  However, as noted, this is a long-standing requirement set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 and applies to all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  Furthermore, in the setting out of the grant aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly, including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Attorney General and the Local Government Management Association.  However, my officials are available to provide assistance and guidance to any interested party on the scheme and I am confident the practical application of this legal framework can be clarified for the benefit of all concerned.<br\/><br\/>I take this opportunity to confirm some 11 applications have been received to date.  I understand the Department has been informed a further 14 applications will be submitted before the end of this month.  Four applications under the scheme have been approved to date, with funding totalling almost &euro;120,000.  A further four applications are under active consideration.  The remaining three applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for the grant aid.  <br\/><br\/>Schemes funded under this grant aid scheme will supplement the existing network of CCTV systems in operation in the State, namely, the 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation throughout the State, comprising in excess of 500 cameras as well as the 45 community-based schemes established under the previous grant aid scheme, funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013, encompassing some 367 cameras, to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access.  <br\/><br\/>I confirm I am very keen to ensure all interested groups in both rural and urban areas take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.  Full details of the package are available to download from my Department's website,<i>www.justice.ie<\/i>and officials in my Department are available to provide additional guidance on the application process should that be helpful.

Although it is Government policy to facilitate older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, there will always be a cohort of people who need long-term care.  Quality residential care must continue to be available for those who need it.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for delivering health and personal social services across the country, including at facilities such as Millstreet Community Hospital and Kanturk Community Hospital.  Public residential care units are an essential part of our healthcare infrastructure.  They provide approximately 5,000 long-stay beds, amounting to approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  There are also approximately 2,000 short-stay community public beds.<\/p> <p>While the care delivered to residents in our community hospitals is generally of a high standard, many of these services are delivered in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  It is therefore important that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the capital investment programme for community nursing units.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimal scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The investment programme includes a number of facilities in Cork.  <\/p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that all healthcare infrastructure developments require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  These stages include appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, a review of costing estimates and finalisation of financing.  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that upgrade works have already been completed at Bandon and Bantry hospitals.  Other projects are at appraisal and design stages and are proceeding according to capital planning guidelines.  The community hospitals in Millstreet, Kanturk and Fermoy are currently advancing collectively and are referred to as the north Cork bundle.  A full design team has been commissioned by the HSE estates division.  The HSE project team has also been commissioned to advance the service needs assessment and is reviewing existing layouts and accommodation for regulatory compliance.  <\/p> <p>It is expected that planning applications for Kanturk and Fermoy will be made by the end of the year, with Millstreet to follow in early 2019.  Subject to the successful completion of the design, planning and tendering stages, it is expected that the projects could commence construction in 2020 and be completed by the end of 2021.  The development of Midleton Community Hospital and St.  Finbarr&rsquo;s community nursing unit in Cork city are currently being advanced for delivery by means of a public private partnership mechanism, which is at an early stage of the development.  Unfortunately, it is not possible at this point to give a detailed timeline for the delivery of each stage of the project.  It is, however, expected that the facility will be operational by the fourth quarter of 2021.  <\/p> <p>The national development plan acknowledges the need for additional capacity.  It is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in community nursing units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the health capacity review.  Health capital projects and programmes currently under way will continue and these major priority projects will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the plan for 2018 to 2022.  It is important to recognise that this is a long-term plan which will roll out over ten years and includes provision for a large number of developments across the country.  As is to be expected with a ten-year plan, many proposals are at an early stage and, as with all capital development proposals, will require further appraisal, planning, design and tendering before a firm timeline or the funding required can be established.  Appraisal and planning across all community healthcare organisations, in line with health strategies and demographic needs, will inform the selection of projects for delivery of these new beds and this additional capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#C00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.

I understand it is to do with the referendum, but there is a lot of legislation that needs to be done.<\/p> <p>I refer to Vicky Phelan and her desire for accountability, as she says, and not revenge.  She made some important statements at the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday.  She said that she did not want to die in vain.  She wanted protocols to be put in place, and sanctions for people who make mistakes.  She wanted the HSE to be overhauled from the ground up.  Mr. Stephen Teap, whose wife has died because of this gross mismanagement in the health service, said that mandatory open disclosure was worthless unless sanctions are introduced for those individuals who do not comply.  <\/p> <p>Last week we had a debate on the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016.  I have written to the Minister asking when the Government's proposed amendments would be brought forward.  Again, the Government wants to water down the Bill that was proposed by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 as a result of the hepatitis C scandal.  The most important section of that Bill is section 3, \"Offence of grossly negligent management causing death\", for which a person who should have acted would go to jail for a period of up to 12 years.  The Government wants that taken out of the legislation, because it does not think anybody should be held individually accountable for gross mismanagement.  Why do we think we have these scandals over and over again?  There are people in senior management all across the public service who are not held personally liable for their inaction and for deaths of Irish citizens as a result of that inaction. <\/p> <p>I also ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on, and hope that the Government will bring in legislation to reflect, the latest news from the European Commission.  The Commission is investigating the ongoing scandal in the car insurance market.  It looks like there is some form of collusion between the insurance companies, given the fact that we are paying such high rates for insurance with no real reason or justification for it. <\/p> <p>The cartel the insurance industry and its lobby group appear to be running is affecting businesses and jobs.  It is affecting people's ability to get a car and go to work.  That is how it is impacting on people, and yet the Government is not taking action.  I will give the House an example of an insurance case in Kerry.  My father is an insurance broker.  The issue here is of course the reform of the legal system.  Mr. Justice Kelly of the Supreme Court pointed out that unless one is a pauper or a millionaire one cannot get justice in Ireland.  Anyone in the middle will not be able to afford it.  In this instance three people were injured in a motor insurance claim.  The claim for each of the individuals was &euro;500.  The three claimants got a total of &euro;1,500.  The legal costs amounted to &euro;9,700 and the outlay was &euro;3,300.  The total cost was &euro;14,000, of which 10% went to the people who were injured.  The legal profession got 66%, and the outlay of the legal profession was 22%.  I repeat, 10% went to the people who were injured.<\/p> <p>That needs reform.  We all know that former Minister for Justice and Equality, then Deputy Alan Shatter, was trying to reform that, and bring in a system that made justice affordable for all.  If it is not affordable for everybody, then one cannot get justice in this country because one simply cannot afford it.  That is not an equal society, and I hope that the Leader will organise not a debate but legislation, to address the insurance industry and the cartel it is running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#G00400","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>On this beautiful sunny day I want to bring it to the Members' attention that the Balmoral Show, the premier agricultural show in the island of Ireland - along with the National Ploughing Championships - is taking place over the next few days.

I think of the RT&Eacute; lands at Montrose in Donnybrook.  None of that land was set aside for social and affordable housing.  What a disappointment.

Today marks International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.  On this day, global and state policymakers are asked to consider their progress in eliminating bigotry and prejudices that damage the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex, LGBTQI, community.  During our debate on conversion therapy, I said that we live in a society where many same-sex couples will not hold hands in the street, where \"gay\" is a term of abuse in playgrounds and where mental distress is much higher among LGBTQI people.  This week, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, ILGA, released its European rainbow map, an annual benchmarking tool which ranks 49 countries in Europe on their LGBTI equality laws and policies.  The map also reveals states where advances are not being made at the rate they once were.  The intention behind this exercise is to highlight the lack of sustained progress on LGBT equality issues and it should set off alarm bells for policymakers and advocates alike.  While most of us recall the recent referendum on civil marriage equality and the Gender Recognition Act 2015, it must be noted that this State ranks only 15th among its European counterparts.  The review accompanying the map refers to positive events of this year, such as the review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015, the LGBTI+ youth strategy, Senator Nash's legislation on pardons and apologies for gay men who were criminalised and the election of Deputy Varadkar as Taoiseach.  However, it also states that Irish law \"continues to be conspicuous by its absence from Ireland's statute books of hate crime legislation that protects LGBTQI people\".  This State is the only western European jurisdiction without standard hate crime legislation.  This means, in reality, that we have no way of bringing specified charges against individuals who specifically target minorities with racist, homophobic or bigoted biases.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to discuss his plans to implement robust hate crime legislation in the lifetime of this Government.<\/p> <p>As the House may know, today marks the 44th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. On 17 May 1974, 33 people lost live their lives, which was the largest loss of life in any event of the conflict.  The families and Justice for the Forgotten have campaigned for four decades for the truth of what happened to their loved ones.  The release of British state documents has been the subject of two all-party motions passed by these Houses.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to renew his efforts in seeking these papers from the British Government.<\/p> <p>Last evening, the House discussed the case of the hooded men.  This is another case whereby justice has long been denied.  We cannot become complacent because most of these legal struggles are now entering their fourth decade without answers, without truth and without justice being forthcoming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#H00500","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, at the University of Limerick, UL, of a &euro;47 million investment between Science Foundation Ireland, funded by the Government, and the heads of industry.

That must be examined.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the Balmoral Show, as did Senator Marshall and others.  I have major FOMO - fear of missing out - so I will have to go to the North this weekend-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#K00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The Senator is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#K00600","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I agree with the sentiment that it is a good thing to have businesses, farmers and people from the South travelling to the Balmoral Show at this time, given Brexit and so forth.  It is certainly to be encouraged.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan also paid tribute to Tom Murphy.  He was a wonderful playwright and I had the pleasure of seeing many of his plays.  He was certainly among the best we have ever had.  May he rest in peace.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane paid tribute to Kathy McMahon, who by all accounts was a fantastic advocate for mothers, babies and women in this country.  May she also rest in peace.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris raised an issue involving vulture funds.  Obviously, it is a huge problem.  He also raised the issue of developers putting up prices through price on application.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Davitt pointed out that this is illegal.  We should learn from our mistakes, if nothing else, in this regard.  It is a matter that might be usefully raised on the Commencement in order to get a full answer on this type of activity and what the Minister's response might be to such activity.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield should never stop raising the issue he mentioned.  There were many years in which the issues of homophobia and gay rights were ignored to the detriment of many citizens in this country.  He should never feel it is something he cannot raise as often as he wishes in this House and elsewhere.  It would be a good idea for the Minister to come to the House to discuss such legislation.  I note the comments on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and those families are in need of justice.  I know that all that is possible to be done by the Government is being done in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne welcomed the investment involving Science Foundation Ireland and the University of Limerick.  These types of future projects are vital and very good for the mid west, which is to be welcomed.  Senator Davitt raised a matter with which I am concerned as well relating to illegal dumping.  I know a case where somebody attended a licensed premises and caused a huge fight and was subsequently fired from a job because his employer had access to CCTV from the business.  I am a lawyer and there is a core principle in law and equity that people come to court with clean hands.  The idea that somebody who is dumping illegally is using the data commissioner to get protection from prosecution for a criminal act is really bringing privacy law to a level that was never intended.  Although I have nothing personal against the data commissioner, I am concerned about the office not seeing the wood for the trees in those types of circumstances.  I share Senator Davitt's concerns and it is something we could debate in the House.  He should certainly raise the matter as a Commencement matter at the very least.<\/p><p>Senator Marshall mentioned the Balmoral Show and I hope it is a very successful weekend for all concerned.  I wonder if Senator Feighan has booked his flight to go to the wedding or perhaps the invitation has come in.  As usual, he has come up with positive and innovative suggestions as to how the deadlock in Stormont might be solved.  It is only through continuous international and national conversation and negotiation that this will be solved.  I hope he has a nice time, wherever he goes this weekend.  I am not sure but the Senator might be trying to keep it quiet that he is going to the wedding.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh also mentioned the Balmoral Show.  The Cathaoirleach dealt with the concern about Commencement debates.  It is something about which I will speak with the Leader.  The Senator also suggested having a debate on water and sewerage schemes, and I am sure the Leader can facilitate this.  Senator Wilson raised the electoral (amendment) Bill that would extend the franchise and I do not see any difficulty with that coming into the House.  The Senator also raised the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  As he said, the families deserve justice.  The Senator also mentioned the Balmoral Show so I feel I have definitely been extended an invitation to it at this point.  My interest has been piqued in the show and although it is a very busy weekend with the referendum next week, if I can at all I would be inclined to go up there.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan continues to work on the issues of the North and Brexit.  He referred to the backstop, which is a red line issue for us, as is the Border.  There is continued diplomacy.  Prime Minister May has major challenges and we must hope that in the coming weeks, something positive will arise with respect to the North and this country.  Senator O'Sullivan paid tribute to Mr. Tom Murphy, a wonderful playwright, and mentioned the electoral (amendment) Bill that I have referred to.  Investment in Foynes is clearly important for the mid west and south west, so it must be welcomed.<\/p><p>Senator Devine mentioned another matter on which I have done much recent work.  It speaks to the prevention issue that we need in many Departments.  Ultimately, we would not need incineration or waste reduction if we were not producing as much waste.  The deposit return scheme is a fantastic idea that I have suggested myself.  The big issue is soft plastics, which are completely non-recyclable and cause major problems.  The Senator mentioned that it is about asking producers to find measures to ensure they do not use as much plastic.  It is very convenient for supermarkets to display food in the way they do but ultimately it causes much damage to the environment.  I have asked for a debate on the matter to raise such issues and I would like to see that before the end of term if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#K00700","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526549400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from D\u00e1il","time":1526549400,"counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#L00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has passed on 16 May 2018 the Data Protection Bill 2018, considered by virtue of Article 20.2.2&deg; of the Constitution as a Bill initiated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to which the agreement of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#L00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Childcare Support Bill 2017: Report and Final Stages","time":1526549400,"counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051700002#L00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1526549400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to the House.
