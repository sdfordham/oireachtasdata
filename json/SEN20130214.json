As Members will be aware, the Government yesterday published the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013.  While I have been stating in recent days that the banks are in denial in the context of dealing with real people's problems, it appears as though the Government is in denial on this issue.  Far from the quotations of last September, when the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, spoke of a tax that would be affordable for families, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has complained that people should not be punished for their addresses but that square footage and ability to pay should be taken into account.  Fine Gael's general election manifesto claimed \"an annual, recurring residential property tax ... is unfair\".  However, in a move that is far removed from that and which missed the opportunity that presented itself with the aforementioned amendment Bill, for which Senator Byrne rightly called in his statement yesterday, there is further exacerbation of the problem for the 29% of mortgages that are in arrears, for the huge level of unemployment that obtains throughout the country and for the 50% of mortgages that are in negative equity.  This measure is not affordable for families and is not linked to ability to pay.  This is a tax on everyone in the country and by the Taoiseach's own admission, it will hit middle Ireland most, that is, those who increasingly are being asked to cough up repeatedly.  I refer to a couple with two children who, by the end of this year will lose \u20ac240 in child benefit, will pay more than \u20ac500 between them in PRSI tax and now, on average, will pay between \u20ac300 and \u20ac500 a year on a property tax that is downright discriminatory.  What was wrong with suggestions to impose an additional 3% tax on those with an income of more than \u20ac100,000, who frankly, were conditioned for such a hit in the budget?  However, as Fine Gael would not have that, the Labour Party was obliged to swallow it.  That is wrong.  What is wrong with a tax on off-licence sales regarding the cheapest alcohol that is leading to so many difficulties nationwide?  These two measures would bring in the same amount of money.<\/p> <p>It is not the principle of having to pay a property tax.  Of course that is just in normal conditions, but we are far from normal trading conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400003#B00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>What we need is common sense at this time.

Yesterday, following the efforts \u2013 a little late \u2013 in making it a European issue, the horsemeat crisis moved to a different stage.  I commend, albeit belatedly, the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in this regard.  As I said on RTE last night, I am pleased to see the media today are echoing the calls, the European Union has abdicated its responsibilities in the context of the crisis.  Commissioner Borg has said this is not a food safety issue and therefore the Commission is not concerned and not triggering its normal reaction to the labelling crisis.  That is fundamentally wrong.  There are flaws throughout the country.  Frankly, I have confidence in this country and the systems we employ in post-beef tribunal Ireland in this context.  We have a systemic failure Europe-wide and unless mandatory testing is introduced and enforced by European authorities with clear penalties for those who do not do it, the consumer, who is the person that counts most in the crisis, cannot be served correctly and it might adversely affect our farming industry and European agriculture, in particular at a time when we are about to embark on serious negotiations for free trade between the United States and Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400003#B00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we will have a debate today on the promissory notes.

There was near-unanimous welcome for the deal that was done as it provides for cheaper financing of the debt over a longer period, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the fact that this weekend we will have the second session of the Constitutional Convention.  Colleagues on both sides will be represented at it.  This weekend we will debate a number of references in the Constitution to the place of women in the home and the duties of mothers in the home.  They are highly outdated provisions which are long overdue for replacement.  A whole series of different expert group reports over the years have recommended their deletion and-or replacement with provisions that recognise in a gender-neutral way the important role of carers in the home and the community.  It will be great to have an opportunity to debate it this weekend.<\/p><p>  We will also debate measures to improve the participation of women in politics and in that context we have already passed legislation, which started in this House, to go about improving the number of women candidates in the next general election.  That is very welcome also.<\/p><p>  I note that yesterday there were leaks in the <i>Evening Herald<\/i>, which have been repeated in today&#8217;s newspapers, of the report into the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar in Galway University Hospital last November.  The reports indicate that the account given by Savita&#8217;s husband, Praveen, has been vindicated and that serious errors were made in the treatment of Savita Halappanavar and, in particular, that undue delays occurred in providing her with the treatment she needed to save her life.  We will be able to debate the legislation the Government has promised, which is welcome, on foot of the expert group report.  We have debated the expert group report but I hope we will have the debate on the legislation in early course and that we will be able to review some of the reports into the death of Savita at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400003#B00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I have three questions for the Leader.  Earlier this week I had the pleasure of launching a report on the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, parents in this country.  As outlined in the report, there are children around the country being raised within such families but, unfortunately, the report demonstrates that 46% of participants have experienced discrimination as LGBT parents.  Their overriding concern relates to the legal vulnerability they face.  Many of them do not have legal relationships with the children they are raising within the context of a loving family.  Legislative gaps exist.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has indicated that he intends to address some of the gaps.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House for a debate on wider issues relating to LGBT families and the lack of legal protections afforded to them.<\/p><p>My second question also involves human rights.  It is on the proposed merger between the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  We would all agree that the recent publication of the report on Magdalen laundries reminds us that watchdogs must monitor and oversee the actions of the State in regard to human rights.  Currently, neither the Irish Human Rights Commission nor the Equality Authority have a board.  We have the heads of a Bill.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, when he expects the publication of the full text of the Bill.<\/p><p>My third and final question is one I must raise in light of the recent analysis of the Central Statistics Office statistics on poverty.  Our people are poor and the numbers are going up.  There are 733,000 of them, including 272,000 children.  Who should we invite to the House to debate the matter?  Should we invite the Taoiseach?  Should we ask for the T\u00e1naiste?  Should we ask either of the Ministers with responsibility for finance?  There is no strategy to combat poverty in this country anymore.  To say that increasing jobs is the strategy is too simplistic.  I accept more jobs will help but so much more is needed in order to get people to be job-ready.  We need a whole-of-government response and a cross-party plan to get rid of poverty once and for all.  Why does the Seanad not come up with a plan?  How about a cross-party Seanad plan to stop people from being poor?  I call on Senator Cummins, Senator Bacik, Senator MacSharry or Senator Darragh O\u2019Brien and the Independent Senators to put aside our politics and do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400003#B00500","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400003#B00600","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>In the interests of jobs, to which Senator MacSharry referred, and poverty alleviation, as Senator Zappone has just mentioned, some important events took place this week.  On Friday last the European Council declared itself in favour of free trade between the European Union and the United States and it was endorsed in a state-of-the-union address by President Obama.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, estimated that such a free-trade area would be worth \u20ac150 billion a year and \u20ac100 million of it would accrue to this country.  It might be more because this country has stronger connections with the United States than most countries, both in terms of the investment and our share of exports.  This is an opportunity for us because on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the Taoiseach, as President of Europe, will be in Washington and he will meet with President Obama.  It is a chance to move the project forward.  We should not let it be slowed down by the bureaucrats, as Senator Crown\u2019s proposal on smoking has been killed by them.  I suggested yesterday that the Minister of State with responsibility for research might walk from Kildare Street to Dawson Street to meet the Royal Irish Academy.  The bureaucrats will kill this country if we let them get hold of this project.  Let us set a target that on St. Patrick\u2019s Day the President of Europe and the President of the United States will announce that a third of the tariff barriers will be gone by the end of the year and half of them in 18 months.  Then we could meet President Obama\u2019s target to press on with the project.<\/p><p>Parliament must get radical.  We are being slowed down by the permanent government all the time.  This is a chance for President Obama and the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, as President of Europe, to have free trade between the United States and Europe.  Let us go for it and rule out the delaying tactics and obstacles which will be put in the way of a worthwhile project to generate growth in the economy.  If it would help the Taoiseach to have a debate in this House perhaps the Leader could arrange it.  In any case I call on him to communicate the impatience of elected parliamentarians that we do something radical to address the problem of endemic unemployment throughout Europe and take up the offer made by President Obama in his state-of-the-union address.  Let us have a third of the tariff and non-tariff barriers gone this year and half of them gone within 18 months.  President Obama said that within his term there will be free trade between the EU and the United States.

They noted that one of the reasons America has managed to emerge from the mortgage crisis is the high number of mortgage foreclosures in the US.  I had not heard this view expressed previously and it dawned on me that there is a vested interest involved in this issue because the banks and landlords have a different viewpoint from tenants and home owners.  This may explain the change in the Government's opinion on upward only rent reviews.  To the best of my knowledge, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party both entered government, having given a commitment that the abolition of upward only rent clauses would be part of the programme for Government.  The reason they gave when they changed their minds on the issue was that abolishing upward only rent reviews would not be compatible with the Constitution and, as such, would require a referendum.  Now that the State owns the banks, is there a danger that we are acting in the best interests of the banks, rather than those who must pay rents that are covered by upward only rent clauses?<\/p> <p>It would be worthy to have a debate on that issue in this House.  It appears there are two viewpoints on this issue, one of which was expressed before the election by the two parties in government, in respect of which they have since changed their minds.  We are told they have changed their minds because it has been determined it is not possible under the Constitution to do so.  I do not know whether that is true.  If so, we must find a way to overcome that, perhaps by way of an amendment to the Constitution.

We all know that poverty comes in all shapes and forms.  It is evident every morning in the number of people lying in sleeping bags in doorways, the number of people on social welfare in poverty and the often forgotten middle-income earners who are now the new poor, including prison officers, garda\u00ed, teachers and nurses who simply cannot afford to take any more pay cuts.<\/p><p>I agree with the remarks made by Senator MacSharry in regard to the suggested 3% increase in tax on higher earners, which was ignored in the last budget.  I believe the increase in this regard should be even higher.  We should return to what was done in the 1980s when we also needed money, namely, the introduction of a third tier of income tax of up to 60% on the income of high earners.  <\/p><p>There has been much talk about people on social welfare being exempted from paying the property tax.  I have spoken on this issue on several occasions in this House.  It is regrettable that people on social welfare will have to pay this tax.  We are constantly told by members of the Opposition that it is not worthwhile for people to take up employment because they are being given everything for nothing.  If, as proposed, those on social welfare should be given medical cards and exempted from paying the property tax, then there will never be an incentive for people to take up employment.  The man with 14 children who is in receipt of \u20ac60,000 in benefits per annum was mentioned.  It would not be worth his while taking up employment.  Perhaps it is time the Government considered limiting payment of child benefit to families wherein their are five or six children.  I am not in this regard having a go at children or families.  We must ensure people are incentivised to work.  If we continue to pay people to stay at home we will never achieve anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400006#E00500","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1360839600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Is Senator Kelly suggesting that the property tax is an incentive to work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400006#E00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1360839600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I support the calls for a debate on poverty, the contributions on which have been good.

I would like to hear from the Minister what the Government proposes to do in regard to the ferry contract to Inishmore in the Aran Islands.  While this may appear an unimportant issue to some people, the failure of the Government to negotiate the continuation of that contract has resulted in an increase in fare from \u20ac8 to \u20ac15, which is another example of the affect of hard times on people.  As it was possible for the Government to negotiate the State contract for ferry services between the islands, it is unfortunate it could not do so in respect of the Inishmore ferry service.  I am not in this regard attributing blame as I know the Government sought to renew the contract on the same terms as previously.  I understand that while the service continues it does so at great expense to people.  I would like to think it would still be possible to make progress on that issue.<\/p><p>There is much talk about equality.  While equality is good, our understanding of it can often be overly simplistic.<\/p> <p>Aiken Promotions is no longer facilitating a free carer's ticket for people who attend one of their events with a person with a disability.  This practice used to go on, rightly so, and other concert and event promoters facilitate a person caring for a person with a disability.  The GAA, in particular, has a good record.  Aiken Promotions gave the reason that it seeks to treat able-bodied people the same as those with disabilities.  That misses the point.  It is one of the more positive aspects of society that we recognise people who care for a person with disabilities and offer a particular service.  It makes it possible to enjoy the good things in life and, in recessionary times, we should ensure that as far as possible.  I hope for change in the area, which is one in which the Minister should take an interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400006#E02200","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360840200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>With regard to Senator MacSharry's comments about property tax, it is a bit rich coming from Fianna F\u00e1il to speak about property tax when that party signed us up to a property tax in the troika agreement.

The elimination of the promissory notes last week meant it was a good week for our country and people.  As a people, we can look forward once again with positive expectations.  The promissory notes in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society served as a millstone around the neck of the Irish taxpayer.  This burden has eroded confidence and limited the economy's ability to grow.  The Government has now succeeded in alleviating this burden and placing the State in a position where the debt is more manageable and the State is provided with the space and time to recover and grow.<\/p><p>I note that all respected economic and political analysts have recognised last week's agreement to be the best possible outcome for the country.  This shows what we can achieve as a country and a Government when we work together towards a common objective.  The Government has rid Ireland of the annual 31 March promissory note repayment, has reduced the State's cash borrowing requirement by \u20ac20 billion over the next ten years, has brought the State \u20ac1 billion closer to meeting its deficit targets and has consigned Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society to history.<\/p><p>I recognise that some on the Opposition benches have acknowledged the significant benefits of last week's deal for this country.

However, as Sinn F\u00e9in knows from its experience during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, it is pointless sticking rigidly to a position that will prevent an agreement which is in everyone&#8217;s interests.  Sinn F\u00e9in knows that full well as the party showed through its negotiating realism in not demanding a united Ireland as a precondition in the Good Friday Agreement talks.  This is yet another example of how Sinn F\u00e9in speaks differently on this side of the Border to what it does north of it.<\/p><p>  There are some in this House who seem determined to follow the policy of default no matter what the consequences for those reliant on the State.  The reality is that the promissory notes have been part of the general Government debt since they were issued in March 2010.  They can be seen in all national and European statistical releases since then.  Therefore, a non-payment would have been, in effect, a default.  I and many others have detailed the dire consequences for all citizens of such a policy of default and I do not propose to repeat them today.<\/p><p>  It is worthwhile to revisit the origins of the promissory notes.  The concept of the promissory note was born out of the need to provide IBRC and other institutions with sufficient capital.  In order to minimise the impact that would have had on Exchequer borrowing, a promissory note was issued to IBRC instead of Government bonds.  The promissory notes were by their nature and structure unsatisfactory.  From the State&#8217;s perspective the high interest rate and the amortising repayment schedule placed a considerable burden on the State&#8217;s resources, particularly at a time when the current deficit has to be addressed.<\/p><p>  In addition, they required fortnightly approval for collateral purposes from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank, thus creating a long-term structural liquidity issue for the banking sector as a whole.  From both the Central Bank's and the ECB&#8217;s viewpoint the use of exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, for long-term funding to pillar banks was also problematic.  Exceptional liquidity assistance was only ever intended to be a temporary funding arrangement.  There is little to be achieved in revisiting the decisions taken by the previous Government on the banking crisis.  Suffice it to say that on coming into office the Government inherited an extremely complex set of problems that it had to address.<\/p><p>  The Government has taken considerable steps to stabilise and restructure the banking sector, which have been the subject of many debates in the House.  In spite of calls on the Government to adopt an aggressive approach in negotiations with our external partners, the Government recognised from an early stage that any comprehensive, sustainable solution to our problems, including our banking problems, had to be addressed in the context of an overall European solution.  We have worked hard to rebuild Ireland&#8217;s reputation in Europe and to build momentum behind proposals that are in the interests of Ireland and the European Union as a whole.<\/p><p>  It was clear to the Government that the co-operation and support of European and international partners was essential to reach a solution that is in all our interests.  The Government has always set out clearly that it would not act unilaterally and that it would be bound by agreements entered into by it and previous Governments.  If Ireland is to remain attractive to investors, the State must abide by sovereign commitments, no matter which Government made them.  Our strategy has and is paying real dividends and the recent announcement is a major step in regaining our economic independence through improving the affordability of our debt position and reducing our debt-servicing costs.<\/p><p>  We have been seeking and will continue to seek a comprehensive solution to the remaining structural and funding issues in the banking sector.  Our discussions always had two distinct but related elements.  First, the structural funding issue in the banking system, particularly the exceptional liquidity assistance in IBRC, which has now been resolved.  Second, the matter of investments in the going-concern banks, including AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>  In recent months it has become evident that the complexity of issues around the establishment of the European single supervisory mechanism would impact on the timeframe for achieving a comprehensive solution.  It was decided in that context to progress the situation on the promissory notes as an initial step, and to seek an adjustment of the terms which underpin the punitive promissory notes arrangements.  Notwithstanding that, we will continue to participate in the development of the ESM and the structuring of the single supervisory mechanism to ensure that Ireland will benefit, on similar terms to other member states, from developments in this regard.<\/p><p>  To be blunt, the promissory notes have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Government and the great majority of Members in this House and the other House, but we are absolutely aware of the other part of the equation, which is to put in place and seek support from the ESM on legacy bank debt.  Two important statements stand out for us.  The first is the decision of 29 June 2012 by the Heads of Government where a clear distinction was made between sovereign debt and banking debt, and in the same paragraph the reference to the well-performing Irish programme.  Of importance also was the commitment made by President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel who recognised that our situation is unique and different and issues remain to be resolved in terms of the other part of the banking debt, namely, the amounts of money that had to be used to recapitalise and prop up our banks.  The Government is conscious of that.  Progress is being made in that regard but it is a medium-term strategy because in order for the ESM to be the vehicle through which recapitalisation can occur, and where our issue can be addressed, we must get in place the single supervisory banking mechanism.  That is a key part of the Presidency negotiations.  The other two parts of the strategy are some form of agreement on how we deal with bank resolution and also what kind of deposit interest scheme we must put in place.<\/p><p>  As I indicated to the House on previous occasions, the key aspect is to replicate effectively what the Federal Reserve has across the United States of America.  Europe needs a single supervisory system, in particular for the 17 member states of the European Union that use the euro.  Europe needs the same reserve the Federal Reserve has in the United States of America to deal with banks that collapse.  That is another policy instrument that clearly was not there at the time of the collapse which must be put in place as part and parcel of the recovery programme which will be so important across the European Union.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Barrett's point about the implications, I will go through them because it is important that I put on record where we stand.  The<b><\/b>revised arrangement on the promissory notes is a major step forward in the restructuring of the banking sector, strengthening the position of the Central Bank and reducing our borrowing requirement and debt-servicing costs.  Those benefits, when coupled with making the necessary adjustments in line with our commitments under the programme of financial assistance, will serve to enhance Ireland&#8217;s reputation.  The decision re-establishes long-term stability for a large part of the banking system for the first time since the start of the banking crisis.  The exceptional liquidity assistance which was provided to IBRC, and is inherently short term, costly and unstable, is removed.<\/p><p>  It is clear that all parties to the current arrangements have something to gain from the discussions and from an agreed approach to the restructuring of this issue.  The key objective of any new arrangement was to make the banking-related debt more sustainable in the long run.<\/p> <p>The improved debt sustainability of the new arrangement is testament to the effort and focus of the Irish parties in this matter and to the benefits of the constructive and consensual approach taken with our European partners.<\/p><p>The \u20ac3.1 billion repayment due on 31 March each year served as a constant reminder of the devastating impact that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide had on the Irish economy.  The passing by the Oireachtas of last week's Act means that IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, will be removed from the financial landscape.  The IBRC promissory notes of which the Central Bank of Ireland has assumed full economic and legal ownership will now be exchanged for a portfolio of long dated Government bonds with a maturity up to 40 years.  Over half of all the banking related debt will now be pushed out over 40 years and its burden on this economy will be significantly lightened.<\/p><p>The principal benefits from this arrangement are that the promissory notes are gone, they will be exchanged for long term Government bonds.  The maturity of the bonds will have significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures the liability to repay is beyond most credit investors' time horizon.  There will be a reduction in the State's general Government deficit of approximately \u20ac1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us \u20ac1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015.  Furthermore, a significant element of the interest payments on the Government bonds, which will now be held by the Irish Central Bank, will ultimately be returned to the Exchequer in the form of Central Bank dividends.  The State will borrow \u20ac20 billion less over the next ten years due to the cash-flow benefit of this arrangement, and next year the cash-flow benefit will be \u20ac2.3 billion excluding initial transaction costs.  This arrangement will lead to a substantial improvement in the State's debt position over time and the housing of all the wind-down assets in one entity, NAMA, will result in just one wind-down vehicle.<\/p><p>The decisions announced over the past week involved the following key steps: the liquidation of IBRC, by way of legislation; the assumption by the Central Bank of Ireland of full economic and legal ownership of the promissory notes and all other collateral held as security for funds provided by the Central Bank under various liquidity arrangements; the exchange of the promissory notes in the hands of the Central Bank for long-term Government bonds, with maturities of up to 40 years; and the issuing on Friday of Government bonds that will pay interest every six months based on the six month Euribor interest rate, which stood at 0.369% today, plus an interest margin, which averages 2.63% across the eight issues.  This interest rate is certainly at the better end of our expectations last week.  All remaining debt of IBRC to the Central Bank which is secured by a floating charge over the assets has been acquired by NAMA from the Central Bank in return for NAMA bonds.<\/p><p>In recent days there has been media speculation on a supposed &quot;fire sale&quot; of the assets of IBRC.  I can provide the House with some comfort in this regard.  Put simply, this will not happen.  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a floor price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential can be worked through in the medium-term by NAMA rather than sold to the best available third party at any price. <\/p><p>This Government's approach is consistent and focused on the best outcome for the Irish State and its people as result of attaining yields from this asset.  The success of our programme implementation to date has been recognised by the financial markets.  Our ten year bond yields have remained below 6% for a number of months.  This morning they were at 3.8% and last week they were at 4.1%.  These are extraordinary movements in a ten year bond rate in such a short period of time; when we first came into government they were at 15%.  The blended rate we were lent money from the two EU funds is about 3.3%, we are only 0.5% from full market return.  Once we are below the blended European rates, there is no point holding on to the troika because we can borrow independently.  In circumstances where 0.1% is seen as a seismic change in the cost of Government debt, to see such a reduction is extraordinary.<\/p><p>These collective actions represent a major improvement in Ireland's position.  We have demonstrated in terms of the promissory notes the value of what can be gained from a carefully managed and sustained engagement: the maximum benefit for Ireland.  The Government and the people of this country are determined to recover our economic independence, to recover our pride and self-belief and to create a present and a future free from the excesses of the past and the burdens placed by the few on the citizens of the State.<\/p><p>In bringing these discussions to a successful conclusion, I would like to acknowledge on the record of the House first and foremost the stewardship of the Minister for Finance and the work of the officials of the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance has had a difficult history of late given the crash but it has shown in its negotiating skills the best of the Irish public service.  The forging of this agreement is as much down to their persistence and professionalism as it is to the political work of the Minister on behalf of the Government.<\/p><p>I commend the agreement to the House and look forward to its support in the work it does in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400010#J01700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360842000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him and the Minister for Finance for reaching a stage where there is no longer any doubt that the new arrangement that has got rid of the promissory notes.

This arrangement has sovereignised the promissory note arrangement.  We must keep our eye on this issue.  If another country, such as Belgium, had a banking crash now, the banks would effectively be capitalised directly through the ESM.

I know the Minister of State is working on this but perhaps some sort of similar arrangement could be offered to a mortgage holder to extend the term and reduce the interest rate, allowing him to have some disposable income.

Thankfully, certainty was provided the following day when a deal was agreed that most people consider to be a good one.  We must congratulate those who put it together on behalf of the State, in particular, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, his officials and the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan.<\/p><p>  The deal should primarily benefit citizens.  If it results in &#8364;1 billion becoming available each year, this money should be used to reduce the burden imposed on Irish people.  I will cite figures provided by Senator Sean Barrett.  Since 2008, the tax take has increased by &#8364;9 billion to &#8364;39 billion and is expected to reach &#8364;43 billion this year.  This is a significant increase.  Given that the entire adjustment has been made on the tax side, taxpayers should be given as much leeway as possible.  <\/p><p>  Those who believe this is a good deal include Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau of the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and <i>The Washington Post<\/i>.  Last year, Professor Karl Whelan of University College Dublin, who has provided sharp insights into this issue, calculated that a 40 year bond would deliver a reduction in the net current value of Ireland's obligation of 43%.  The reduction under the new deal is probably a little less than that as the average maturity is 34 years.  However, Ireland will be in a fairly healthy position before it starts to repay the money.  That is the nub of the issue.<\/p><p>  Without meaning to be critical, the original deal was done by the previous Government.  I was not party to it and the House was not provided with much information on the process used to arrive at it.  The front-loading of the payments for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide through the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation was a scandal.  The arrangement was imposed on the previous Government, whose only choice was to accept it or refuse to make the payments and threaten default.  The latter option would have been a high risk strategy and may not have resulted in a better deal.  The scandal came about through the actions of the Merkel-Sarkozy-Trichet triangle, whose objective, it seems, was to teach the Irish nation a hard lesson.<\/p><p>  The Government had to renegotiate and restructure the promissory note deal.  Having achieved this objective, it must make further deals, as the Minister of State noted, on the remaining institutions, namely, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  I am satisfied that a deal will be done on these institutions at some point.  The reorganisation of the existing arrangement with the troika has resulted in a net reduction of &#8364;10 billion in the amount to be repaid.<\/p><p>  I agree that one hour is not sufficient time to discuss this issue.  I congratulate those speakers who correctly described the new arrangement as a good deal.  Those who failed to do so, including the Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson in the other House, are the 12 angry men.  They are getting angrier because they would prefer to retain a bad deal for political advantage and to suit their agenda of carnage, mayhem and chaos.  Unfortunately for Sinn F\u00e9in, the deal has been widely welcomed, with the Fianna F\u00e1il Party, for example, taking a mature and correct position on it.  When one wants to ignore something one wishes they are not important and hopes they will never work.  This deal is important and will work and I congratulate everyone involved in securing it.  If it provides a financial benefit, whether in real terms or on the books, as it were, citizens and taxpayers should reap the benefits. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400012#L00300","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1360842600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  The last time we debated the issue was not, as Senator D'Arcy stated, late at night but early in the morning when the sun had not even risen.  During last week's debate, we finally dealt with the dissolution of an ugly and toxic chapter in our history, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  Members had to decide how to vote on the issue without knowing the full equation.  While it was clearly an historic occasion, it was discomforting and troubling that Members had to vote on the basis of trusting an incomplete scenario.  As I stated on the morning in question, we had to take a gamble, a punt, that the full equation of our bank debt restructuring and, hopefully, some write-down of the debt would be delivered in the subsequent days.  In the end, although the restructuring of the debt was only partial in that no write-down was achieved, none of the reckless activity of the rogue, criminal banks of Anglo-Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, which was underwritten by the previous Government, was forgiven, cancelled or reduced.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Ashoka Mody wrote: <ul>What is the principle that requires the Irish taxpayer to honour the debts of a rogue bank?  The promissory notes deal must not be judged by the relief it provides to the Irish budget [which it does]; the right benchmark for its achievement is the debt obligations that live on.<\/ul>Mr. Mody sounds a note of clarity.  We are in a peculiar, Irish position in this regard.  As David McWilliams puts it, we are a debtor and creditor to ourselves.<\/p><p>  This deal means it will no longer be necessary to make the annual promissory note repayment of &#8364;3.1 million over the next ten years.  The replacement of the promissory note with long-term bonds will significantly reduce the financing needs of the Government and kick the can down the road in the hope that inflation and growth will not overburden our children's and grandchildren's generations.  The total cost to the taxpayer is likely to be &#8364;55 billion over the next 35 years or thereabouts.  We are dependent on growth, job creation and reducing poverty and inequality in society to avoid overburdening our children.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State predicts that the short-term gain will not lead to a long-term cost but he cannot assure us that this will be the case.  What the promissory note deal has done is achieve certainty.  We now know how much we have to pay and how, when and for how long we must pay it.  Anyone managing household budgets can relate to this.  We must now continue to negotiate on the rest of our bank related or legacy debts. <\/p> <p>We must seek solutions that will further improve our debt sustainability, in particular the extension of our bailout loans.  It is a relief that the new arrangements will result in annual savings of \u20ac1 billion in Government spending from 2014 onwards.  We remain in the grip of the troika-imposed reduction of the budget deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015.  This will require further cuts in spending and increases in taxes unless significant economic growth occurs.  There is unlikely to be a significant spike in economic growth, which was initially forecast to be 2.2% in 2013 but is now forecast to be less than 1%.  There is also no sign of an increase in jobs.<\/p><p>I have heard the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, discuss candidly on radio the challenge of mortgage debt and the lack of action from our other banks.  The Governor was sending out the strongest possible warning to everyone that the Government and the banks are not fulfilling the obligation on them to tackle this problem.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State on that issue.<\/p><p>The austerity measures placed on us by the IMF, along with the promissory note deal, mean that we are likely to make an easier exit from the bailout programme and return to the markets.  We now need to realign our emphasis away from the austere philosophy of the IMF towards the profound responsibility of Government to citizens and, in particular, vulnerable sectors of society.  I heard the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, suggest in the D\u00e1il a more nuanced citizen-centred approach.  There is a limit beyond which additional austerity becomes counterproductive.  After five years, we are close to that point.  The IMF has admitted in its staff report that it underestimated the affects of austerity on economics throughout the financial crisis.<\/p><p>Today, the Caritas Europe study on the impact of the European crisis was published.  The first in-depth examination of the impact of austerity policies on people in the five EU countries worst affected by the economic crisis concludes that the policy of prioritising austerity is not working.  It presents a picture of a Europe in which social risks are increasing, social systems are being tested and individuals and families are under stress.  The report's main conclusion is that austerity is not working and an alternative is needed.  It makes a series of recommendations, including that EU funds play a bigger role in addressing poverty and that social monitoring should be put in place for countries in EU-IMF programmes.<\/p><p>According to the CSO, over 700,000 people across this State are in poverty, of which 14.2% are in employment.  The Minister of State spoke eloquently about pride and self belief.  We need to talk about our vulnerable citizens and how we might alleviate their burden, which is directly linked to our bank debt and bailout programme.  Ordinary vulnerable citizens are shouldering these challenges.  I urge the Government to look out for them.<\/p><p>In hindsight and with a week lapsed, I am glad that I voted with the Government to dissolve the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  I acknowledge and congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on his leadership in achieving this significant step towards the unburdening of our debt.

This is an argument that suits certain Opposition parties who want to appeal to a certain cohort of the Irish people who are rightly angry about what has happened to this economy and the lives of ordinary people, but it does not serve the truth.<\/p><p>While this new arrangement on the promissory notes is welcome, it is to be hoped it is only the beginning of wider reform of the European banking sector which will result ultimately in a more sustainable deal on overall Irish bank debt.  Moreover, the decision by EU finance Ministers in January 2013 to consider extending the term of Ireland's bailout loans may be more important than the deal on the promissory notes and could, it is estimated, reduce the State's funding needs by \u20ac43 billion more than the \u20ac20 billion provided for in the current deal.

The previous Administration was supported by Sinn F\u00e9in in terms of its actions on the night of the bank guarantee.

He gradually loses his colour and bits of him fall off in the wind and rain.  Eventually, he is scraped off and replaced by a poster for a different product.  Let us not be the poster boys for anything.<\/p><p>Let us bring our intelligence to play on these economic policy issues.  We should have examined the euro's design faults.  It is funny that Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom read the small print.  Do we have enough expertise in the public service to make sure we do not sign up for something silly when it comes from Europe?  The Minister of State mentioned the reforms in the Department of Finance, which were vitally necessary because we were taken to the cleaners that night.  In parliamentary terms, there should be never again be an incorporeal Cabinet meeting.  It means nothing, with no minutes or record of who was present.  How did people give away \u20ac64 billion, including \u20ac32 billion to the bank the Minister of State was talking about?  We must have parliamentary procedures to defend the Exchequer against that, which is why we proposed that the Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill.  It was taken up by the Minister.<\/p><p>The Minister and Minister of State were very good in remaining here until 6 a.m to go through all the details.  That is a significant change from doing business behind closed doors, which led to so many problems.  What kind of people are the public interest directors of banks?  What kind of people were the public interest directors of the Central Bank?  What was wrong with the Central Bank that it could not see this crisis?  Yesterday, we asked that Science Foundation Ireland take a walk and meet people in the Royal Irish Academy.  People other than insiders have ideas about public policy.  Morgan Kelly should have been involved.  The former Minister, Brian Lenihan, went to see David McWilliams and they had some garlic.  Parliament cannot give away policy to insiders, including the social partners, whose role must be criticised.  If someone goes into the Department of Finance and suggests that \u20ac64 billion would be a start, that must end.  We need more openness and transparency, even though they are clich\u00e9s.<\/p><p>Replicating the Fed may be worthwhile but it is not what we signed up for.  There should have been warning lights in the design of the euro.  Does somebody have a sense of irony in respect of the Central Bank taking over the former Anglo Irish bank HQ?  I hope we paid them zilch for the building but it is a funny memorial to the level of incompetence that applied on both bodies in getting us into this mess.  We must insist on a much higher standard of appointment to State boards and a proper Government economic service.  There must be a relaunch of the free trade initiative on St. Patrick's Day.<\/p><p>Instead of crude, across-the-board cuts in public expenditure, how about analysis and documentation to show that we are dropping the least useful programmes?  How about a capital programme that actually provides rates of return on different projects?  The sum of \u20ac20 billion is important but a lap of honour will be useless.  We have many reforms to do and we must ask how 18 people, which is about as many customers as Anglo Irish Bank had, managed to make themselves a vital national institution.  What appraisals were done?  Let us get this into the open because we cannot repeat the parliamentary, administrative and banking regulation mistakes.  Much institutional reform is required and I have criticised the Government because it has been slow on institutional reform.  Now that we have debt removed, let us see a whole new way of conducting Government.<\/p><p>I would not mind a firesale even though the Minister of State is reluctant.  If someone asks what one did in the recession, one could answer that one got a house in Leitrim for \u20ac4.82.  We should not leave them just there because they are worth something in asset values.  The Minister of State mentioned that the Department of Finance had recovered, which is good because it played a leading role this time.  After the period 2008 to 2010, our public administration and parliamentary institutions must combine with all sides of the House.

The Minister of State has seen the report released today that shows up and magnifies the crisis in Europe and in this State in respect of poverty and employment.  The 2011 CSO figures show that 25% of the population is living in deprivation.  One third of children are living in deprivation and twice as many people at work are living in deprivation.  The low paid, the unemployed and lone parents were hardest hit.  A study on the impact of austerity across Europe concludes that austerity is not working.  Many people are genuinely suffering and have borne the brunt of six austerity budgets.  In that context, we are asking them to pay the debts of a toxic bank.  The taxpayers of this country, the people who have borne the brunt of six austerity budgets, did not borrow one cent of the \u20ac28 billion.  The taxpayers of this country did not spend one cent of the \u20ac28 billion, which is a legacy debt of a toxic bank.  It belongs to the people who lent to the bank and were reckless in their lending.  It is the responsibility of those who ran the bank and mismanaged the situation.  It is not the debt of the people of this State, it is the debt of the bankers and those who lent to the banks.  Why on earth should I celebrate turning toxic banking debt into sovereign debt, which is the ultimate fact?  We got rid of the promissory note, as one of the Government Senators said, but replaced it with a sovereign bond.  The bonds will be sold to the private market and interest will be repayable every six months.  Once they are sold, the interest rate will be determined by the European Central Bank.  We asked this generation and also the next generation of Irish people to pay the debt.<\/p><p>I resent the assertion of the Minister of State that my opposition to the taxpayers having to pay debts that are not theirs is somehow party political or designed to gain party political advantage.  I too have two young children and I do not want them to pay those debts.  I would not ask the Minister of State or any Senator from the Government or Opposition to pay my mortgage.  If my mortgage had 20 years left and I asked the Minister of State to pay it and offered him a good deal to pay the loan over 40 years, would he see it as a good deal?  He would not and that is the central point the Minister of State and his Government have not come to terms with.<\/p><p>Sharp criticism was directed at my party but that is not the view of many people I meet every day of the week.  They are genuinely suffering.  The reports today demonstrate conclusively and show policy makers and Oireachtas Members the level of deprivation and poverty and the impact of the decisions taken by the Government on people who live in the State.  On the day the two reports appeared and explicitly put it on record, the Minister of State is asking me to see turning \u20ac28 billion of toxic dodgy banking debt into sovereign debt as a positive development.  He is asking my children, his children and families outside the Chamber to pay for it.  I will not be part of that and my party will not be part of it.  <\/p> <p> The Minister of State pointed out that the European Central Bank, ECB, sought a separation of banking debt from sovereign debt, but there has been none in this deal.  Instead, the Government turned banking debt into a sovereign bond last week.  This is the reality of the situation.  The Government will not receive my support or that of my party for doing so while imposing austerity budgets that cause such deep hardships for many families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400014#N00400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I call Senator Paul Coghlan, who has three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thought that I had five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00300","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Senator has not been promoted yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00400","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I forgot.  Forgive that lapse.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his overview of the situation.  The arrangements, which were noted by the ECB last week, were the most brilliant financial engineering ever in the State's history.  This is certainly the most significant financial development - I love the smile of my colleague opposite - since the previous Government signed up to the bank guarantee.  As the Minister of State mentioned, where sovereign debt is concerned, it is proper that a Government not renege on a previous Government's action.  It was based on the best advice at the time, regardless of whether we agree with it now.  Like the Minister of State, I compliment all involved.<\/p><p>The promissory notes were a death sentence in every sense of the word.  The State could not afford the short-term annual payments \u20ac3.1 billion.  We now have long-dated bonds and no capital will be repaid before 2038.  God only knows what a Government will do in 2038.  None of us will still be around in politics.  The process will continue until 2053.  An interest rate of 0.36% is an unbelievable bonus, in that it will free up \u20ac1 billion per annum to ease the budgetary situation.  The transfer of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC's assets to NAMA must also be welcomed.  This is an extraordinary turnaround that each of us welcomes.<\/p><p>With the greatest respect to Senator Cullinane, who has left the Chamber, his comments were bunkum.  We will not ask our children or grandchildren to pay.  In 2038, a Government may roll over those bonds into other bonds or so on.  The interest rate is 0.36%.  In the short term and before they are sold, the interest will be paid to the Central Bank, which will return dividends to the State.  I do not understand Sinn F\u00e9in's position on write-downs and defaults.  Do we want to be another Argentina?  No way.  This State has always paid its way and will continue to do so.  We will be frugal and prudent.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Governor of the Central Bank and all of the officials involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00500","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to contribute on the important promissory notes arrangement agreement reached last week.  As Senators on both sides of the House have acknowledged, this is an important step in Ireland's recovery.  The arrangement will make our debt burden easier to bear.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane expressed a great deal of negativity, as have others in Sinn F\u00e9in, but there was a degree of unreality about his comments.  I took a careful note of them.  He stated that the deal had the effect of turning toxic bank debt into sovereign debt, but toxic bank debt had already been turned into sovereign debt through the disastrous bank guarantee of September 2008.  I well recall that all-night sitting, as do others who were in the House then.  Sinn F\u00e9in voted for the bank guarantee whereas Labour and certain Independents opposed it.  The guarantee lumbered us with Anglo Irish Bank's debts, using this cumbersome and expensive promissory notes arrangement to do so.  Under that arrangement, we would repay from public money Anglo Irish Bank's debts to the tune of \u20ac3.1 billion every March, borrowed over ten years.<\/p><p>It does not take a genius to work out the details of the new deal.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, gave a practical example of his own mortgage arrangement.  The new deal allows us to get better terms over a longer period for the same debt.  It does not amount to a write-down, but that was not possible, as we know.  Indeed, the Greek Government had sought a write-down from a much worse financial position and was told that it was impossible.  This deal is as close as we are going to get to one.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden made a point.  I understand why there is an amount of negativity about the deal, particularly on the part of Sinn F\u00e9in and others.  There is a justifiable anger among the public at their forced shouldering of the massive debt burden.  However, the new deal is the best way to ensure that the debt is manageable over a longer period.  Arranging cheaper financing over a longer period and transforming 40% of legacy debt into long-term debt have significantly reduced the cost of financing the debt to the State and its people.<\/p><p>For households, last week's deal means that the gap between revenue and expenditure will be reduced by \u20ac1 billion every year.  We will need to borrow less in the coming years than would otherwise have been the case.  This will have a real impact and will be felt by people in coming budgets.  This must be welcomed.<\/p><p>Any fair-minded and impartial observer must acknowledge the fact that the arrangement's real value lies in the considerable reduction in what the Irish people will pay.  Like many in the Chamber, I have small children and I do not want to see them shouldered with an unmanageable debt.  The deal's effect will be to make the debt infinitely more manageable over a much longer period.  I commend the Government on its negotiation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00600","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1360844400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This deal is another step in the right direction on the road to recovery.  Businesses negotiate all of the time.  To that extent, I see this as an everyday deal, but at a much larger scale.  It gives us a great deal of breathing space, which is what we need now.<\/p><p>I was examining some figures.  According to Mr. Cormac Lucey, we will need to pay approximately \u20ac22 billion less in interest and principal payments in the next ten years under this deal.  That is a considerable saving.  Had we continued along the same route, we would have increased our chances of falling into a devastating debt trap.  While I regret that we did not get an even better deal, as one always looks for a better deal, it is easy to understand the constraints placed on our negotiators.  It is likely that this is the best deal with which we could have emerged, given the strategy taken by the ECB.  Indeed, the ECB is unable to give write-downs.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State has argued, if one defaults, it does not mean that one's debts are gone.  Argentina is still experiencing the effect of defaulting ten years after the event.  As to the argument that we will leave greater debts to our children and our children's children, we must remember the fact that all states are in debt.  Ireland will be no different.  To name one, the United States of America owes a significant debt to China.  That situation will not change in the next 100 years.  However, I accept that a small amount of our debt, approximately 2%, has been written off in this deal.<\/p><p>We are still in a difficult situation and we must deal with a number of issues, for example, unemployment and the mortgage crisis.  In the same way that the promissory note was renegotiated, the customer - the Irish citizen and mortgage holder - should have more opportunities and facilities to restructure debts.  I regret that, apparently, the restructuring under this deal will have no impact on the next budget.  I would be glad if it did or if the Minister of State could dissuade me from believing that there will be none.<\/p><p>We must remember that this pact only addresses approximately half of our bank-related debts of \u20ac64 billion.  I wish the Government more success in tackling the other half, which relates to AIB and Bank of Ireland, throughout 2013.  I hope that the European Financial Stability Facility, ESFS, terms can be improved.  Our Presidency of the EU will help us in that regard.

Not only does the deal provide ease in terms of the methods of our borrowing requirements in the coming years but it will also ease the journey of the many of our State companies which want to borrow on the international markets.<\/p><p>It is important to record the scenario of the price of a house in 1983 and the price of a house in 1980.  I got a text from a young man in the University of Limerick who said that in 1973 the price of a pint was 19 pence.  Incidentally, that was the last year Limerick won the All-Ireland; it could be another 40 years before they win the next one.  The price of a pint today is \u20ac3.85.  That puts things into perspective.  <\/p><p>During the discussion with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, he made a very good point.  He said if somebody told us we had a debt and we did not have to pay anything on the capital for the next 30 years, and we got the interest at less than 1% and we were in business, as Senator Quinn rightly said, it does not matter what the volumes of money are, what matters is the management of that money over a long period.  What we have is a write-down in effect because the value of that money in 40 years' time will blow itself out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400015#O00900","speaker":"1134","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360845000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>First of all, I would not have started from here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400016#P00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360845000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400016#P00300","nonspeaker":"Senators"},{"type":"speech","time":1360845000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I accept that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is a decent, good, highly intelligent man and within his own parameters he has done a brilliant job, of that there is no doubt.

We are not paying debts that we incurred; we are paying the gambling debts of others.  It is absolutely fiendish and disgraceful.<\/p><p>  I wish to quote from an article written by the former IMF mission chief to Ireland in <i>The Irish Times <\/i> yesterday.  He states:<ul>Continued, large budget cutbacks are due through 2015.  Unemployment will remain disastrously high.  Mortgage arrears and foreclosures will continue to climb.  Even if world trade finally picks up, the largely-enclave Irish exports will draw in more imports, providing limited fillip to domestic GDP.  <\/ul>The last sentence of his article is instructive.  He states: &quot;The alternative is unending human pain, [this is the alternative to addressing the legacy debts which are part of the real evil] a culture of national dependency and a fraying European economic and social fabric.&quot;  <\/p><p>  We are dealing with an austerity situation.

That is an appalling situation.<\/p><p>  I have started listing reasons not to celebrate the centenary of 1916 and I will need to add to them all the time and I will continue to do this.  So far we have had soup kitchens, evictions, hedge schools where children are told to jump up and down to keep warm, penalties for improving one's property, what would James Fintan Lalor and Michael Davitt think of that, and now today we have informers in terms of the iniquitous property tax.

The Department of Finance estimates that the general Government deficit will improve by approximately \u20ac1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us \u20ac1 billion closer to attaining the 3% deficit reduction target by 2015.  This means that expenditure reductions and tax increases will be of the order of \u20ac1 billion less to meet the 3% deficit.  It must be pointed out, however, that this has to be taken in light of the general Government deficits of \u20ac8.9 billion and \u20ac5.3 billion in 2014 and 2015, which are envisaged, which means that we will still continue to spend more than we take in in taxation.  We all know that is not sustainable and it will have to be addressed as a matter of priority. That is a priority of the Government.  The deal on the promissory notes will help to bring the public finances closer to a sustainable position and that is what this deal is all about.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste and all the Ministers for their diplomatic efforts.

Those of us who are looking for the magic bullet still have not found it and the task of the Irish Government when we got the mandate we received in the 2011 election was to do our best to renegotiate what was a bad deal for this country, a deal that did not help our prospects.<\/p><p>Many people have been voting and betting against this country in the past few years.  Celebrity economic commentators, the Sinn F\u00e9in Party and those who previously were one of the great defenders of the banks now in the Technical Group have been having a huge punt against this country for the last few years hoping that things would go in one direction because their own personal egos would be helped by that.  They are getting it badly wrong.  This country is coming back.  <\/p><p>I was at the ECOFIN mreting earlier this week with the Minister, Deputy Noonon, where I have the pleasure of calling him Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, as he is the chair of the ECOFIN group, and he enjoys that I might add.  One of things one gleans from speaking to the finance Ministers of the 27 member states is that people are talking about Ireland.  They recognise that we are going to come out of this programme and that we are making a success of our programme.  They talk about the fact that Irish ten-year debt is down to 3.8% where it was 15%.  They know this and that has a huge impact on our country.  As other Senators on the Government side have said, we are not going to get money into companies like the ESB and Bord G\u00e1is and for PPPs unless we can make the Irish sovereign debt issue look less risky.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the support of Senators, and particularly that of the Fianna F\u00e1il Party, for the deal.  The speech of Deputy Michael McGrath, the Fianna F\u00e1il spokesperson in the D\u00e1il was deeply patriotic.  He put the interest of the country before that of his party.  It is important that this be recognised.  The only way to get out of this difficulty is to work together on an agreed strategy, and that strategy is proving successful.<\/p><p>Where did we go this year?  We have got this important deal, but we are not swinging from the rafters in celebration of it.  As Senator Hayden said, it was with relief rather than anything else that it was negotiated.  We know the people were looking for it.  They have suffered badly.  I live in an ordinary housing estate, like lots of other ordinary people, and I see all around me the impact of the current situation.  Decent people cannot find work and their children are emigrating.  I am not in some kind of parallel universe.  Like the great majority of politicians I live in the real world.  We have to work hard for our people to get the country back to a better place.<\/p><p>The deal has been put in place but we have other plans for 2013.  We hope to extend the maturities on the European money, which is two thirds of the total amount we got.  We have already done a deal on the interest rate.  Now we want to extend the maturities on it.  At some point this year, there will be a launch of ten year Irish money for the first time in three and a half years.  If we get two of them over the line we will be, effectively, back to the markets and the outright money transaction, OMT, that Mr. Draghi has been promising us will come into being.  That is success.  We are talking in terms of the banking union later this year.  Only one half of the debt has been dealt with through this issue, but the ESM, through banking union, is the other part of the game.  That kind of incremental progress on a month by month basis will get the country to a better place.<\/p><p>As other colleagues have said, the ECB does not do write-downs.  I was in the room when the Greek deal was done.  It had nothing to do with the ECB.  It was all about public sector involvement and private sector involvement.  Private sector involvement meant the banks taking a haircut and the public sector involvement meant that if a person had Greek debt, they were not going to take any interest on it.  It had nothing to do with the ECB.  Looking to the ECB for something it does not give will not be productive.<\/p><p>I agree with one comment that was made.  The involvement of Mr. Draghi is absolutely crucial.  The legacy of Mr. Trichet was not the best.  I say that in the most diplomatic way I possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400016#P01700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360845600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>You can say that again.

He has been the game changer.  He understands that if we are to get to a better place, we must deal with the debt.<\/p><p>Our debt problem is difficult.  It is about 118% of GDP at present and will max out at about 120%.  The debt problem in every other European Union country is just as bad, or close to it.  The average debt position is about 98% of GDP.  When I was studying economics, I was always told the red lights go off when the debt is more than 90% of GDP.  Europe is in a bad place on debt.  We must work on achieving an agreed solution to which we can all sign up.  That is why banking union is so important and why we are ambitious for a further deal that will help the country get back on its feet. <\/p><p>I appreciate, as the Government does, the support we have received from this House.  The Government will make itself available to this House, to committees and to the D\u00e1il to make sure we go through the detail of this on a constant basis.  We need the contrarian view.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Barrett.  We need contrarians in this society, including Senator Norris, so that we are constantly asked questions.  If we have learnt one thing from this crisis, it is never to take at face value the advice of the permanent government.  We need people on the outside, people in politics, the commentariat and others constantly putting us under the microscope in terms of finding a solution.

The matter relates to the direct provision system and the accommodation provided through the Department of Justice and Equality for people seeking refugee status.  Throughout the State, hotels, hostels, caravan parks and so on are used to house people in this position and that is done in most cases through private contractors who are given a contract by the Department through the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, to provide accommodation, food, etc.  The question I have relates to the ministerial orders that are needed because if a building has been granted planning permission as a hotel, hostel or holiday camp and refugee accommodation is provided, that represents a change of use.  My understanding is ministerial orders would have been necessary to permit these buildings to be used for a different purpose, particularly housing people seeking refugee status.  If the ministerial orders providing exemptions for these buildings have been given, when was the last order made?  Has the Minister checked with his counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the facility for using a ministerial order in this way to change planning permission is still in place or have planning regulations been amended to ensure companies can use these buildings for this purpose as opposed to the purpose laid down for them?  I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400018#R01400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1360846200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  The RIA, a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, of the Department of Justice and Equality, is responsible for the accommodation of persons while their applications for international protection are being processed.  Currently, there are 4,735 residents in 35 accommodation centres contracted to RIA throughout the State.  Of the 35 centres in the State, seven are State-owned, that is, while the centres are managed by private contractors under contract to RIA, the land and buildings are owned by the State.  Details of all of these centres are available on the RIA website - <i>ria.gov.ie<\/i><\/p><p>  The situation regarding planning permissions each of these centres is not uniform and reflects the evolution of RIA's procurement policy over the years, which I will explain later.  Three &quot;system built&quot; State owned centres, which are the responsibility of the OPW, are covered by ministerial orders under section 2(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1993 while two of the commercially owned and operated centres, Mosney, County Meath, and Balseskin, in St. Margaret's, County Dublin, are also covered by such ministerial orders.<\/p> <p>The remaining 30 centres comprise four State-owned centres, which originally operated as hotels and hostels, and 26 commercially owned and operated centres.  These operate on the basis of their own planning permissions, which are subject to compliance procedures from the relevant planning authority.  The commercially owned centres are subject to a standard clause in the contracts with the RIA which states, \"It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that the premises complies and operates in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of Local Authorities and other Agencies in relation to planning, building bye-laws\".<\/p><p>The ministerial planning order, issued 14 June 2001, for Balseskin arose because the centre was commissioned, built and operated specifically as a reception centre for asylum seekers following a tender competition run by the OPW.  The issuing of a ministerial planning order for this commissioned centre was necessary given the urgency of the situation then prevailing with the number of asylum seekers arriving in the State.  Similarly, given the pressing need for bed spaces and the size of the centre being contracted - and it remains the biggest centre - it was decided to issue a ministerial planning order in respect of Mosney.  This issued on 30 November 2000.  For a more detailed account of the procurement and planning processes in operation at that time, I commend to the Senator chapter 4 of the 2002 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which is in the Oireachtas Library.<\/p><p>In explaining the history of the RIA's procurement policy from the start of the direct provision system, it would be wrong to ignore the salient point that, in many cases, asylum accommodation centres are not welcomed initially by local communities.  Controversy and significant local opposition arose almost immediately in respect of some of these properties - both State and commercially owned -with some local communities expressing fears about the arrival of asylum seekers in their neighbourhoods.  In certain instances, local residents exercised their right to challenge the use of the properties through the courts on planning grounds.  Such opposition was particularly costly in the context of the procurement of State-owned centres.  The last State-owned property procured by RIA was Atlas House, a hostel in Killarney, in January 2002.  Since then, RIA policy has been to procure commercial properties such as hotels, hostels and boarding colleges from private operators through public advertisements seeking expressions of interest.  As already explained, this involves existing premises in the private sector where the contractor is required to operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements, including those relating to planning.<\/p><p>The Minister is of the view that the direct provision system is a necessary component of the State's immigration policy and that the ministerial planning orders are still required.  Plainly, if RIA and the OPW were to consider new State-owned centres, or replacing buildings in existing State-owned centres, then legal advice would be sought on whether the use of the ministerial orders referred to would remain appropriate.<\/p><p>It is worth noting generally the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation in the RIA system in recent years, which has necessitated the consolidation of the accommodation portfolio.  At the end of 2008, RIA was accommodating 7,002 persons in 60 centres.  At the end of 2012, the RIA was accommodating 4,841 persons in 35 centres.  During that four year period RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons.  In the same period, spending on the RIA system declined from \u20ac91.5 million to \u20ac62.3 million, which is a reduction of 32%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400018#R01500","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360846800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

I am not opposed to paid parking in all circumstances as it makes sense in certain cases.  In Malahide it was the businesses which sought the introduction of paid parking because they were having a problem with people parking for the entire day which made it impossible for shoppers and visitors to park for short periods during the day.  It also makes sense in Dublin city centre for the same reason, as there is a shortage of spaces and one needs to free them up to give the maximum number of people an opportunity to use them.  This is absolutely not the case in Howth.  Apart from a few fine days during the summer, there is never a problem with parking on the harbour.<\/p><p>Not only is it unnecessary to introduce paid parking in Howth, it would have a major negative impact on the area and put people off travelling there to shop in marine businesses such as fishmongers, restaurants and other retail businesses in the village.  It would put people off travelling out to walk the pier and Howth Head and to use the marine resources.  Marine leisure is a huge draw for Howth.  Howth Yacht Club is the biggest water sports club in Ireland with 1,700 members.  People go scuba diving, sea kayaking and angling in Howth.  It has a wide range of water sports and has become more popular in recent years.  A huge amount of activity takes place there.  One of the reasons it is so attractive to such a wide range of users is because of the free parking.  It is a difficult enough place to reach and is somewhere people go for the day.  People do not pop in and out for half an hour but make the journey to spend the day.<\/p><p>I have tabled this Adjournment matter to raise this issue, which came as a shock.  It is contrary to the marine development plan of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which was launched by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, the first key objective of which was stakeholder consultation whereby people would be asked when major decisions would be made.  Local businesses were shocked to discover this was being considered without any consultation having taken place.  Rumours had been circulating for months that it was being considered.  It then emerged the local authority and the Garda had been asked for their views on an informal basis but local businesses had not.<\/p><p>There is huge opposition to the proposal.  Representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine met some harbour users on 7 February and the points I have made were articulated strongly by a wide range of groups.  Written submissions have been made by the yacht club, the sea kayaking club and the Howth Sutton Baldoyle chamber of commerce and the Howth Sutton community council.  There is a wide range of opposition to the proposals.<\/p><p>I have written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on this and I am awaiting a detailed response outlining the logic behind this.  Has a cost-benefit analysis of the proposal been conducted?  As I have outlined, there are many reasons to be against its introduction in terms of the impact on businesses, community groups and a wide range of users.  It seems the only potential logic, if there is one, is that it would make money, but no evidence has been put forward to show this is the case.  We know where paid parking has been introduced in other villages and towns throughout the country that it has been a disaster and one in three schemes is losing money.<\/p> <p>It has been reported that local authorities around the country are losing millions of euro due to pay parking.  There are many reasons against it and no case has been put forward to any of the interest groups that have been in touch with the Department showing that a proper feasibility analysis and cost-benefit analysis have been carried out.<\/p><p>Have such analyses been carried out by the Department?  If so, what is the estimated income and on what charging structure, for example, hourly and daily rates, is that estimate based?  What is the estimated cost of operating the system?  Installing parking meters incurs a significant start-up cost and the ongoing cost of policing the system needs to be taken into account.  Has an analysis of the likely loss of revenue to the State from other sources been conducted?  Undoubtedly, Howth's struggling businesses will be driven out of business by extra charges.  Jobs will be lost.  Have these factors been taken into account?  Has the experience in other areas been considered?  In D\u00fan Laoghaire, for example, the Irish Sailing Association has written to the Department highlighting the problems brought about by the introduction of pay parking.<\/p><p>If the Minister of State cannot tell me whether such an analysis has been done, it will be shocking.  Such a significant decision should only be based on proper research and analysis.  However, if an analysis has been done, will it be published so that the stakeholders can see the rationale on which the Department has based its decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400019#S00500","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360847400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I convey the Minister, Deputy Coveney's regrets for being unable to be present.  In terms of the issues raised and to set the context, Howth is one of six fishery harbour centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  Howth fishery harbour is, first and foremost, a working fishery harbour.  As such, commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and the various ancillary enterprises requires full access with appropriate parking arrangements.  Social harbour users such as the yacht club and others also require reasonable access to parking.  A large number of parking spaces in the fishery harbour are currently being taken up by commuters using the nearby DART service during the working week.<\/p><p>All users need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility.  It is generally acknowledged that traffic and parking management within the fishery harbour centre needs to be addressed, particularly in light of the concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coast Guard, the life boat service and the Garda.  The introduction of pay parking is only one of a number of measures being introduced to address these concerns.<\/p><p>There has been significant capital investment in the fishery harbour centres in recent years, underpinning the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both respects.  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, the Minister's Department is required to ensure that the fishery harbour centres are run on a financially sound basis.  It is in these contexts that he is giving consideration to the introduction of a charge for parking facilities within Howth fishery harbour centre, just as a charge is made for using any other of its facilities.<\/p><p>As provided under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968, all income generated by the fishery harbour centres goes into a ring-fenced fishery harbour centres fund that is used exclusively for day-to-day operating, management and development costs.  It is the only source of income available for this purpose.  Without it, fishery harbour centres would not function and could not provide a service to their customers, namely, the harbour users and the visiting public.  In the Minister's opinion, it is illogical that some harbour users would expect to continue to use such a facility free of charge while other harbour users, those who are already paying into the fund for using the harbour facilities, are effectively paying for its upkeep.<\/p><p>The introduction of pay parking at Howth fishery harbour centre was originally examined in detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth traffic and parking management plan in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  The Senator has undoubtedly seen that report.  However, the plan did not proceed.  There was widespread public consultation at the time and all of the various views expressed and submissions made are still on file.  The Minister is well aware of the concerns as then expressed and is in receipt of new correspondence on this matter on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Departmental officials have formally and informally met officials of Fingal County Council's operations department regarding the plans to introduce pay parking as well as other traffic management enhancements.  Officials have also met the Garda about this and other related matters and Department engineers have met some of the harbour's business tenants individually about new traffic management, road markings, etc.  Departmental officials also attended a recent harbour users forum where pay parking was on the agenda.<\/p><p>The current rates and charges order, SI 214 of 2012, provides for a charge for parking in the fishery harbour centres.  No tariff has yet been fixed for Howth, but with approximately 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the fishery harbour centre, it is clear that a source of revenue exists in the form of this State asset, which was not provided and cannot be maintained for free.<\/p><p>A detailed scheme for pay parking is being developed by departmental officials and the Minister is determined that it will be fair to all users of the harbour while ensuring that everyone pays a fair share.  I do not doubt that the Minister has carried out due diligence in terms of a cost-benefit analysis or that the report will be on file with Fingal County Council.  The new parking arrangements will include pay and display parking for harbour visitors and a permit management system for business users.  Regular harbour users will have noticed that all currently available parking spaces have been identified and marked recently.<\/p><p>The Department has asked the planning department of Fingal County Council for guidance on the latter's requirements concerning possible environmental and visual impacts of pay and display machines and associated directional signage and will be pleased to take account of any requirement and recommendation the planning department might have.<\/p><p>The additional revenues to be generated from pay parking at the Howth fishery harbour centre will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible, given the current financial constraints.  These improvements can only be of benefit to the marine and leisure tourism sectors and local economies in general.  In the long term, the Minister believes that harbour users and Howth people in general will recognise the benefits that will accrue from this previously untapped resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400020#T00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1360847400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and reply.

It is laden with language about the principle that users should pay, but the logic of a cost-benefit analysis is not evident.  There is no evidence that the Department has considered the real cost of introducing charges.<\/p><p>As with previous responses from the Department on this issue, the Minister of State's reply focused on the marine aspect.  While I appreciate that this is the main focus of the Department of the marine, we are supposed to have a whole-of-government approach.

Ironically, its success has led to organ shortages and so it is important for all concerned to highlight the enormous benefits to patients of organ transplantation and to create a greater awareness of the continuing need for people to become organ donors.  The programme for Government envisages the introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation, with a view to improving the availability of organs for patients in need of transplantation.  This will of course require detailed consideration and further consultation, and the Minister for Health is developing proposals for Government on this matter.<\/p><p>In addition to consent systems, there is evidence from other countries that good co-ordination at hospital level and counselling arrangements for relatives are significant factors in achieving high organ donation rates.  In conjunction with the HSE's national organ donation and transplantation office, the Minister for Health is considering what practices and organisational changes could further improve donation rates in this country.  This office is developing a plan for the introduction of changes and improvements in donation and transplantation systems and practice so that as many patients as possible benefit from a proactive and successful programme of organ donation.

Directive 2010\/53\/EU, which was transposed into Irish law in August last year, sets standards of quality and safety and will help to minimise the risks of transmission of disease and to protect the health of organ recipients.<\/p><p>I assure the House that the Minister for Health and his Department will continue to work in collaboration with the HSE, voluntary organisations and health professionals to raise awareness of organ donation and to enhance donation and transplantation rates for both living and deceased donors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400021#U01100","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1360848000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for a very comprehensive response.

I will take the Senator's observation directly to the Minister.  I assume the HSE is included, although the reply does not indicate that the executive is involved.  Within the hospital structure, the HSE would be a delivery mechanism.  I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is holding a meeting on Monday, and the use of the new driving licence is very good news.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is also considering the use of an indication of donor intent on the social welfare card, which is also positive news.  People can be instantly aware if a person is prepared to be an organ donor.  I have no doubt the Senator will speak to the Minister directly but I will raise his concerns as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400021#U01300","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1360848000,"counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400021#U01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1360848000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I raise this issue on foot of a news report from last week or the week before concerning a young person who had a cochlear implant inserted and who had to wait four years to have a second implant put in.  The report indicated that Beaumont Hospital made a submission to the Department of Health for funding in order to do both ears at one time when treating a young person.<\/p> <p>It seems highly unusual and unacceptable to me that a hospital would carry out an operation to implant one device into a child's ear yet wait four years to do the second ear.  By then the child will have developed and his or her hearing will have developed in certain ways.  The time between both procedures is not best practice.  On making inquiries it turned out that such delays happen but that is unacceptable.  It makes sense to treat both ears at the same time.  I am sure that there is a waiting list to get the first treatment done.  It makes medical and economic sense to implant a device in both ears at the one time thus leading to a greater improvement in the child's hearing.  This is a no-brainer.  No one should have to wait years to have a second device implanted and I hope that the Minister of State will have a positive response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400021#U01500","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360848600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Yesterday the Taoiseach comprehensively dealt with the matter in the D\u00e1il and I thank the Senator for raising this important matter in the Seanad.<\/p><p>Beaumont Hospital is the centre for delivering Ireland's national cochlear implant programme with surgical provision for patients under six years of age carried out in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  Beaumont Hospital's annual budget for provision of the service, inclusive of implants, is \u20ac4 million.  Since the programme commenced 17 years ago over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.  I am advised that Beaumont Hospital carried out 90 cochlear implants in 2012 so 48 adults and 42 children received implants.<\/p><p>In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.  There are three target groups that could benefit from cochlear implantation: prelingually severely or profoundly deaf children from one year to five years of age; post-lingually severely or profoundly deaf children from six to 17 years of age; and post-lingually deafened adults.<\/p><p>There is good evidence on the benefits of cochlear implantation and on the added benefit of bilateral implantation for children.  In 2009 the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, NICE, recommended simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation as best practice for children.  The HSE undertook a national review of audiology services.  The group was tasked with examining the services provided to children and adults nationwide and with formulating a national plan for the service.  The report was published by the HSE in 2011.  It provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services from newborn screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations include the national roll-out of a universal newborn hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme.  The report included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.<\/p><p>Since then, the HSE's audiology clinical care programme was formed to oversee the implementation of the recommendations detailed by the report.  Progress is being made on the modernisation of audiology services in Ireland, with the introduction of a universal national programme of newborn hearing screening a key priority.  It will ensure that all babies have their hearing screened shortly after birth.<\/p><p>While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out here at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant.  Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of the all the issues involved.<\/p><p>The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.  The hospital, HSE management and the HSE's audiology clinical care programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.  These plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400022#V00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1360848600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013021400022#V00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1360848600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 1.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 February 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
