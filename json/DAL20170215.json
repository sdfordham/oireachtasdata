Trump on 27 January 2017.  In particular, I wish to make clear the Government's position on the following three issues: the executive order, the operation of pre-clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon airports, and Ireland's relationship in broader terms with the United States of America.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's position on this matter is clear and was set out in my press statement of 29 January 2017, immediately prior to my visit to Washington, D.C., from 31 January to 2 February.  As I noted in that statement, while US immigration policy is a matter for the US authorities, it is clear that the executive order signed by President Trump on 27 January could have far-reaching implications, both on humanitarian grounds and for relations between the US and the global Muslim community.  I further noted that the Government fully shares the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside these concerns, a question arose about the possible effects on dual nationals.  On 31 January 2017, the US authorities issued a clarification, which was also publicised by the US Embassy in Dublin.  This noted that the executive order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the US so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  This means that Irish citizens travelling to the US on Irish passports should encounter no difficulties in this regard as long as they have followed the relevant procedures governing the US visa waiver programme and, if necessary, have obtained a US visa prior to travel.  I wish to underline that Irish citizens who are dual nationals of one of the seven states listed in the executive order of 27 January have the same rights to avail of the US visa waiver programme as all other Irish citizens.  A total of 5,003 certificates of naturalisation were issued in the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 to citizens of the seven states concerned.  Around 8,000 current Irish passport holders were born in one of these seven countries.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, I visited the US from 31 January to 2 February 2017 as part of a pre-planned visit to Washington, D.C.  I had a number of meetings with several congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle - that is, both Republican and Democrat - including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan; the House Majority Leader, Mr. Kevin McCarthy; and the House Minority Leader, Ms Nancy Pelosi.<\/p>  <p>  I also travelled to the White House, where I met with representatives of the US Administration, including the former US National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn.  During my meeting with General Flynn, I expressed the Government's deep concern regarding the nature and impact of the executive order of 27 January.  In response, General Flynn outlined the rationale, in US immigration terms, for these temporary measures.  I also pointed out to General Flynn the damaging consequences of these measures in humanitarian terms, as well as the impact on the international reputation of the USA.  I reiterated these views and concerns at my various meetings on Capitol Hill.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will no doubt be aware, in recent days the US courts have intervened and imposed a temporary suspension on the implementation of the executive order of 27 January.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter, which is still the subject of legal proceedings in the United States.<\/p><p> I will now turn my attention to pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports.  In the context of discussions about the executive order in Ireland, the issue of pre-clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon airports arose.  The matter was discussed at Cabinet and the Taoiseach requested that a review of pre-clearance be carried out.  This review, which is being chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Justice and Equality and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I understand that the review is very close to completion.  However, I would like to clarify the facts regarding a number of questions that arose about pre-clearance facilities.  The US-Ireland pre-clearance agreement was signed by the then Minister for Transport and the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security on 17 November 2008 and given effect in Irish law on 8 July 2009 by the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009 (No. 16 of 2009).  The US, Ireland pre-clearance agreement states that nothing therein diminishes the rights enjoyed by individuals under the Constitution and laws of Ireland or, where applicable, the United States of America.  It expressly states that the pre-clearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and that the laws of Ireland apply at all times.  US pre-clearance officers are not considered law enforcement officers.  The only law enforcement officers at Irish airports are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and customs officers.  From an operational perspective, facilities are provided to US border and customs staff to operate the facility and normal Garda assistance is available to passengers and US staff in these areas.<\/p> <p> Passengers who wish to avail of pre-clearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse pre-clearance in accordance with its laws.  Passengers present voluntarily for pre-clearance and avail of the facility on a consensual basis.  Until their flights depart, passengers remain in Irish legal jurisdiction and have the right to withdraw from the pre-clearance process at any time.  If an individual is refused leave to board, he or she reverts to the Garda immigration officer and is considered in the same manner as if he or she had presented at the frontier of the State seeking permission to enter.  Each case is examined on its own individual merits, in accordance with Irish law.  The existence of pre-clearance facilities, therefore, has no effect on the capacity of persons to claim asylum in Ireland or on the way such individuals are treated.  I would like to remind the House that pre-clearance of flights from Dublin or Shannon bound for destinations in the United States is not a compulsory regime.  Air carriers choose to apply to have their services pre-cleared in either Dublin or Shannon..<\/p> <p> It is important to have clear factual information about pre-clearance in the public domain given its considerable benefits for Ireland.  Shannon Airport was the first airport in the world outside the Americas to offer a US pre-clearance facility.  Over 204,000 passengers used the pre-clearance facility at Shannon in 2016.  Pre-clearance is a major selling point for the airport&rsquo;s business and tourism customers, supporting transatlantic connectivity for its catchment area along the entire western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry and also serving the midland counties.  During 2016, almost 1.2 million passengers used the pre-clearance facility at Dublin Airport.  Dublin Airport has seen continuous growth in transatlantic flights since the commencement of pre-clearance in 2011.  Pre-clearance has been a key driver of transfer growth at Dublin Airport.  Dublin Airport is the fifth busiest airport for connectivity to North America in Europe, behind Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol.  The availability of pre-clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon airports is a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s continued competitiveness in attracting US foreign direct investment and Ireland&rsquo;s position as a gateway to the wider EU Single Market.  It is worth noting in this context that the US is currently expanding the pre-clearance programme, with ten airports short listed as potential sites.<\/p> <p> I will now deal briefly with the broader issue of relations between Ireland and the United States.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the long-standing and warm relationship between Ireland and the US is protected in the interests of Irish citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.  Our relationship is complex and multi-layered and is based on shared values, as well as our deep political, historic and economic ties.  In economic terms alone over 150,000 people are directly employed in over 700 US firms in Ireland and these account for over 74 % of all IDA Ireland-supported employment.  In addition, Irish companies directly employ over 120,000 people in 227 companies at over 2,600 locations in all 50 states across the USA.  US firms in Ireland form a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s cutting edge, internationally traded goods and services economy in industries such as information and communications technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and financial services.<\/p> <p> As a Government, we have a responsibility to protect and advance the interests of our country and our people.  As the House will be aware, the Taoiseach was the first EU Head of State or Government to speak to then President-elect Trump immediately following his election on 8 November last.  The Taoiseach also spoke to then Vice President-elect Pence, who has strong links with Ireland.  Separately, I spoke to Mr. Paul Ryan following his re-confirmation as Speaker of the House of Representatives in November.  Following the US presidential elections, there was some public debate about St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events, specifically those in Washington DC.  Collectively, the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in Washington provide invaluable opportunities for the Government to discuss, at the very highest levels with the US Administration, its concerns, priorities and interests.  It is also an opportunity to inform the new administration and the US Congress of issues of Irish interest, including immigration reform and the peace process and to reaffirm our long-standing relationship which is based on shared values of democracy and the rule of law, as well as our long-standing historical and economic ties.  St Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers the Government the opportunity, in a spirit of honest friendship, to raise its concerns with the US administration as well as to honour the long-standing relationship between our two countries and peoples.  The tradition dates back several decades and has facilitated contact with both Republican and Democrat administrations.  It is a key date each year in our multifaceted bilateral relations.  Indeed, President Trump, Vice President Pence and Speaker Paul Ryan have all indicated that they wish to continue with the tradition of marking St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Washington, DC.<\/p> <p> As I have already noted, I visited Washington from 31 January to 2 February last and met Speaker Paul Ryan, house majority leader Kevin McCarthy and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as a large number of members of Congress and representatives of the administration.  Our ongoing engagement with US political leaders from both sides of the aisle is essential in advocating on issues of interest or concern to the Irish people and I would like to publicly thank the Congressional Friends of Ireland for its ongoing commitment to our country.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am acutely conscious of the challenges facing the undocumented Irish in the United States.  Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and reaching agreement on a facility for future migration between Ireland and the US are long-standing Government objectives.  The undocumented Irish in the United States are believed to number around 50,000 individuals, spread across the US, in each state.  My Department has and will continue to seek practical, beneficial solutions to the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will also continue to support organisations that deliver front-line advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the emigrant support programme.  In this regard, I wish to acknowledge the leadership and ongoing commitment of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who has specific responsibility for the diaspora.  Many emigrants to the United States achieve great success but many others can find themselves in vulnerable circumstances.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish In the US.  In the last funding round for the emigrant support programme, my Department was able to allocate more than &euro; 2.3 million to organisations in the United States.  I have visited immigration centres and know that this funding makes a valuable contribution to vulnerable Irish citizens far from home and their family networks.  I commend the ongoing work of the Minister of State in that regard.<\/p> <p> During my recent visit to Washington, I had an opportunity to be fully briefed by our ambassador to the United States, H.E. Anne Anderson, and her colleagues at our embassy on a range of issues of importance in our bilateral relations with the United States, including immigration reform.  Indeed, my officials regularly update me on this priority issue for the Irish Government, which the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and I, along with all of our Government colleagues, are dedicated to progressing with a view to reaching a satisfactory conclusion.<\/p><p>Our embassy in Washington and consulates across the United States remain in active and ongoing contact with Irish immigration centres throughout the US.  The Irish ambassador to the US, Anne Anderson, hosted a meeting of stakeholders in the area of immigration at the Irish Embassy on 12 January 2017 for an exchange of views on how progress might best be made in the context of the new political administration, and to underline the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to those working with Irish immigrants in the United States.<\/p> <p> For me and the Government, the bottom line is that it is only by continuing to engage with policy-makers in the US - in the Administration and in Congress, as well as at State and local level - that we can articulate our concerns and seek to advance the interests of Irish citizens, whether it be with regard to the recent executive order or concerning the need for immigration reform.  As a Government we are determined to use every opportunity to set out our priorities on a broad range of issues, in the interests of our people, and on the values which both Ireland and the US share across a number of pursuits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500003#A00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is useful to have these statements here today.  I will move on to the content of the Minister's contribution shortly, but I first want to point out that it is unfortunate we are not actually debating a motion today.  Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il had submitted a motion that was agreed.  I know the Government and most of the other parties in the D&aacute;il - the Green Party, the Labour Party and Fine Gael - had attempted to do that in order for the D&aacute;il to speak as one voice.  I wish to put on the record that misinformation was given in the D&aacute;il last week by Deputy Ruth Coppinger of the AAA-PBP, that it was all of us who had in some way stopped this motion being put forward.  In truth it was the six AAA-PBP Members who would not agree to a cross-party motion because they felt they would reserve the right to amend the motion at any stage.  That is the reality and that is why this morning we are making statements as opposed to actually dealing with a motion where the House could have spoken with one voice.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his contribution this morning and the detail therein, very little of which I would disagree with.  The Government's approach to the controversy around the executive order has been very well handled and well considered.  Fianna F&aacute;il is completely opposed to the executive order that was issued by President Donald Trump, which includes the 90 day travel ban by people from seven Muslim majority countries, the 120 day freeze on admission of any refugees into the United States and an indefinite halt to admitting any refugees from Syria.  As I have said, Fianna F&aacute;il and our colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in have put forward a detailed motion condemning the executive order and asking the Government to convey these concerns and to write formally to the US President seeking its repeal.  We feel the ban is morally wrong, discriminatory and prejudiced.<\/p>  <p>  While we are opposed to the executive order, we are fully committed to maintaining our pre-clearance capabilities and our diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US, and to continue in improving them.  Pre-clearance, as we know, is carried out by US authorities in Dublin and Shannon airports.  I am very familiar with the Dublin Airport pre-clearance facility in my constituency and the importance of it since 2009.  It is of great benefit to Ireland in improving investment and travel between both countries.  Nothing should be done by this House, this Government or any Member to put that facility at risk.  The pre-clearance facilities, I have no doubt, underpin many hundreds, or thousands of jobs in this State and in America.  Rejecting this facility, as some in this House have called for, would only serve to make travel between Ireland and the US more difficult and would be a premature reaction; it is simply a reaction from some.<\/p>  <p>  Our job is to try to convince the United States and the new US Administration that we have a long-standing, friendly relationship with the US and to try to convince it, in diplomatic terms, of the error of their ways with this executive order.  It is only right and proper that the Minister raised the issue at his numerous meetings.  With General Michael Flynn departing the stage the Minister will have a new US Secretary of State to deal with shortly but it is important that we do speak loudly, in a respectful way, as friends to the United States.  When we do not agree with something we should say it.  I am glad the Minister has done so in Washington, DC at various high level meetings.  I ask the Taoiseach - directly through the Minister - that in his discussions with President Trump on St. Patrick's Day the matter is raised directly with him and not just with his officials.  It is important.  Our deep relationship with America is longstanding and unique.  Many people claim unique relations with countries and I believe that the Ireland-America relationship is unique and America will know that Ireland's views, and any criticisms that we have, are meant in the best possible way.<\/p>  <p>  While the travel ban has been suspended and overturned in courts in the United States, we should also mention to the US Administration that as it is party to the Geneva Convention we believe that the ban, refusing entry and sending people back, contravenes Article 33 of the Geneva Convention that says: \"No Contracting State shall expel or return ... a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\"  That is very clear and it is why I do not believe that the executive order stacks up in US law or international law.<\/p>  <p>  There was much debate, as the Minister has alluded to, as to whether or not the Taoiseach should still travel to the White House on St. Patrick's Day and I want it on the record of the House that Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes the Taoiseach should travel to the White House on St. Patrick's Day.  This visit is more than a photo opportunity, as some people feel.  It is an opportunity to meet and engage with the new US President and his Administration and it is of major strategic importance to Ireland.  Maintaining professional relationships with the governments of other countries is central to Ireland's industrial, cultural, economic and diplomatic policies.  The upcoming visit to Washington, DC should be used as an opportunity to press President Trump on the plight of the undocumented Irish people in the US.  The visit can be used to explain in clear terms the mutual advantage to both our countries of the presence of US companies operating in Ireland, employing thousands of people here and - as the Minister has outlined - of Irish companies operating in the United States that employ thousands of US citizens in America.  This is the type of partnership relationship that I would like to see us evolve further.  It is not us, as a junior partner in a relationship, asking the United States.  I believe that Ireland, with Irish companies in the US, is the 11th biggest investor in the United States and we are also a significant market for the US.  Ireland is a significant springboard for the US into the European Union.  That partnership approach into the future is the way we should be dealing with and working with the new US Administration.  When people are partners and adult it means that we can criticise each other and say when it is that we are not happy or when we believe an administration is going down the wrong road, as it is now with this executive order.  Can one imagine the reaction in America, and what an insult it would be, if this Government and the Taoiseach actually followed the line that some Members of this House wanted, by refusing the invitation and by not travelling to Washington on St. Patrick's Day?  Maybe people want it to be an insult to President Trump, and I personally would not agree with many of his policies-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Which policies would the Deputy support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I would say to Deputy Ryan that it would be very easy, and childish, if Ireland were to say that its Head of State is not going to visit Washington on St. Patrick's Day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>He is Head of Government, not Head of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>This arrangement has been in place for decades and I ask Deputy Ryan what message it would send to the American people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That we stand up for certain principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00800","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>What message would it send to the American people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C00900","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>That Ireland is a decent country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C01000","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is all very well to say that we would send a clear message to President Trump, but what message would it actually send to the American people, to the near 40 million people in America who claim Irish descent and Irish heritage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C01100","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487151900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>They would be proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500005#C01200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487152500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What message would it send and what effect would it have on the 50,000 undocumented Irish in America and their plight if this Government and future governments took that position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500006#D00100","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487152500,"counter":22,"content":"<p>They are hostages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500006#D00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487152500,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin knows this from his time in Cabinet.  There is no way on earth he would have suggested to the Taoiseach 12 months ago that the Taoiseach should not to travel to Washington D.C. on St. Patrick's Day.  To say anything otherwise is ridiculous and is pushing the bounds of reality.  Deputy Howlin would not have done it and neither would Deputy Eamon Ryan had he been sitting at the Cabinet table.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reality that we have to deal with.  This has a long-standing effect.  I do not like the executive order.  I condemn the executive order and I have outlined why my party has condemned it.  However, we have to live in the real world as well.  There are ways of putting across our disgust and displeasure with that order.  Such an approach amounts to engaging rather than stepping back and saying we are not going to visit the White House or interact with the new US Administration.<\/p>  <p>  How easy would Deputies feel?  My question is for those Members who advocate that our Government should not be represented.  The Taoiseach represents the people.  It is not only a question for the Taoiseach, because he represents the D&aacute;il and the people.  Let us suppose the Taoiseach refused that invitation.  How easy would it be for us to get other meetings?  How easy would it be for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to be able to go there and advocate for the undocumented Irish?  How easy would it be for any of us to pay a visit to the US Congress, the House or Senate, to explain why our country would go down that route and effectively insult another nation by refusing an invitation on St. Patrick's Day, our national day?  It would affect not only that particular event but all the other events that occur around it.  Deputies know that is the case.  It was an easy soundbite on the day when many people, including me, were singularly angry about the executive order.  Many people in America are angry too and this will be dealt with in America.  It was an easy soundbite for parties to say the Taoiseach should not travel or that he should not go to the United States.  It was not based on any fact or in any reality.  That ship has sailed.  The D&aacute;il must move on.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we speak in one voice on the fundamental part of this issue, that is to say, as democratically elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann we condemn the executive order on the basis that I have outlined.  It is discriminatory and racist and contravenes the Geneva Convention as well.  I hope this ban is overturned.  I hope the US Administration has a serious rethink about the road it is going down and the new policies it is undertaking.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to turn briefly to the issue of the undocumented Irish.  Like many here, perhaps including Deputies Howlin, Eamon Ryan and Crowe, I have had occasion to raise the issue of the undocumented Irish when in America.  It seems we are continually raising it and we are not getting any further down the road.  Rather than dealing with immigration reform, groups have come in and are lobbying for overall immigration reform in the United States.  It seems further away than ever.  How far down the road are we in respect of discussing a bilateral arrangement?  It has been discussed at a high level over several years.  I am in favour of a deal along the lines of the deal between the Australian and US Administrations.  Reciprocal visas are issued to people from both countries with up to 10,000 on each side.  Irish undocumented could apply for these.  We are going to have to be inventive and think in a new way.<\/p>  <p>  It is pretty clear that under this US Administration there will be no major immigration reform.  The plight of our undocumented is even more precarious.  Indeed, we have seen the actions of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies in America already.  They have clamped down already on those they believe to be illegal immigrants.  We really need to redouble our efforts.<\/p>  <p>  I am unsure whether the Minister will have an opportunity to respond later.  If not, perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McHugh, can.  I call on the Minister to bring the House up to date.  This has to be a priority for us.<\/p>  <p>  A fair point was raised with me when I was in America.  We are dealing with 50,000 plus Irish in America who are undocumented.  However, we have undocumented people in Ireland as well.  We have to remember that.  All parties and the Government should look at dealing with that matter and regularising the undocumented people who have been here for eight, nine or ten years.  Their children have been born in Ireland but they still have no status.  I believe that would strengthen our case when we are advocating for Irish citizens abroad.  We could demonstrate that the Irish State has taken a positive step in respect of regularising undocumented people who live here and who deserve to stay.  We should consider these elements.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the executive order is most unhelpful.  My party condemns it completely.  I call on the Taoiseach to raise the views of the elected Members directly with President Trump and his Administration on 17 March and at every opportunity thereafter.  It is unfortunate, as I said, that we do not have a motion that can be passed from the House.  That is not the fault of anyone sitting here.  It is telling that no one from AAA-PBP is here to contribute to the debate.  They shouted loudest in the days after the executive order.  They were beating their chests and pulling their hair out and berating everyone else.  Deputy Coppinger was at it that day.  Despite this, they are not even here to contribute.  That is rather telling about their policies and political approach to the issue.  I thank the Minister for outlining the Government position.

For many watching the earlier events and the election it was a case of bluster and bad hair.  Some passed him off as a harmless charlatan.  As the election campaign developed and people saw what was behind the individual and what he was saying, many became frightened.  Like many other groups, Sinn F&eacute;in is completely opposed to these comments and the racist, sexist and sectarian policies that he articulated at various times during campaign.  Collectively, we need to oppose them in Ireland, the USA and anywhere else where they feature throughout the world.<\/p>  <p>  The uncomfortable reality for many of us is that Donald Trump won a democratic election and he is now the US President.  While we respect this democratic victory, collectively, we must all oppose his extreme, unacceptable and dangerous policies.  We know that there have been widespread protests in the USA to protest against the policies of the Trump Administration.  These popular protests were some of the largest seen in the history of the USA.  The international outcry at the actions of the Trump Administration was palpable as well.<\/p>  <p>  Donald Trump's executive order brings an uncomfortable shiver and it has halted the US refugee programme.  It also introduced a collective travel ban for citizens from seven Muslim countries.  It was plainly wrong on every level.  It involved a blanket 90-day travel ban for nationals coming from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  It labelled millions of innocent people as somehow suspect, not right, criminal or potentially a terror suspect.  It was to be discriminatory and selective on a truly vast and unimaginable scale.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the ban has been suspended by the courts but, as we know, that ruling continues to be challenged.  Even people with the magic green card were to be refused entry at America's airports, something that was previously unimaginable.  Anti-immigrant and anti-immigration policies that were perverse, fear driven and not based on reality or any known facts were somehow to be the order of the day under the new US Administration.<\/p><p>We know that generations of Irish people who fled starvation, poverty, oppression and conflict to make a new life contributed in every way to building the country that calls itself the United States of America where millions of them and their descendants still live.  It is their descendants, proud Irish-Americans, as well as many other immigrant groups, who are among the most outraged at President Donald Trump&rsquo;s so-called executive orders which are, in fact, exclusion laws.  A major concern for many Irish people is not only these anti-immigrant, racist and sectarian policies but also that they might somehow be implemented or enforced in Ireland through the pre-clearance system operating in Dublin and Shannon Airports.  My party shared these legitimate apprehensions and stated our belief the Irish Government needed to make it explicitly clear that it would not in any way legitimise or implement the executive order at pre-clearance centres at Dublin and Shannon Airports.  I was particularly concerned that Ireland's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and other international agreements could be, by default, undermined and that the order would violate people&rsquo;s rights.  I am led to believe a meeting between US and Irish officials on pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon Airports has been brought forward from 1 March to 23 February at the insistence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I also understand the Minister has ordered his Department to review the pre-clearance set-up.  While I welcome this initiative, I am looking forward to scrutinising the findings of that important review when it is completed.<\/p> <p> What has also heightened our concerns is that Irish visitors to the United States will now need to declare whether they have travelled to the named seven, predominantly Muslim, countries in the previous six years when applying on the ESTA, electronic system for travel authorisation.  Again, this is wrong.  It is welcome that the US courts have stopped this ban in its tracks.  Just last week a federal appeals court, under extreme pressure from its advocates, unanimously upheld the temporary suspension of the order.  It seems likely, however, that the Trump Administration will appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court or try to rewrite or modify its flawed executive order.  Many of us would prefer, if anyone listened to us in the Trump Administration, if it conceded defeat and recognised that its discriminatory policies were not legal or supported by the majority of the American people.<\/p> <p> Again, there is growing concern that the Trump Administration is trying to somehow sidestep the democratic legal checks and balances in place primarily to keep a check on the power of the President's office.  Cracks are already being exposed, with key spokespeople in his Administration receiving warnings about promoting the commercial products of the Trumps.  Additionally, the US President&rsquo;s new national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has had to resign after it was revealed he had misled the US Vice President, Mike Pence, and other top White House officials on his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.  The huge protests we have seen on the streets of the United States and in its airports suggest the cracks are widening and that this will be no easy task for the Trump Administration.  The message is that American citizens will not lie down.  I express my solidarity with all those protesting against anti-immigrant, racist or sexist policies.<\/p> <p> Last week President Trump also began to enact another pillar of his platform, namely, the deportation of undocumented or illegal immigrants.  Across seven states immigration officials launched a series of daytime raids, seizing people in their workplaces, in shopping centre car parks and from their homes.  The agents insisted that it was routine and that most of those arrested had criminal records.  However, migrant support organisations spoke about widespread and terrified communities that were convinced that their loved ones would be taken away.  There are also widespread media reports of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents going door to door in neighbourhoods with supposedly large amounts of immigrants, asking people to present their papers.  People are panicking and really scared.  Poor people from Latin America, particularly Mexico, are said to be the most worried.  It is the poor who are the target.<\/p> <p> The Irish Central news organisation has also reported that in Irish immigration centres in New York there has been a marked rise in the numbers seeking advice and to adjust their status or apply for citizenship since President Trump&rsquo;s inauguration.  There is currently over a month-long wait to see an immigration counsellor in the Queens immigration office.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has made clear that he will travel to the White House for the annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day event.  Surely in his visit he cannot ignore these developments and it cannot be business as usual.  The primary focus of his trip has to be on engaging with the Irish diaspora, standing with the undocumented Irish and maintaining our strong ties with Irish America, particularly as regards the ongoing challenges and the process of peaceful change on this island.  He needs to assert in the strongest possible terms the collective position of the people of total opposition to any racist, anti-women or anti-immigration policies of the Trump Administration.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s main engagement in the USA is with Irish America, the bridge between this island and people in the USA.  Many Irish-Americans are as appalled as anyone else by the policies articulated by President Trump.  We will engage with them and listen to their mounting concerns.  However, it is important that, as part of this debate, we do not focus only on the United States.  We also need to take an in-depth look at immigration policies in Ireland.  In September 2015 the Government agreed to resettle and relocate 4,000 refugees in Ireland in two years.  While we welcomed this commitment, we argued that it could have been more generous.  From all accounts, we will fail to reach this target by September 2017, despite the Government&rsquo;s claims.  The world&rsquo;s worst refugee crisis is evolving and our response is one of denial and prevarication.<\/p> <p> Like many others, I have been contacted by people who are desperate to get their family members to Ireland.  Some have experienced the absolute brutality of Daesh.  Despite being law-abiding Irish citizens, they are refused permission to bring their desperate and vulnerable family members here to safety.  There is, rightly, much talk about the undocumented Irish in the USA.  What about the undocumented in Ireland?  Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, estimates that there are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented migrants, including children and families, living and working in Ireland.  What are we doing to assist them?  Research carried out by MRCI revealed that one in five undocumented migrants had lived in Ireland for more than ten years, that 89% were employed and that one in three had been in the same job for more than five years.  I am, equally, appalled by how they are treated and their insecurity.  We ask US politicians to create a pathway for the undocumented Irish but nothing for those living in the shadows in Ireland.  Is that right?  Is it fair?  We should urgently implement a straightforward transparent scheme to give people the opportunity to come forward and apply to regularise their immigration status in Ireland.  We need to do this to be consistent.  We could then request, with some moral authority, that the same be done for the undocumented Irish in the United States.<\/p> <p> I also use the opportunity to refer to the Dakota Access pipeline project, against which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have led large, vibrant colourful protests.  The proposed 1,200 mile pipeline will link North Dakota with Illinois across their sacred lands and it is a proposal that will threaten their water supply and cultural heritage.  They have legitimate concerns about the real environmental risks the pipeline will create.  It will disturb their sacred areas and ancient burial sites.  There is a high risk that it will lead to the pollution of their drinking water source.  The project was approved without even the most basic of consultation with the tribe which have been bravely demonstrating against the building of the pipeline, joined by other Native Americans from across North America.  Anyone who has seen the videos of peaceful protesters being attacked by private security companies with dogs and pepper spray would have to be made of stone not to be moved.  That is the atmosphere in which the immigration policies are being implemented.<\/p><p>The Obama Administration had halted some work on the pipeline but representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe knew that the battle was far from won.  President Trump has now overturned that decision to halt the construction.  He has signed an executive order to advance the construction of the pipeline under terms and conditions to be negotiated.  The order expedites the environmental review that President Trump described as &quot;incredibly cumbersome, long, horribly permitting process&quot;.  I have sent my solidarity to those protesting about this pipeline project and legally challenging its construction.<br\/><br\/>I said at the outset that people in Ireland did not know of Donald Trump.  The &quot;trump&quot; people of my generation grew up knowing was the use of that word in the song, &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;.  Apparently, as the song goes:<\/p><blockquote>Nellie the Elephant packed her trunk,  <br \/><br \/>And said goodbye to the circus,<br \/><br \/>Off she went with a trumpety-trump,<br \/><br \/>Trump, trump, trump.<br \/><br \/>Nellie the Elephant packed her trunk,<br \/><br \/>And trundled back to the jungle,<br \/><br \/>Off she went with a trumpety-trump,<br \/><br \/>Trump, trump, trump.<\/blockquote><p>Donald Trump might go back to the Wall Street jungle and go trump, trump, trump.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500006#D00600","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487153700,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Deputy has a hidden talent as a storyteller as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500008#F00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1487153700,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will not try to engage in poetry in my contribution.  I want to begin by saying there was a deep sense of shock across the House when the executive orders were signed by President Trump.  It would have been better had there been a common voice rather than individual statements on that.  Obviously, we do not have a consensus view on every issue but on the issue of this executive order and its impact on a group of seven countries and their citizens, we have a common voice.  It would have been preferable had it been possible to craft a motion that we could all formally adopt and submit to the US authorities but we have statements and we will have to deal with it on that basis.<\/p><p>The election of Donald Trump caused dismay - that is not too strong a word - or certainly deep concern among many people in Europe and certainly for anybody involved in public affairs in Europe.  Some welcomed it but from listening to the Irish people the vast majority of them shared those real concerns.  Having watched since his inauguration, with growing and deepening concern, his hateful rhetoric being transposed into executive action, all of us have to reflect on all these matters in a new way.  It is not business as usual.  Most of us got involved in politics because, on a basic level, we wanted to do our bit to make our own communities and country a better place.  We come at it from different perspectives.  We all came into public life to improve the lives of our people.  In doing so, we try to set high standards for ourselves and to hold ourselves to them, to imagine a better society and to persuade people that those imaginings can take concrete form.  There is not a politician who has not failed in that endeavour in some way.  We are human, we make mistakes, we err, but time and again we try to do better and sometimes we succeed, and that renews people's faith in democracy.  What is unique and different in my view about President Donald Trump is that he never once sought to be the best possible version of himself.  During the course of the year and a half that he was campaigning he sought at every opportunity to stoke up fear and insecurity in the American people and to ruthlessly target the most vulnerable, and this from the United States that gave the world the idea of a Bill of Rights and proudly presents itself as &quot;the land of the free and the home of the brave&quot;. <\/p><p>As a democrat, I must and do accept the democratic decision of the American people.  They voted for a man whom they believe will change things and they voted in a way that says they are unhappy with the <i>status quo<\/i>in America.  Across the western world, all of us involved in politics have to reflect on that message.  As we learn more and more of the contacts between Donald Trump and President Putin of Russia, who was one of the first to congratulate President-elect Trump and made no secret of the fact that he wished President Trump to succeed in the election, and as we see people like Nigel Farage and Marine Le Pen queuing up for photo opportunities with the new president, I believe we have real cause for concern.  We commemorated a century of our proud history last year but today we have to wonder how much of our history we in the western world have managed to forget.  Far right forces, building on support from disaffected and vulnerable working class communities, are once more growing and targeting bile at vulnerable minorities.  How quickly we forget.  Those of us who reject such an approach to politics must turn to the task of restoring faith in the democratic process among people who feel they have been alienated and forgotten.  <\/p><p>I have spoken previously about the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit of the Taoiseach to Washington.  Ireland has long-held deep relations with the United States of America, some of which the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, referenced in his contribution.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien said, we have very deep business interests, with Irish companies employing Americans in almost as great a number as American companies employing Irish people here.  We depend on each other for investment.  We have deep tourist links.  Across most of the island of Ireland American tourists are an important part of our economic well-being.  We have deep cultural links with not only a common language but the same taste in music, history and so on, and up to now we shared values.  This is the nub of it.  I believe that the values we share are shared with the American people but they are not Donald Trump's values.  For decades we have been able to enjoy significant access to  senior US politicians in or around St. Patrick's Day.  This has allowed us to raise issues that matter to this country on all the topics I mentioned, issues that matter to the Irish people.  That access, as Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Brien have said, is extremely valuable.  I know from talking to others that other countries are very jealous of it, but it is not the only thing of value.<\/p><p>Ireland is an open and tolerant nation.  We believe that those who are experiencing violence and oppression in their home nations should be welcomed to nations that can provide them with safety, security and a future.  President Trump does not share those values.  Indeed, he is openly hostile to them.  He and his team have made clear that they are unwilling to hear any discordant voices.  In fact, they are unwilling to even listen.  I believe and I have said it publicly, and I did not say it to have a soundbite and I resent it being characterised in that way because this is a major issue, that it is not business as usual.  Our Taoiseach should not present himself in the Oval Office or in the West Wing of the White House to be humiliated, and that is what it would be in the same way as, I believe, Theresa May was, with President Trump holding her hand as a formal endorsement of his policies.<\/p><p>I strongly support the visit in recent weeks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, to the United States.  I said this publicly.  The Minister engaged with senior Administration officials and senior elected politicians while doing Ireland's business.  That engagement, arguing for what is important to us, is really important and significant but it is different from the shamrockery and glad-handing that surround St. Patrick's Day.  I was privileged to spend ten years as a member of Cabinet, during which time I travelled on St. Patrick's Day missions all over the world.  It is true that I did not always travel to the most savoury of places but the United States is quite different.  We can give a different message to the United States.<\/p> <p> It was suggested this morning in this Chamber by Deputy Darragh O'Brien that I would take a different view in government.  Those who suggest the Labour Party would take different stand seem to have forgotten that when it was in government, the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, refused to attend the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York while LGBT organisations were banned from it.  Former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, refused to attend the St. Patrick's Day dinner in Savannah, Georgia, because women were banned from that event.  Those events obviously do not have the same standing as the formal shamrock event in the White House but the values that informed the decisions on those events have informed our analysis of this matter also.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien should note that Fianna F&aacute;il was very critical of both Deputy Joan Burton and Mr. Eamon Gilmore for those decisions.<\/p> <p> Sometimes the right choice is to travel to a country and openly criticise the actions taken by a government that fly in the face of our values.  That is a legitimate presentation that was made this morning.  It was done when Deputy Jan O'Sullivan travelled to Malawi for St. Patrick's Day, for example.  She used that opportunity to be outspoken in her criticism of the homophobic policies that were being pursued in the country at that time.  That had an impact because some change followed in 2012.<\/p> <p> I have sympathy for and an understanding of the Taoiseach's difficulty in grappling with this question.  These are tough calls.  Ultimately, however, the decision must be based on which action best represents the values of the Irish people, whom the Taoiseach is supposed to represent on these trips.  It is not simply a political trip but a representative trip on behalf of the Irish people.  Therefore, I have an understanding of and sympathy for the Taoiseach in making the choice but I do not believe he is making the right choice.<\/p> <p> As I stated, I do not think anybody believes that when the Taoiseach travels to the White House and openly makes comments that clearly set out Ireland's position on the policies being implemented by Mr. Donald Trump, anybody will listen.  Why does anybody in this House imagine that the Taoiseach will fare better than the Australian Prime Minister a short few weeks ago, on whom the telephone was simply hung up, or the Mexican President?<\/p> <p> The recent US executive order is dangerous, wrong and racist.  It will increase radicalism and not diminish it in anyway.  We must reject those policies and the values that underpin them.  I believe that is what Irish people want.  It has been said that the issue of the undocumented Irish is so important because they might be affected by any refusal to go through with the normal St. Patrick's Day event.  One can celebrate St. Patrick's Day in the United States without doing that formal work.  It is an extraordinary presentation of the facts, however, if one regards the undocumented Irish as some sorts of hostages whose plight requires us to kowtow to an Administration for fear their circumstances would somehow be worsened if we did not pay proper obeisance to President Trump.  That is a poor analysis of the circumstances and one that does not do justice to the very strongly held views of the Irish people.<\/p> <p> These are very difficult times.  The Trump Administration is new and unprecedented.  Every day when we get up, today no less than any other, a new part of our reality is to check the latest announcement, pronouncement or executive action of the Trump Administration.  These are days, issues and phenomena that require us to break the notion of business as normal, or the view that because we have always done something, we must always do it.  I believe strongly that the values that are important to us and under assault not only in the United States but also elsewhere, including across Europe, deserve to be defended by us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500008#F00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487154300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On Saturday, 11 March, United Against Racism, along with a host of other organisations, including trade unions, Palestinian solidarity groups, anti-war groups, women's rights groups, abortion rights groups, LGBT groups, environmental groups and pretty much anybody who has a progressive bone in their body, will be marching here in Dublin appealing to the Taoiseach not to go to Washington.

One can go through the list.  President Trump has put whole nations in his firing line.  People understand the mortal threat he represents and they are mobilising across the world on an unprecedented scale.  The protests we are seeing in the United States are of a scale that has not been seen since the late 1960s.  People understand that this guy represents an absolutely mortal threat, namely, the threat of pulling the entire political spectrum in the direction of the fascist and Nazi politics of the 1930s.  I do not say that lightly.  Let us be clear: I do not believe Mr. Trump is a Nazi but he is dangerously echoing the politics of the Nazis, and he has people who are openly sympathetic to fascist politics in his Cabinet.  He has given a fillip of support to actual Nazis and fascists across the world, who were jumping with joy when he was elected because his policies have legitimised theirs.  They are all cock-a-hoop over what he is doing, what he represents and the boost he has given to them, breathing life back into the politics that led to the Holocaust.  We should not underestimate the threat this man represents.  This is not just another nasty president or just another particularly right-wing and obnoxious leader; he is an existential threat to the whole world and has to be recognised as such.<\/p><p>That is why it is imperative that we mobilise against him.<\/p> <p> He has pulled off an extraordinary trick by harnessing the legitimate anger of many working, poor, disillusioned and disaffected people in the US at the betrayals and failures of the Obama Administration and the Democrats and pretending to be an anti-establishment figure as if he is going to give the establishment a kicking in a way that will serve the interests of the American working people, when he is actually manipulating that and turning it in the most dangerous right-wing direction.  It is important for us to say this because those of us who are opposed to Trump should in no way use our opposition to whitewash Obama's crimes and betrayals of promises such as, for example, keeping Guantanamo Bay going, 260,000 bombing raids in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in the world and millions of refugees turned away from the US borders.  If we do not recognise the hypocrisy, failures and betrayals of Obama, we will not be able to engage with the angry people in the US who look to Trump as an alternative.<\/p> <p> Trump is not an alternative.  He is the extreme right-wing face of the establishment.  I say this to anyone who has illusions to the contrary.  His cabinet is the wealthiest in the history of the world.  It is not a cabinet representing the little people.  It is a cabinet of the 1%.  Wilbur Ross is worth $2.5 billion, Betsy DeVos is worth $1.25 billion, Rex Tillerson, formerly of ExxonMobil, is worth $325 million, Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, is worth $300 million and Andy Puzder, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a CEO in the fast food industry who is hostile to the minimum wage, is the Secretary of Labor.  I do not have time to go through the lot of them.  His entire cabinet's personal wealth, not including Trump's own, is $4.5 billion.  There is more wealth in his cabinet than in 63 of the poorest countries in the world.  That is incredible.  Trump is a representative of the 1% who is using the anger felt by people in America - the poor, the unemployed and the disaffected - and turning it in a vicious, racist direction against Muslims, ethnic minorities, gay people, women and anything that is progressive.  He must be resisted.<\/p> <p> I will mention one other group in that regard.  Today, Trump is meeting Benjamin Netanyahu.  Since Trump's election, Netanyahu, who has smashed through any sort of serious attempt at trying to make peace with the Palestinians, feels that he is completely off the leash and, citing Trump specifically as the reason, can expand illegal settlements into Palestinian territory.  If Trump moves the US Embassy to Jerusalem, it will be like throwing a grenade into the political process in the Middle East.<\/p> <p> Against the threat that Trump represents, for us not to go on St. Patrick's Day would be the sort of protest that would be felt.  If the Government goes, it will be legitimising and endorsing him as some sort of normal US President with whom we can have normal political discussions.  We cannot.

The question of airports remains relevant.  Some of the impetus has been taken from the debate by the brilliant protests, which gave the three judges who blocked Trump's order the courage to take a stand against him.  We will wait to see what happens, but the threat has by no means gone away.  If the Taoiseach, Fine Gael or the Government is trying to pretend that it is okay to go to the White House on St. Patrick's Day, that will not be accepted.<\/p>  <p>  There is a saying, \"By your friends shall you be known\".  Let us look at Trump's friends and appointments.  Carl Paladino, one of the key people who ran his campaign, wished death upon the Obamas and called Michelle Obama a \"gorilla\".  These are the people with whom the Taoiseach will be shaking hands.  General Flynn, who has been reluctantly sacked by Trump, said that Sharia law was taking over the US.  He is anti-Semitic and racist and says that the fear of Muslims is rational and that Islam is like a cancer.  He has been sacked because of his own stupidity regarding other issues, but these are the people the Taoiseach is going to be meeting.

That is great.  Steve Bannon from the so-called alt-right, who is trying to rebrand racism and make it more palatable, is homophobic and believes in a hierarchy of races, genders and religions.  He is the most anti-woman person one could ever meet.  He believes that every telegraph pole in the south should be festooned with a Confederate flag.  These are the people Donald Trump appointed.  He also endorsed candidates who wanted to expel Muslims completely from America, so the idea that he will not pursue the Muslim ban is erroneous.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to remind Deputies that there are Irish Muslims as well.  Some people are probably not aware of it, but we have a large Irish Muslim community.  I met a group of Muslims on Friday night.  There is a large concentration of Muslims in the Dublin Mid-West and Dublin West constituencies.  Many of them are dual citizens.  I was asked about this issue.  Although we are hearing that it is okay to travel with an Irish passport, the reality is that, if a person has brown skin, is a Muslim and arrives at an airport, he or she will fall prey to being treated badly.  Reassurance on this matter has been given for now, but the US will want to extend its measure.  We should take on board the fact that there are approximately 60,000 Muslims in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government often argues that it will make a statement, but the best way to make a statement is by depriving Trump of a PR job on 17 March and of the chance to gain kudos among the Irish community in the US.  That is the strongest statement.  The Taoiseach was humiliated in the D&aacute;il yesterday when he changed his story several times.  I would not trust his ability to handle Donald Trump and escape unscathed.<\/p>  <p>  What are Americans who oppose Trump doing?  When Betsy DeVos visits a school now, students walk out and parents picket.  That is how they protest.

His actions are so erratic, vulgar and tactless that the public is finally paying attention to things that have been going on for years, but under the watch of more polished and less transparent politicians.  As a result of legal challenges in the US against Trump's so-called travel ban we are discussing something that happened for two weeks and then stopped and now just the threat remains, but for Americans living abroad who happen to hold the wrong citizenship or those living in America with the wrong citizenship this threat is very real and has already led to the separation of families.  Trump is a problem for neoliberal politics and neoliberal politicians.  He is a neoliberal and much of the same religion as Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il except he does what he says he will do, which is obviously scary.  He has bypassed the pretence that the American political system is anything other than a brothel for the corporate class and their lobbyists.  He has directly appointed to top Cabinet positions former CEOs of corporations that used to have to pay to have their views represented and interests defended in Congress and the Senate.  Many of the people who are in his Cabinet at the moment are the very same people who were pulling the strings in Obama's government and Bush's government before that.

The lack of honesty in politics is not rare and it is not confined to Trump.  We have helped the American military to bomb Afghanistan for 15 years through facilitating them at Shannon Airport.  We are horrified that Trump is introducing a ban on Muslims going to America - it is terrible - but what does it say about us that when Obama was bombing the living daylights out of the same people we had so little to say about it?  We were even prepared to let them use our airport to do so.  Where was the outrage then?  It is madness.<\/p>  <p>  Do people realise that Obama deported more undocumented migrants in his term of office than all the American Presidents from the 20th century put together?  He has created a record for deportation.  Last year alone he dropped 26,000 bombs and that was one of his more peaceful years.  He talked peace but he was a warmonger.  The question of whether the Taoiseach should go to America and talk to Trump is a moot one.  I challenged the Taoiseach in the House two years ago before St. Patrick's Day.  I suggested that if he was going to America to meet Obama that he should please raise his drone campaign, which was causing huge problems for the world.  It was increasing the prevailing level of terrorism.  I do not believe the Taoiseach raised the issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a case of whether the Taoiseach goes to the White House or not, if we are going to analyse who he is going to talk to then in fairness he would not talk to many.  On that basis, I do not think he should talk to Hollande.  As to whether I would send a trade mission to Saudi Arabia, I would not.  When we go on a trade mission to Saudi Arabia we do not mention the word \"Yemen\", although genocide is being carried out there.  I find it interesting that the mainstream media have turned on Trump.  He has not killed a fraction of the people Obama has killed yet.  I do not say he will not do so, and I will not defend him.  He is an ugly racist.  I have no problem challenging what he does.  However, let us not pretend that things were different before now.  Why was Trump able to do what he did?  One of the reasons he is able to tap into the groundswell of anti-Muslim fear and bigotry is because that has been cultivated for years.  How did he come up with the seven countries?  In December 2015 Obama signed a Bill making it more difficult for those people to get into America.  He did not ban them completely but he initiated a Bill which made life more difficult for them.  In February 2016 the Obama Administration added Libya, Somalia and Yemen to the list of countries one could not have visited but allowed dual citizens of those countries who had not travelled there access to the visa waiver programme.  Dual citizens of Syria, Sudan, Iraq and Iran are still ineligible.  Obama restricted visa waivers for those seven Muslim majority countries and now Trump is seeking to stop them completely.  Could we not admit that what the Americans have been doing for years, and in particular since 2001, after 9\/11, has done untold damage to the world?<\/p><p>It is reckoned they have killed over 2 million civilians in the Middle East region and beyond with their military efforts.  We still allow Shannon Airport to be used.  If the Taoiseach was prepared to go to the US and stop the Americans using Shannon Airport as a military base and raise the subject with President Trump, I could live with him going.

Yet this D&aacute;il cannot agree a motion that the Taoiseach can take with him to speak on our behalf and on behalf of the people of Ireland.  The motion on the extreme left with some support from others that the Taoiseach should not go increases the hypocrisy that has been apparent in this Chamber for the past while, including the discussion yesterday involving who said what to whom and so many other topics, including the health waiting lists where we have a post-fact situation and alternative facts.

This makes me more afraid.<\/p>  <p>  During the election, the Democrats failed to go to Wisconsin and a number of other states.  They arrogantly refused to listen to what the people were telling them and to hear the message that people voted for someone who they clearly knew was volatile and who lives for his ego and to feed his ego.  They put this man in power such was their lack of belief in the alternative.  Similarly in Ireland, if we go back to last night's discussion, we discuss everything but the issue.  The Ceann Comhairle has asked us to stick to the topic and I am sticking to it and I believe Deputy Wallace stuck to it because there are implications for the way we deal with language and issues.  Last night, we went around in circles and utterly failed to deal with the issue of alternative facts and alternative statements relating to a crisis that goes to the very heart of our democracy.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, with the simple motion asking the Taoiseach not to visit the US, we ignore the fact we have let every Taoiseach up to now go to the US without any problem.  As Deputy Wallace has pointed out, many Presidents prior to this one have done dreadful things.  A total of 60,000 troops passed through Shannon Airport, which is a civilian airport, not a military one, in 2016 alone.  Over 2.5 million troops and rising have used Shannon Airport since 2002.  On a daily basis, we have troops and military aircraft going through Shannon Airport.  We have a post-truth situation in respect of the facts of this matter.  Courageous people in a small group attend Shannon Airport on a regular basis and keep a close watch at great cost to their personal lives to try to provide the evidence that each Government has asked them to provide.  We are back to what is done to whistleblowers.  We talk about President Trump's hypocrisy and post-truth statements.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to learn anything in the D&aacute;il today, it is to learn what the messages from what is happening in the US are for our democracy, which is very fragile.  What should we learn from that?  One of things to learn is that speaking out in Ireland is a very dangerous thing to do and that regardless of who the person in question is, be it someone in politics, an ordinary person going to Shannon Airport or somebody in the health services, the Army or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has the courage to speak out, we will get them one way or another.  If we do not see parallels between that type of society and the type that President Trump is openly cultivating, we are in serious trouble.<\/p>  <p>  I have no difficulty with the Taoiseach going to the US.  It is a long tradition.  However, he should go with a very strong message from this D&aacute;il that we abhor President Trump's policies and will not stand by them.  He should meet all the groups over there who have gone out on a limb, again at great cost to themselves, and the progressive members of the Democratic Party.  He should stand with them and use the opportunity to say that there is a different way and that Ireland represents a different way.  Of course, we will have difficulty with that because, as the Minister of State knows, over many years in this Chamber, our neutrality has been interpreted in the most elastic way possible.  Neutrality means that we can allow a submarine from the Netherlands to dock at Horgan's Quay in Cork and an armed sailor to step out on the quay because he is from a friendly country.  This came from a response to a parliamentary question.  We can allow the troops I have mentioned go through Shannon Airport and still call ourselves a neutral country.  We want to deplore President Trump but, equally, we want to maintain the facilities at Shannon Airport without question.  <\/p>  <p>  I began by saying that it is a privilege to speak.  We have a responsibility to highlight issues, discuss them rationally and come forward with our vision.  There is a different way of doing things that is more sustainable for all of us in the long term.  It is not sustainable to have military aircraft flying through Shannon Airport.  It is not sustainable on health and safety grounds and on economic grounds because it is costing us a fortune.  It is not sustainable if we are going to persist in saying that we are a neutral country.  I shudder at what President Trump represents but I shudder even more at what is behind him.  It has been stated that President Trump lost faith in General Michael Flynn not because he was lying but because it became public.  That is exactly the same theme that dominates public life in this Chamber.  It is only when facts become public that we discuss them but we do not have a horror of what happened before those facts became public at great cost to the personal lives of the whistleblowers and those courageous people who come forward.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500012#K00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1487156100,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this very important subject and would like to put an interesting story on the record of the D&aacute;il.  On 25 December 1988 - the morning of Christmas Day - my mother gave me the gift of a book.  I opened the book and asked her who it was by.  She told me to read it and that we would talk about it that evening.  The book was <i>The Art of the Deal<\/i>by Donald J. Trump.  We had a discussion on the book that night and she said &quot;you're young&quot;.  This man was 40 at the time.  She told me to watch him because he would be an interesting man and could finish up running the world.  She did not say &quot;ruling the world&quot;.  She said &quot;running the world&quot;.  She never mentioned politics but she had a bit of foresight in that she was able to see that he was a man of potential who was going places.<\/p><p>We must accept and respect the democratic right of any person to put themselves forward for election.  That has happened and he is the US President.  One can like or dislike him but we, as Irish politicians, have a job to do.<\/p><p>There are many Irish people, such as my own family, aunts and uncles, who were glad to go to America in the 1950s and 1960s and get gainful work.  We appreciate the fact that they were able to work and live in America, as were all of our friends and cousins.  Mr. Trump is their President now.  Whether we like it or not, that is the situation.<\/p> <p> I become very upset when I see sectors and religions being picked out and victimised.  For instance, I am very personal good friends with many Muslims who came to my county.  They are most welcome.  Their religion and faith is their own business in my opinion.  Everybody's religion, whatever it is, should be respected and nobody should be condemned or castigated for what their belief is.  Obviously, every group of people will have bad people amongst them.  That is the way of the world.  What I see in Mr. Trump's policies is that he seems to be attacking certain groups that he should not be picking out in that way.  It can be seen as populist.  We have to be mature enough to work on it with him at the same time.<\/p> <p> I heard people standing up in this House, as is their right to do, to say that the Taoiseach should not go to America for St. Patrick's Day.  That is nonsense.  Our Taoiseach and taoisigh in the past have always had the tradition of going over and being welcomed in the White House and making the connections.  I myself had the opportunity on two occasions as mayor of our county in Kerry to go over and represent Kerry County Council.  I met a lot of people.  For instance, I remember meeting the late Mr. Ted Kennedy and him taking me into his office.  I remember him carrying a number plate from Kerry with \"Ted Kennedy - KY - 1\" written on it.  He put it up inside in his office.  These sorts of things have to be done.  That is the art of politics.  One need not like or love somebody.  One can actually dislike somebody.  At the same time, politically, one has to get on with it.  It would be completely disloyal to the Irish-Americans that live across all states.  We would be doing them a sever injustice if we were to snub the tradition of our Taoiseach going to America on St. Patrick's week.<\/p> <p> While I hear other people criticising politicians for travelling around the world during St. Patrick's week and saying that it is a waste of money, I have to be honest and say the complete opposite.  I have experience of it myself on a small scale from being mayor of our county and being sent out to meet all of the different people in meetings set up by the local authority.  I believe that is an investment.  It is like spreading fertiliser.  Grass does not grow unless fertiliser is spread to make it grow.  It is the same thing with politicians travelling the world making connections, meeting people and meeting business people.  That is a job of work.  I hear people being critical about a Ceann Comhairle, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle or Ministers going on foreign travel, but I see it as the spreading of the fertiliser to make the grass grow.  They are sent out to be respectable and to meet other politicians and business people.  It is a very important job of work.<\/p> <p> Last week, I was in Brussels.  I am a very bad person for travelling because I do not like it.  However, I went because it was important to go as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I was very glad that I was accompanied by great Senators and Deputies who worked very diligently over a two-day period.  We had something like 14 meetings in two days.  We met an awful lot of people.  We discussed solutions to the Brexit issue.  We did not give our time to discussing the problems; we looked at solutions.  I am glad that we are having this debate about President Trump's policies, because it involves the same thing.  His policies are throwing up difficulties and problems for us and for people all over the world.  However, it is our job to get on with it and to try to use our considerable influence in America.<\/p> <p> Presidents of America have always had an eye on the ball of the Irish vote and the Irish-Americans.  Presidents want their support and want to be popular with Irish governments because of the simple fact that Ireland has a respectable name all over the world.  Our workers who left Ireland, whether in the 1950s, 1980s or 1990s, were great people.  They went to Australia, England and America.  They broke their backs working.  They were dependable, reliable and determined to get on in life, which is what they did.  That is why we have to keep up our links.  We have to keep going to America and keep sending Ministers there.  We have to try to keep up a good and healthy relationship and not condemn for the sake of condemning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500012#K00300","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487156700,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I too am pleased to be able to speak on this debate.  On the business committee, I was one of the people who opposed the frenzy we had to have an immediate debate and have huge hand-wringing, eye-washing and God knows what.  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, Mr. Trump was elected by the American people.  We are always told that it has one of the greatest democracies in the world.  Now they are blaming the state system.  That was never blamed before.  That is the system they have always had.  It is a relatively new democracy and they have always accepted the outcome.  Just because they do not like the result, they want to blame the system.  I wish Mr. Trump well.  I certainly have concerns about some of the things he has done as well.  However, he was elected.  No matter what he is or is not, we have no business here telling him what to do.  Is he going to listen to us?  I doubt it.<\/p>  <p>  As regards all of the hypocrisy about this executive order, the seven countries on the list were actually compiled by the Obama administration.  Where was the outrage then?  They were ready and waiting.  The Obama Administration stopped processing Iraqi refugees for six months in 2011 and banned Cuban refugees.  There was not a word about it.  Let us cut out the hypocrisy.  President Trump is doing it for 90 days, as against six months, with a visa-by-visa exception written into the executive order.  I believe that is more humane, understanding and fair.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an arbitrary list although Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said it was.  It is anything but.  It is a ridiculous statement that completely ignores the reality of where extremist Islamic terrorists are being radicalised.  Iran is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.  Saudi Arabia is especially close with the United States.  Where was the outrage then?  Let us get it into perspective.  We have enough issues to deal with here in our country.  Indeed, we are not going to be crowned in glory by the shameful treatment we have given to the unfortunate individuals seeking asylum in Ireland.  I have met many of them in Carrick-on-Suir and around Tipperary that are held in those terrible holding centres for up to a decade in parts of the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, knows about that too in Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  Former president Mr. Bill Clinton talked about halting the immigration and refugee process to enable reform and protection of American citizens.  Where was the outrage then?  That was Bill Clinton, who did a lot for the peace process here in Ireland.  He did a lot for Ireland in my opinion, but where was the outrage then?  It is just because certain sections in the media and certain people in politics do not like President Trump or the result of the election.  We had independent observers over there, or so we were told.  I happened to be on a radio show one night with one of those observers, a Deputy from the Government side of the House.  His name eludes me now.  He was lamenting the outcome of the election.  I thought he was an independent observer.  I did not realise he was over there canvassing to stop Trump.  However, this is the farce that goes on.  Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned travel.  It is very important.  However, if one travels as an independent observer, one is meant to be an independent observer to observe the election and what goes on.<\/p>  <p>  There is plenty of fake news and bias in the media here as well.  Yesterday evening the Taoiseach was telling us stories for three hours and, in spite of the plug in his ear getting messages telling him to change his tune, he was rambling around the House like it was a rambling house, ag cuardach.  He was talking to someone, then ag caint le someone else, then maybe a song and a bit of dance and then he would come back to some other thing he thought of.  He had meetings before he had them at all.  He ran away with himself.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p>  <p>  The Obama regime came in as the be all and end all.  My own daughter was at his inauguration.<\/p><p>There was a 200% increase in the number of drone strikes and hundreds of thousands of children were slaughtered under the Obama Administration and what was the reaction from here?  Silence.  President Obama deported up to 3 million illegal immigrants, more than any other President.  This was the great saviour, but what did he do?  He added $7 trillion to the US national debt, yet he is the messiah of the American economy.  The hypocrisy is staggering.<\/p> <p> We now want to deal with President Trump.  With regard to the Taoiseach travelling to the US for St. Patrick's Day, every Taoiseach has done that.  It is a wonderful privilege to get the opportunity to go to the White House.  I was there on one occasion as cathaoirleach of a county council and I saw the importance of that day with all the side meetings taking place and so on.  I urge the Taoiseach to meet as many of the undocumented Irish as possible.  The Taoiseach must go to the White House.  He might be able to stay there a long time because we might not want him back but, nonetheless, as Taoiseach of the country he has to go, and I wish him well in that.  I know he will do his best, once he puts away his phone.  I hope he will not text the way he did in front of the Pope, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p> <p> The persecution of Christians throughout the world is unbelievable.  I have tried to debate that issue in this Chamber.  His Holiness, the Pope, asked me and other people from Ireland and throughout the world who are members of the International Federation of Christians to return to our Parliaments and debate the genocide of Christians.  Who bombed the hell out of Iraq, Syria and other countries in the Middle East?  Christians could operate with impunity under terrible dictators but now they are being slaughtered because they are Christians.  Like Deputy Healy-Rae, I welcome people of all faiths and none to Ireland, but where was the outrage when that genocide was taking place?  It is important that we put that in perspective.  They bombed the hell out of those countries and Christians, as well as members of minority Muslim sects, were slaughtered.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien will bring forward a motion on the Yazidi tribe but we cannot be selective.  All people who are being persecuted must be protected.  I do not like some of President Trump's language but we should not condemn him about his business.  It is a pity we do not have a few businessmen on the opposite side of the House because we would have a better country.  We would not have a Health Service Executive, a Tusla and all the rackets that are going on, with people promoting themselves and not being accountable to anybody.  We need business decisions and people with a business brain.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae told a lovely story about his late mother and the leabhar sin fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;.  She was a very intelligent and far-seeing woman.  She read the book and she could see what would happen in the future.  It is a pity that she went to her eternal reward before it happened but I am sure she knows, and I am glad her son was able to recount that story.<\/p> <p> As far as keeping the preclearance centre at Shannon is concerned, we have to keep it.  It is vitally important for the economy and also for our own people.  The people involved are dealt with humanely.  President Trump is talking about dealing with immigrants on a case basis, not imposing a blanket ban or deporting 3 million immigrants, as was done by his predecessor.  We must have some perspective on this issue and be sane about it.  We should not run away with ourselves thinking that we can interfere with a democracy like the United States.  We cannot keep our own little house in order.  There is an old saying that if one cannot clean one's own windows and keep the good flag up one should not be looking at anyone else's windows or flag.  We are living in the valley of the squinting windows if we think we can affect what is happening in a country far away.  The US has always been good to us.  I have many relations in the US.  There are many undocumented Irish living in the US and until he starts interfering with them, I will not be expressing any outrage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500013#L00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487157300,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Murphy sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500014#M00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487157300,"counter":93,"content":"<p>We are sharing time.  I want to put on the record that I hate everything about Trump and his Administration but he was not imposed.  He was elected, and whether we like it or not, that will be the scenario unless something intervenes in the coming four years.<\/p><p>It is obvious that the Taoiseach will travel to Washington for St. Patrick's Day but it is regrettable that he will do so without a motion that could be commonly agreed by this D&aacute;il.  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and I, along with others, having regard to the requirements some of the civil society groups wanted included, put forward a motion on which we believed there might be common ground.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>This Parliament strongly and categorically condemns President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order which adopts a targeted ban on refugees and migrants from certain countries.  This Executive Order amounts to discrimination on the grounds of both nationality and religion - itself a gross violation of freely accepted international human rights obligations.  We affirm that this Parliament stands in solidarity with US civil society organisations and all those in the US working to uphold the legal rights of all those affected by this discriminatory Executive Order.<\/blockquote><p>Unfortunately, while it almost got there the motion did not receive common agreement.  It would have been far better to have that kind of statement passed by this D&aacute;il than to trust the judgment of the Taoiseach to represent this country's viewpoint.  President Trump is an extremely strong personality; none of us need to be told that.  I believe the Taoiseach is not a match for him.  I would not have confidence in a sufficiently strong message being delivered.  It was a missed opportunity not to have passed that motion.<\/p><p>An irony, which is important to point out, is that the coalition that was put together, the so-called war on terror, primarily involved the United States and the United Kingdom, yet those two countries are on the fault line now with regard to immigration.  Those are the countries that largely destabilised the very region from which they are now refusing to accept migrants, and some from the most extreme circumstances.  Is there a viable risk?  Has that risk been analysed?  David Bier from the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity is involved in analysing immigration policy.  With regard to the risks he stated:<\/p><blockquote>The order would ban all people entering the US from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen, and yet no terrorist from these places has carried out a lethal attack in the United States.  Indeed, no Libyans or Syrians have ever been convicted for planning such an attack.  Moreover, the likelihood of being killed by any refugee from any country is just 1 in 3.64 billion a year.  This discrimination is arbitrary and cannot be rationally justified based on an assessment of the risk.<\/blockquote><p>He went on to point out the US policy during the years of the Second World War and Roosevelt's Administration refusing to admit Jewish people fleeing the Holocaust.  The risk suits a political agenda and evaluating whether that risk is real needs hard facts, not fake news.  The idea of our Taoiseach having a nice photo opportunity with a bowl of shamrock, with perhaps a patronising pat on the back, will not be acceptable to most people in Ireland.  The Taoiseach must make it very clear in advance of travelling to the US exactly what he intends to say and how he will represent us on this visit.  That is critically important.  A refusal to travel this year would be a refusal to travel next year and the following two years, and we would then begin to wonder whether there was a loss of influence.  We may be a small island on the periphery of Europe but we are a country not without significant influence in the United States, largely because of the large Irish diaspora in the United States.<\/p><p>There is an opportunity to say something significant.  The war on terror started under the Bush Administration.  It continued under the Obama Administration.  It is legitimate to question our role in providing Shannon as an assistance in what has happened over those two Administrations.  We are not without questions to ask ourselves.  Before the Taoiseach's visit happens, if he is still the Taoiseach, we need to know what will be said.  We need to revisit the prospect of getting all-party agreement on a motion rather than the Taoiseach going without an <i>imprimatur <\/i>from the Parliament-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500014#M00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487157900,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500015#N00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487157900,"counter":96,"content":"<p>-----which is very possible to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500015#N00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1487157900,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The United States and Ireland are woven together in so many different ways.  We have an incredibly complex and far-reaching history.  The first tune people learn on the fiddle when they are taught music here is the hornpipe &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;.  I was amazed to find out recently that weeks after &quot;Rights of Man&quot; had been published in New York it was published on Grafton Street and it took hold in this country like fire.  In response to it, Mary Wollstonecraft, who lived across the road at No. 15 Merrion Square for a period, added to the fire with &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;.  This freedom thinking, from the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, were embedded deeply the Irish culture.<\/p><p>Washington's army was made up hugely of Scots Irish immigrants who were refugees from religious persecution.  These were the founding fathers, and the founding institutions were set up by that culture.  When Washington's army was fighting the British there was a reduction in soldiers here because the British had to fight in America.  In response the Irish Yeomanry volunteers were established, as were the United Irishmen by Wolfe Tone.  Each of them used the shamrock in their flags to denote this new sense of Irish nationhood, freedom and identity, and they sang about &quot;The Wearing of the Green&quot;.  This is still sung, and it is deeply woven into US consciousness and thinking today because of all those people.<\/p><p>In our house we recently found out that an ancestor of my wife's as a young 14 year old from the dissenting tradition in Donegal read <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin<\/i>by Harriet Beecher Stowe and with other young men from Donegal migrated to join Lincoln's army.  It is an incredible story, a 14 year old going on the boat and journey to join Lincoln's army.  With Lincoln's army they fought under the flag with the shamrock.  At the same time, as Sebastian Barry writes in his book <i>Days Without End<\/i>, the confederates came at them with the confederate flag on one side and the shamrock on the other.  The image on the flag is not unimportant.  It also flew in Mexico, when St. Patrick's Battalion took the Mexican side in the Mexican-American War.  This imagery, particularly of the shamrock and the wearing of the green, goes right back to the core of Irish and US history.  This is why everyone was so proud when John F. Kennedy came here and presented the flag which is at the entrance of Leinster House.  It is an important part of the House.  It is the flag of the Irish Brigade showing its involvement in the American Civil War.<\/p><p>We must remember today what Kennedy said, that self-determination can no longer mean isolation and no nation large or small can be indifferent to the fate of others.  It is in this context the Green Party states we should stand up and wear the green today and state we respect and stand up for the Mexican Government.  How dare the Trump Administration treat another government in the way it has treated the Mexican Government in recent months.  If it treats that country of 120 million people, its most important nearest neighbour, in this way how will it treat others?<\/p><p>We stand up for the wearing of the green and state we do not accept torture.  We stand by Thomas Paine.  We stand by Washington and others, and the values established under the US Constitution because it is plain wrong not to do so.  Yes, Deputy Mick Wallace is right, we also stand up against the drone strikes the Obama Administration introduced, but at least there was a sense in the Obama Administration that it believed in those constitutional values which are woven into our constitutional values which we hold so dear.  We stand up and wear green by stating we refuse to accept a US Administration which is about to try to dismantle the climate agreement in which we all have a life or death interest for the future of our people.  For this reason we must stand up.  Perhaps most importantly, we stand up for the rights of those people from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East who have been the victims of the terrorism that has been unleashed by the bombings in Iraq and Libya in recent years and state we cannot stand for this.<\/p><p>What do we do?  We should take inspiration from the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, who stated it is not an automatic right but an earned honour for someone such as President Trump to speak in Westminster Hall, and he will not accept him doing so because opposition to racism and sexism, support for equality before the law and an independent Judiciary are hugely important considerations for the House of Commons.  They are the constitutional values we should also stand up for but we are not doing so.<\/p><p>I am afraid the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was very weak.  Commenting on the order, he stated it could have far reaching implications and further noted the Government fully shares the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding the development.  That is not good enough.  It is not strong enough.  It does not give a message that we need to stand up and represent.<\/p><p>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said in response to the Minister that his approach was very well handled and well considered.  I am sorry but I beg to differ.  Even if we had been in government, and as the Deputy said it is not easy in government, we would not just be sitting back and doing nothing, which is what is represented in the Minister's speech.  What can we do?  The Taoiseach is going over there.  Let us start by not presenting the bowl of shamrock.  Let us think of other ways of making a point because this is all about images and symbolism.  Let us get an Erin go Brach flag from the period.  It does not have to be Mexican one because I do not believe we have any of them left.  Let us get a symbol of the shamrock which represents what we stand for.  Why not hand him a copy of the <i>Rights of Man<\/i>with a small shamrock on top?  We must do something differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500015#N00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487157900,"counter":98,"content":"<p>He cannot do that if he does not go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500015#N00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487157900,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Okay, he will go.

I wish to address the House on the matter of the executive order signed by Presided Donald J. Trump on 27 January 2017.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora I have had an opportunity to meet a great many organisations and individuals working with Irish immigrants in the United States.<\/p><p>Last September, I visited San Francisco and had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Immigration Center, which supports Irish immigrants in the Bay area.  I met great people, such as a fellow townie of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Fr. Brendan McBride.  Such people are heroes in our eyes who have worked continuously and tirelessly for people who need support in these areas.<\/p> <p> I subsequently travelled to New York, where I chaired a round-table meeting with representatives of the coalition of Irish immigration centres, which brings together Irish immigration centres from across the US.  This was an important opportunity to reassure them of the Government's support for those working with Irish immigrants in the US, as well as its commitment to the twin objectives of relief for the undocumented and greater pathways for migration to the US.  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Billy Lawless, who has been working very closely with me.  He attended the meetings in New York and in January was at the meeting in Washington with the ambassador, Ms Anne Anderson, and her colleagues in the different consulates.<\/p> <p> In addition, I travelled to Boston and western Massachusetts last November where I again met with representatives of Irish immigration and pastoral centres, including the Irish Cultural Center of New England, the Irish Pastoral Center and the Irish International Immigration Center, as well as Irish citizens living in the US.  These briefed me on the plight and uncertainty of some Irish citizens living in the United States.  I wish to make clear the Government's current and future actions in helping Irish citizens abroad through the emigrant support programme, which allocated upwards of &euro;2.3 million, or 70% of the funding.  These ongoing efforts to secure the best for our citizens abroad are just one area where we benefit greatly from Ireland's close historic and cultural relationship with the United States, a relationship we must do our best to maintain and grow.  We talk about the unique relationship a lot and we have to be conscious of the great people involved such as Colleen Ward, who organises an annual festival in Milwaukee on which 3,000 volunteers work and which is attended by some 500,000, and M&aacute;ire Colcannon in Canton, Massachusetts who works to protect the Irish language and as a custodian of all things Irish.<\/p> <p> Ireland's relationship with the United States predates the independence of either nation.  Our bonds are based on a shared history and culture and underpinned by common values including democracy, the rule of law and respect for all, regardless of ethnicity, religion or origin.  Engagement with the new Administration is not confined to the events surrounding St. Patrick's Day but is continually reinforced by state visits throughout the year.  Our diplomats in Washington and across the United States strive ceaselessly to sensitise local and federal leaders to Ireland's concerns and objectives.  Likewise, our embassy and consulates provide consular services to Irish citizens in distress on a daily basis.<\/p> <p> As has been noted, it is only by continuing to engage with policy makers in the US that we can articulate our concerns, whether it be with regard to the recent executive order or concerning the need for immigration reform, to bring relief for undocumented individuals in the US.  The Government will continue to use all opportunities which arise to set out its case, in the interests of our citizens.  I have taken a personal interest in the undocumented and have met many people who pay their taxes but have had to use Skype for funerals and have missed significant family events back home such as weddings.  I met a couple from my own county who are both undocumented.  They had to drive their children to an airport last summer but were unable to join them and there are many hardship stories such as this.  I acknowledge all the people working in the consulates and Irish immigration centres for the great work they do on behalf or Irish citizens abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500015#N00800","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487158500,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I agree with a lot that has been said on two issues.  The first is the incoherence of certain members of the Opposition in respect of the special links between Ireland and the United States, which we all accept.  The second is the statements by some members of the Opposition to the effect that the Taoiseach should not go to the US.  In other words, they are suggesting that we sever the important links between Ireland and the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Another worrying element is the suggestion by some members of the Opposition that pre-clearance facilities and Shannon and Dublin be discontinued.  Pre-clearance at Shannon and Dublin is of massive importance, not only to the development of the Irish economy but in the fostering of relations between Ireland and the United States of America.  We are the only country in the European Union and the only country outside the Americas with access to pre-clearance, with the exception of one country in the Middle East.  To suggest that we relent in this would be detrimental to the relationship between Ireland and the United States and hugely detrimental to the development of the economy.  In my own area over 200,000 people come through Shannon's pre-clearance annually and it is of critical importance.  We should send a very clear statement of commitment to Ireland's relationship with the United States of the America.  The Taoiseach has said he will enunciate the Government's position on President Trump's announcement on immigration policy but it is of critical national importance that this House gives a clear statement on our ongoing commitment to pre-clearance for Shannon and Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I support the statements of my Government colleagues and wish the Taoiseach well in his forthcoming visit to the White House.

I profoundly disagree with the policies of President Trump and I think most people in this country probably do.  That does not mean we should not visit a country which has received millions of Irish emigrants over generations and centuries.  When Irish people went there first, they were of the wrong religion, they spoke the wrong language, were very poor and had serious issues with America as it was then.  However, they stood the test of time and integrated into society, as Muslims do now and will in the future.  The ban is wrong and if there is to be a recognition of that strong view in Ireland the Taoiseach should also visit the Statue of Liberty and lay a wreath for the words that are there written, welcoming \"your poor, your huddled masses\".  That is what America is about and that is what this country is about, in terms of meeting the needs of our emigrants who have gone there.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the appointment of the ambassador to Ireland, Brian Burns, and it is important we continue to build strong bonds, which a new ambassador, American investment and a recognition of the importance America places on its Irish heritage will do.

I firmly believe this executive action, which in my opinion could be considered as sectarian, went against the very fabric of what makes the United States such a great nation of the world.  After all, the USA's history is that of an immigrant country where people from all walks of life could arrive and have a chance at making it and live the American dream.  This presidential executive order did not fit in with this mixed race culture, nor did it fit in with the overall values of the United States in general.  It was unAmerican and I was glad to see that it was successfully challenged by the US judicial system and has since been removed, for now.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think any politician could argue about the right for an independent country to take actions to protect its borders, but I do think there is a problem when a person who, during his election campaign, was openly intolerant of other religions and races seeks to ban certain religions or races from entering his country when elected.  Alarm bells have to start ringing when this occurs as we have seen similar sentiment expressed by the likes of Nigel Farage, during the Brexit referendum, and currently in France with Marine Le Pen.  The fact that the repercussions of this executive order actually took place on Irish soil brought this issue firmly into focus for many here.  It was no longer just something that could have been viewed on our televisions.  It was actually happening at our Irish airports.  For me, it became a reality because, despite this victory in the courts, my biggest concern right now is for the 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens currently living in cities throughout the USA.  Will they be next?  In the past number of weeks since the inauguration of President Trump, my constituency office has been receiving phone calls from families who are now worried about whether their loved ones will be targeted next.  There is real fear out there in the Irish US community.  If the President could target one classification of people without having any real reason to or without having any factual arguments, what is to stop him from conducting an attack on others?<\/p><p> Following on from the crisis, the question has been, and still is being, asked as to whether our Taoiseach should go to the White House.  People are saying that we should turn our backs on the White House and refuse the annual St. Patrick's Day visit there.  However, we would do the undocumented Irish a disservice if we took that approach.  We need to be in that room arguing on their behalf and fighting their cause with the President.  The relationship between the United States and Ireland over 200 years is bigger than any individual and it must be maintained.  I believe that our relationship with the United States of America will remain strong, but this executive order and its goals need to be condemned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500016#O00400","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487159100,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I am sharing time equally with Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin and Deputy Timmy Dooley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500017#P00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1487159100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Fianna F&aacute;il has already tabled a motion condemning the executive order which will have huge implications for Iran, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen.  The order also indefinitely halts refugees coming from Syria.  I do not believe for one moment that President Trump is concerned about our motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today.  While acknowledging that immigration policy is the domestic responsibility of any given country, Ireland has a moral obligation to stand up and say what is wrong.  Any type of discrimination based exclusively on race, religion or nationality is morally wrong.  That is why I have no hesitation in saying so.<\/p>  <p>  However, we have a direct impact and control over our own policy.  I find it bemusing that the Government can castigate other governments for their failings without looking at our own.  Our failings concerning the international refugee crisis are stark.  We are not measuring up to our international obligations in terms of resettlement and relocation.  To date, only four unaccompanied minors have been relocated in our country.  That is wrong.  <\/p>  <p>  Recently I attended a Council of Europe forum and had an opportunity of listening to the first-hand experience of a refugee who had been resettled and rehoused in Germany.  The brutality they went through in their mother country, brought home to me just how much Ireland is failing.  The Government needs to take that on board.  <\/p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of pre-clearance at our airports.  Two weeks ago, in somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction to the executive order, the Taoiseach acknowledged that he would carry out a review on pre-clearance at our airports.  We need to acknowledge and recognise that the pre-clearance facility is operated by US officials, not Irish ones.  Any rejection of pre-clearance at Shannon or Dublin would be a huge inconvenience not to America or President Trump, but to Irish citizens - the 1 million who use pre-clearance at Dublin Airport and the 200,000 who use it at Shannon Airport.  It would eliminate our competitive advantage, which many other European airports are intensively lobbying the US administration to achieve.  The Government should come out forcefully and say that there is no issue with pre-clearance at our airports.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is right to go to the White House on 17 March.  It may be his last foreign trip.  When he goes there, however, he should forcibly highlight the plight of the undocumented Irish in America.  The anxiety and fear of families with relatives living in America have certainly intensified since President Trump assumed office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500017#P00400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1487159100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Across Ireland and the world we have all watched political events unfolding in the US with increasing disquiet.  This is particularly so with President Trump's executive order on immigration and the ensuing battle with the judiciary.  This is despite the fact that citizens of the seven nations named in the order have killed no Americans in terror attacks on American soil.<\/p>  <p>  The Syrian people, in particular, have been subjected to the worst kinds of violence and injustice over the last few years.  As always, civilians have suffered the most with an estimated death toll of 470,000 according to the Syrian Centre for Political Research.  An estimated 11.5% of the population have been killed or injured while trying to escape.  The appalling humanitarian situation there makes the decision to ban all Syrian refugees from the US incomprehensible.  This targeted travel ban is in breach of the US constitution and the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.  This builds on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which recognises the rights of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries.  Therefore this executive order is a violation of international law and an affront to human dignity.  <\/p>  <p>  What about the estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish people living and working in the United States?  These are people who may have overstayed visas, but who have jobs, families and a way of life there.  They were depending on an executive order from the former President, Barack Obama, deferring the deportation of illegal immigrants with jobs and family ties there.  As this has stalled in the US supreme court, they are now afraid to leave the US in case they are refused re-entry.  <\/p>  <p>  Before Donald Trump's victory the Taoiseach described his populist policies as racist and dangerous.  However, the Taoiseach has been a lot more circumspect since President Trump was elected.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that the Taoiseach needs to visit the White House on St. Patrick's Day.  Thankfully, President Trump is not going to be there forever, but our national and international day of celebrating what it means to be Irish across the world will always be there.<\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the Taoisech must represent the feelings of the Irish people about these immigration policies.  Our much talked of close relationship with America can only flourish with honesty and clarity on both sides.  However, our own immigration policy is not one to be proud of.  Under the EU's resettlement and relocation programme we committed to taking 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers.  As of October 2016, some 487 programme refugees have been resettled in Ireland.  That is appalling.  We need to examine our own policies when we are lambasting those of another nation.  We are witnessing the largest global humanitarian crisis the world has seen since the end of the Second World War, and our response will be our legacy.<\/p>  <p>  To quote Confucius, \"Wisdom, compassion and courage are the three universally recognised moral qualities of man\".  None of these qualities is demonstrated in a ban on this most vulnerable group of people.  I want to offer my solidarity to all of those affected by the executive order.  I hope the US judiciary will succeed in preventing its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  My final quote is from Nelson Mandela who said, \"Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronisingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future\".  We have more in common than what separates us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500017#P00500","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1487159100,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  The discussion is clearly about the US executive order on immigration that President Trump has signed into law.  The order is, in itself, outrageous and racist in motivation.<\/p><p>The spirit of what the President has sought to do is to cast certain people into a position based on their race and religious belief.  It was clear to anyone who watched the former Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, say it was crafted in a way that met the requirements of what the President campaigned on but which was also legal.  It is clear what the intent was.  I am pleased that the checks and balances provided for in the US Constitution have scuppered the particular intent behind this order.  Notwithstanding that, there is an opportunity on the Taoiseach's forthcoming visit to Washington to set out very clearly what the Irish people see as the failure of the policy the President put in place and to recognise the true republican credentials that need to be addressed here, giving people rights based on who they are, not their religion, sexual orientation or place of origin.  Those are the principles the Taoiseach needs to espouse when he visits Washington in March.  It is important that we set out those principles and try to ensure that the US Executive recognises the undocumented status of so many Irish citizens and ensures they are not victimised based on the fact that they are undocumented, that they come from Ireland or that their religion is Catholic in the main.<\/p> <p> I want to respond to those in the House and elsewhere who suggest we should remove the pre-clearance facilities at Shannon and Dublin Airports.  I represent the constituency of Clare in which Shannon is based.  It is vital to recognise the impact of ending pre-clearance.  It would make the travel arrangements of the many people who travel for tourism and business more complicated.  It would increase the cost of fares based on the increased hassle for airlines and it would not matter a jot to President Trump or those seeking to put this immigration ban in place.  The only people who would be inconvenienced would be those travelling between Ireland and the United States of America.  I contend that it would be better to be refused entry in Shannon or Dublin than in New York, Boston or Atlanta.  For that reason, we must keep cool heads and use the diplomatic channels that exist to set out our principles and understanding of how two countries should interact in a diplomatic way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500017#P00600","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487159700,"counter":113,"content":"<p>In the three minutes I have, it would be difficult to fit in all of the outrageous and grotesque behaviours of Donald Trump, not only during his campaign but already in office as President.  His comments during the campaign and since have been racist, sectarian, sexist and homophobic.  It appears to many that there are no boundaries on what he might say.  Comments which only ten years ago would have been considered beyond the Pale for the most right-wing and craven elements in the Republican Party are now tolerated and considered merely controversial.  I have plenty of criticisms of previous presidents from Bush to Clinton and, indeed, Obama, many of which are related to domestic policy and may relate to imperialist interventions in foreign countries and unconscionable military actions.  However, there are those who would have it that President Donald Trump is being subjected to an unfair level of scrutiny and that progressives and the left are loath to criticise Democrats.  Deputy Mattie McGrath made a point along those lines.  It is not the case, however.  Indeed, much of the last term saw expectations of significant change dashed and, indeed, military interventions, drone strikes and a significant number of deportations which are a stain on President Obama's record.  Much of that policy was shameful.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that President Trump, much as I do not like it, is the legitimately elected US President.  That he won the election much be respected.  However, we must oppose collectively his extreme, unacceptable and dangerous polices and challenge them on an ongoing basis.  The important point about Trump is what he, his words and the executive order represent.  He is legitimising hatred.  It is now an acceptable policy for the US Government to treat persons from Muslim backgrounds as under suspicion of terrorism.  Through his words and actions, he has created a situation where it is acceptable to categorise an entire group of people as a threat to the US merely by reason of their religion or country of origin.  It is racism as an acceptable policy.  His words have given the far right and neo-Nazis around the world, whatever he is himself, succour and encouragement.  He has pushed the boundaries of acceptable debate to a level that is beyond comprehension and which accepts and tolerates racism, sectarianism, sexism and homophobia.  The actions of President Trump as regards the executive order are abhorrent to me and anyone with any sense of decency and fairness.  The order, which has become known as a Muslim ban, is arbitrary, vicious and racist.<\/p>  <p>  In my last few seconds, I note to the Taoiseach that I am aware he has said he will travel to America despite opposition in the House.  It is essential that when he is in the USA, it is not a celebration.  He must challenge President Trump in relation to the undocumented Irish and his policies.  Not only on St. Patrick's Day but on an ongoing basis, the Taoiseach must make it clear that the policies, words and actions of President Trump are not acceptable to the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500018#Q00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1487159700,"counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500018#Q00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1487159700,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Our overriding consideration is to vindicate the integrity of Maurice McCabe and to have a comprehensive statutory tribunal of inquiry into allegations that there was a concerted smear campaign against him.

I raise the serious situation of the State once again failing children with disabilities.  Today I will not speak about hospital waiting lists, Tusla, the children's hospital or any of the many other failures for those with disabilities, but about a child's constitutional right to education.  In Clonmel today, parents of at least 11 young children with autism do not have a school to send their child to in September.  This number is the minimum number and refers to a group of children that will leave an excellent autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in St. Mary's School in Irishtown in Clonmel that was set up by former principal, Mr. Gerry Ryan.  These children have nowhere to go and this number does not include the many other children who have been recently diagnosed with autism and are struggling in mainstream schools with insufficient supports.  They also require the support of an ASD unit.  Currently Clonmel, the largest inland town in the country, has no ASD unit at primary level, so these five year olds, who are legally obliged to attend school, have nowhere to go in September.  This is not just an issue for Clonmel.  It is an issue for children in Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town, Clogheen and Fethard.  For that matter, it is an issue for children throughout the country.  We are at a crisis point and the State and the Department of Education and Skills have no concrete plans to ensure that these children will have access to education come September.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I met, together with a group of concerned parents, two special educational needs officers, SENOs, from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  They admitted that we are at crisis point and that their hands are tied.  They cannot force schools to open a unit, yet currently no primary school in Clonmel is willing or able, for a variety of reasons, to open an ASD unit and people cannot get a school placement.  The reality is that it could be 30 km away if they can get one as many of the excellent units in surrounding areas are already full to capacity and have huge waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question tabled this week, the Minister for Education and Skills informed me that he had no plans to change the situation to require schools by legislation to open an ASD unit where a need is identified and that he hoped schools would open such units voluntarily.  Schools are doing their best, but they will not do that, so we will have to change the legislation.  I hate the word \"coerce\" but we have to try a carrot and a stick.  The situation in Clonmel and many other areas is that schools are not planning to open any units for a variety of reasons.  We hear so much from Government about changing the ethos of schools, as if it is the only issue surrounding children getting access to education, yet it continues to ignore the most serious issues, where children with special needs are being discriminated against because they cannot access education, as is their right.<\/p>  <p>  These children and parents do not have big organised lobby groups and the power of the media behind them.  They have to fight for everything and are sick and tired of fighting the State for the services to which they are entitled and so badly need.  These children are no different to those of the Taoiseach or to my children.  What will the Government do to ensure that these students will have a place to attend this September, as required by law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500020#S00800","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1487160900,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for his question.  He covered quite a number of schools in Tipperary.  It is clear that this is an important issue for parents and guardians of children with special needs.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, has made quite a number of changes in respect of the way in which we are examining this matter.  For instance, last year more than &euro;1.5 billion was spent on special needs education for children throughout the country, which is a significant proportion of the education budget for this year.  I say to Deputy McGrath and to the parents that the local SENO will assist parents in finding placements for their children.  Further, the number of ASD classes has increased from more than 500 to more than 1,000 to meet the growing demand since 2011.  The Minister of Education and Skills is very much aware of the issues and the Department will continue in its efforts.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 allows the National Council for Special Education to oblige a school to accept a student with special needs.

Many parents paid huge sums of money to get a private diagnosis because they were waiting in the system for years and schools miss the most vital areas.  We all know early intervention and diagnosis is vital.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and his Cabinet, particularly the Minister for Education and Skills, to meet these people.  We have tabled some amendments and I appeal to the Minister to accept them and not to vote them down.  This is a big problem not only in Clonmel and Tipperary but throughout the country.  Schools for some reason are not engaging.  They have many good reasons and I am not saying they should but we must make it more necessary and oblige them to take children with this diagnosis.

However, I cannot ask these questions because I must ask questions about the Maurice McCabe case, which goes to the heart of whether the Government can function and whether we have trust in it.  If something can be done to one, it means it can be done to all.  This goes to the heart of confidence in our democratic republic and constitutional system.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, rather than concentrating on who said what to whom, we need to concentrate on specific issues to ensure this does not happen again.

He stated the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is considering whether other whistleblowers should be included in the tribunal of inquiry.

We all agree with Maurice McCabe that we should not return to the O'Higgins version where an inquiry is carried out in private in an adversarial manner.  Can we make the tribunal of inquiry fully transparent by broadcasting proceedings on the web, on television or by other means?  If so, how will the protection of journalistic sources be protected given that, at the heart of this story, we will have to arrive at an understanding as to who contacted whom among the Garda, the journalistic profession and Members of the House?  Deputy McGuinness inferred last night that everyone knew, including the dogs on the street.  That is not the case.  We need to find out the truth in terms of who knew and who was telling whom.  The cornerstone of this case was a smear campaign and we need to work to find out who contacted whom to create that smear campaign. <\/p>  <p>  I do not know from where Deputy Mick Wallace got his sources but he read out a document in which he set out that such-and-such a garda texted someone else and another individual e-mailed someone else.  This is the level of forensic inquiry we will need.  If the tribunal of inquiry is to be transparent, as it should be, how will we agree terms of reference to provide for transparency and allow all our correspondence, mobile telephone and e-mail records to be made accessible?

We could then have a Government meeting on them tomorrow and have them discussed in the House, although it may not be possible to do this. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked my opinion in respect of extending the tribunal for other whistleblowers.  As the protected disclosures centrally involved the two senior police officers in the State, Mr. Justice O'Neill recommended a commission of investigation arising from these two protected disclosures.  While this will be a matter for the judge who conducts the tribunal of inquiry, it would be appropriate to provide a facility whereby the inquiry might be extended to other whistleblowers if the judge saw fit to do so.  Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring is restructuring the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to deal, in a much more trustworthy and I hope professional manner with complaints made by members of the Garda and others and protected disclosures or other information that may come that way.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that the question of protection of sources is central here.  At paragraph (g) of its draft terms of reference, the proposed commission of investigation was directed to \"investigate whether Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan, using briefing material prepared in Garda Headquarters, planned and orchestrated broadcasts on RTE on the 9th of May 2016, purporting to be a leaked account of the unpublished O&rsquo;Higgins Commission Report, in which Sgt McCabe was branded a liar and irresponsible.\"  This is an issue that will require some consideration by the judge in charge.  Also, it is a matter for whomever is appointed as a sole member as to how the inquiry should be conducted in public.  A tribunal of inquiry will have the support of the McCabe family if it is held in public and, therefore, will be fully transparent and accountable.  The matter of whether it is broadcast on the worldwide web or whatever would be for the judge to decide.<\/p>  <p>  I hope we can get agreement from everybody that it is absolutely necessary that the commission of inquiry be set up under the tribunals of inquiry Act.  Every day that passes denies the opportunity to have the central question answered as to whether there was an orchestrated smear campaign against Sergeant Maurice McCabe.

We also spoke briefly about the follow up to European Council meetings and how better to explain and communicate what we do.<\/p>  <p>  The exchanges at Valletta will feed into preparations for a meeting in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March.  The intention is to agree a paper there which will provide guidance for the EU in the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  We had an exchange on the European economy with ECB President Draghi at the December European Council, in which I participated but did not intervene.  President Draghi spoke about the improved economic situation across the Union, but underlined the need to continue reform efforts.  His view was that, while the statistics are better, many individuals have yet to feel the effects of recovery, and there is a need for them and for businesses to have confidence for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I had a bilateral meeting with the Maltese Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, in Valletta on Saturday, 4 February.  Malta currently holds the rotating Presidency of the EU and this was my second recent bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister.  Our discussions focused mainly on Brexit and the future direction of the European Union.  I explained in some detail our particular concerns arising from Brexit and we exchanged views on the negotiations ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2016, I have held bilateral meetings with the leaders of Spain, Poland and Cyprus, in addition to Malta and the UK.  I also held bilateral meetings in Dublin with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and with Michel Barnier of the Commission's Brexit task force.  My last bilateral meeting with President Hollande was in Dublin on 21 July 2016.  There are no specific plans for a trade mission to France in the immediate future.  At the informal summit in Malta, as at all meetings of the European Council, I met and engaged with my EU counterparts during the course of the summit and in the margins of the meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500025#X02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487163900,"counter":224,"content":"<p>We have nine questioners present.

My first question relates to the ECB President Draghi.  As the Taoiseach informed us, President Tusk invited Mario Draghi to deliver a brief intervention at the Council to get his views on economic recovery and the outlook for the European Union.  We understand his view is that while there was a pick up in 2016 he warned that 2017 was fraught with the risks posed by both Brexit and the outcome of the US presidential election.  Is the Taoiseach concerned at the recent remarks by the head of the US National Trade Council, Peter Navarro, specifically on Germany and his attack on Germany and the euro?  He said the euro was gaining unfair trade advantage from being grossly undervalued.  What is the Taoiseach's attitude to that statement and has he discussed it with any of his colleagues?  Will he discuss it with his American colleagues, in particular with President Trump, because it is very undermining of our currency for that sort of remark to be made by such a senior member of the Administration in the United States?<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the discussions in Malta, the Taoiseach has indicated that he did not circulate a position paper on Ireland's concerns on Brexit to the EU leaders summit in Malta in February.  Why was that?  What mechanism is the Government using to communicate our deep concerns about the impact of Brexit on this State to other European leaders?  Has a common position paper for Ireland been circulated to make sure that everybody understands the detail of our concerns?  What strategy has the Taoiseach employed to deal with the issue?<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the potential outcome of the debate, the decision on the terms negotiated will ultimately be determined by the Council, by qualified majority voting.  Ireland could be outvoted and we could be in a situation where we would have vehement opposition and yet have no blocking mechanism.  Has the Taoiseach raised that potential with his colleagues and has any thought been put in here to ensure that since no country is going to be affected in the way Ireland will be, that we will ensure that at least the deal negotiated is acceptable to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500025#X02575","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487164500,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Mr. Draghi did point out the trends for the future as he saw them.  Mr. Navarro raised the question about the status and strength of the euro with particular reference to Germany where the point was made about its exceptional trade balance and surplus.  I am sure this has been the discussion point at some of the Ecofin meetings of the finance Ministers.  From that perspective, the focus at the meeting following Mr. Draghi's intervention was to continue to do what Europe can do to improve output, productivity, growth and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The discussion of the 27 heads of state in Valletta concerned the future of Europe.  It was not so much based upon Brexit since Article 50 has not yet been moved but what the agenda for Europe is at the moment.  It is the Single Market, the digital single market, the capital markets union and how we deal with the question of migration.  I made the point previously that not a single Libyan was among the 181,000 migrants who crossed the central Mediterranean passage from Libya, so Libya is a country of transit for people coming from the Horn of Africa and north Africa in general.  These were all economic migrants who had paid for their passage to Europe and were being smuggled.  <\/p>  <p>  We have spoken to all the Heads of Government.

He knows that the British Government will trigger Article 50 in a few short weeks and that Prime Minister May's White Paper gives us some sense of the degree of impact her decision will have on all the people of this island.  I welcome Friday's civic dialogue plenary session.  The process has been very good, although I am disappointed by the cancellation of meetings in Northern Ireland.  In particular, the sectoral meetings have been very helpful.  Last week, the Taoiseach indicated in the context of the Assembly elections that he was concerned that holding sectoral meetings in Northern Ireland might leave the Government open to the accusation of interfering in the electoral process, but people in Northern Ireland read and listen to reports of what is happening in this State.  Nonetheless the election will be over so is it the Taoiseach's intention to hold sectoral meetings following the election?  I also want to ask the Taoiseach about a report in the media that the Government is looking at possible sites for customs posts along the Border.  Can the Taoiseach confirm or deny that?<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise briefly the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  Yesterday, his trial was delayed once again.  He has now been in prison for over three years.  Can the Taoiseach give us an update?  A total of 400 migrant deaths have been recorded in the Mediterranean since January 2017.  That is a huge amount of human beings.  Over 5,000 people died in the Mediterranean last year.  The Malta summit saw agreement on long-term co-operation measures with Libya and neighbouring countries but thousands of refugees are being held in Libya.  Has the Taoiseach raised concerns about this humanitarian crisis with our European partners?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500026#Y00400","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1487164500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>We made the point to them about the very frequent visits of our diplomatic service and a group led by the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to various locations to talk to ambassadors and the President of Egypt with whom I have had two or three conversations about Ibrahim Halawa.  Deputy Adams is well aware of the background to this.  Ibrahim Halawa is the only Irish national in prison and we want him to be released.  A statement was issued following his meeting with an all-party group.  I hope it can be brought to a conclusion fairly quickly.  Hopefully, the President will use his pardon.  I wish the court case would be held so that a decision could be made and Ibrahim Halawa could then be released home to his family and country.<\/p>  <p>  The sectoral meetings have been a big advantage and a big help.  Everything from transport to logistics to social welfare to pensions to hospitality was covered.  I have no objection to having sectoral meetings in Northern Ireland after 2 March.  The people of Northern Ireland will have made their choice then and I hope an Assembly and a working Executive can be put together.  It is important that people, irrespective of their political differences, would focus on the future.  Brexit will be a hell of a campaign in terms of negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin raised the point about qualified majority voting, which is an issue.  There are a number of small countries that are also affected, including the Netherlands and Denmark.  They are concerned that qualified majority voting could be an issue if the case is not made well.  This is why we are talking to all the leaders individually and that is why the Ministers are doing their business.  It is so that everybody is aware of the impact on a country like Ireland.  It has been pointed out by most of the economic reports that we will be the most adversely affected of any country.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope nobody is looking for sites along the Border.  I have seen reports drafted by customs officials but I have an agreement with the British Government that there will be no return to the Border of the past and that means customs posts along the Border.  This is a British policy.  It is not a technological issue.  This is a political challenge.  We do not want to see that happen because Deputy Adams knows the implications of that very well.

What bilateral meetings did he hold, how many meetings did he hold over the course of that day and which heads of Government did he meet with?  I am trying to get a sense of the progress the Taoiseach believes we are making within Europe on putting forward the unique position Ireland has post-Brexit, particularly in light of the fact that the British Government seems to have rejected out of hand the argument that Northern Ireland should be granted any special status.  My party leader and I met yesterday with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and very clearly told him that Fianna F&aacute;il is most disappointed and gravely concerned with that turn of events.  I am trying to get a picture as to how our EU colleagues are or are not supporting our position in advance of the negotiations.  They have not yet started but this is the positioning.  While we will be one of 27 member states, I want to make sure that we will not be left behind or part of the collateral damage that may occur post-Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il and I have stated that we remain firmly committed to the EU.  We understand that there are unique issues between the UK and us such as a unique trading relationship and a special relationship in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also mentioned the concerns regarding the unpicking of the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the human rights agenda.  The Minister mentioned that last week and then seemed to change tack and take the British line on it, which is that there is no consensus in Northern Ireland for a bill of rights.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we should be telling the British Government and our European partners that we will not accept any dilution of the Good Friday Agreement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500026#Y00600","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487164500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.

Obviously, at a European Council meeting of 27 or 28 member states, one meets most people but does not sit down for an informal or formal bilateral meeting with all of them.  That is the same as at any other place I meet and talk to EU leaders.<\/p> <p> I am now engaged in meeting each one of the leaders individually in order that they fully understand our problems in Ireland.  That is why I had a formal meeting on the Saturday morning with Prime Minister Muscat, who understands that this is a political challenge in respect of the Border and Northern Ireland.  He now understands now the common travel area.  Everybody in Europe appreciates that there is a peace process here.  I visited Spain to talk to Prime Minister Rajoy.  Spain also has an issue in Gibraltar, with which the Barnier task force must deal.  Gibraltar is an issue between Spain and Great Britain.  That is a bilateral between them.  Obviously, the Spanish would have great difficulty in asking for special status for Ireland because Catalonia is an issue for Spain.<\/p> <p> The point is that we have a particular set of circumstances.  We have a special designation in terms of the peace process.  There are special funds in respect of INTERREG and PEACE funds.  There is so much other support and we want to build on that for the future.  In my view, we already have special recognition and a special status that does not apply anywhere else.  How can we expand that in the negotiations ahead?  For instance, I met fishermen from all over the country last night.  It is a very complex situation.  We do not want fishing to be siloed or left on its own.  It has got to be part of the food chain along with the agrieconomy that is so important to us.  Yet, the difficulties with the Common Fisheries Policy are extraordinarily complex.  We do not want to be left in a situation in which a fishing fleet is removed from the exclusive waters of Britain, for instance, but has to put up with other people coming into the exclusive waters of Ireland.  We are glad to have the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.

I ask him to specifically comment on the deal that the European Union proposes to do with Libya for that country to take refugees.  We have gone from doing a deal with Turkey to doing a deal with Libya.  It gives the Libyan Government &euro;200 million to hold on to refugees and stop them trying to cross the Mediterranean.  I would like to know what the Taoiseach said in this discussion.  Some time ago, he spoke in very flowery language about the reality and the record of Irish people dealing with refugees.  The Taoiseach said: <\/p><blockquote>It is in our history and personality and in our DNA in Ireland, having dealt with coffin ships after the time of the Famine and the Great Hunger.  The humanitarian personality of Ireland is extraordinary.<\/blockquote><p>I do not see anything extraordinarily humanitarian about this deal.  In fact, both Amnesty International and M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res are very critical of this regressive deal with Libya, which will force refugees into absolutely horrific anti-humanitarian circumstances in which they are starved, beaten and raped whether they are men, women or children.  The record of the Libyan regime is absolutely appalling.<\/p><p>The Libyan regime is in tatters.  There is a civil war taking place there at the moment with three rival governments trying to control a very desperate country.  Our own record on taking refugees is not as the Taoiseach described.  We have been appallingly miserable to refugees in the middle of a humanitarian crisis.  We very recently returned &euro;4 million to the EU that was allocated to us to help resettle migrants.  We have 8,000 migrants - men, women and children - living in direct provision, which is a horrendously cruel system that needs to be challenged.  I want the Taoiseach to comment on this latest deal.  I do not know how to describe how EU leaders could even think of putting refugees into the hands of the Libyan state, given that it is in the middle of a civil war and given the reports coming back from our own Naval Service, which has helped to rescue people from the Mediterranean, of rape, brutality and total inhumanitarian treatment of those refugees in Libya itself.

The first issue is the discussion with Mr. Mario Draghi.  All recent data suggest that the European economy is showing some strength but faces very early threats.  There has been an uptake in growth and the deflationary pressure of the last two years seems to have been overcome.  That means that this year is going to be an incredibly important one, particularly when it comes to European Central Bank policy in response to these developments.  It is likely to end much of its market intervention activity, thereby pushing up the costs of public borrowing and weakening the balance sheets of major companies.  Taking these things together, I believe there is every reason that the Taoiseach should convey Ireland's concerns and position on these matters to Mr. Draghi.  While the ECB council is fully independent in setting policy, there are no rules to say the Taoiseach cannot actually convey our views to it.  Has the Taoiseach expressed an opinion to Mr. Draghi on European Central Bank policy or has he remained silent?  Has Ireland expressed its concern that no sudden actions be taken that might damage this still-fragile recovery across Europe?  Given the past policy of our banks, an increase in interest rates is likely to have a major impact on borrowers here.  Is the Taoiseach taking any actions in anticipation of rising interest rates?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the informal summit in Malta, the negotiations on Brexit will begin next week.  I believe the Taoiseach has held bilateral meetings with about one third of the other leaders of the European Council.

I am talking about formal bilaterals at which we can set out our concerns and priorities as a country.  That is important.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he needs to accelerate the levels of activity in conveying Ireland's key issues to the other EU Heads of State and Government, given the enormous impact of Brexit.<\/p><p> RTE reported last week that there is a widespread belief in Brussels that Ireland is complaining a lot in its analysis but is not coming up with concrete solutions or proposals.

I am concerned that the Italian Government has made it clear, both through the Prime Minister and its European Minister, that it proposes to reintroduce to the agenda of that meeting the notion of a two-speed Europe.  The Taoiseach visited the Polish Prime Minister recently.  He did not look very happy.  It might have been the cold but it was probably that the Visegrad countries, of which Poland is a member, are extremely upset at the idea, to quote one of the Italian European Ministers, that when Britain has quit the EU it will be an opportunity to go back to the federalist integrationist model which, as the Taoiseach knows, some states see as core member states but with which states from the eastern side of the European Union in particular do not agree.  In the context of Brexit, that means we will be caught like the proverbial meat in the sandwich.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Taoiseach previously on two issues about which I have also written and spoken publicly as well as in this House.  First, we badly need a Minister for Brexit because the delegation of functions with regard to that is not adequate in the context of all the issues the Taoiseach has on his plate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500028#AA00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1487165700,"counter":255,"content":"<p>We are out of time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500028#AA00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1487165700,"counter":256,"content":"<p>People are worried about that.

In my own Department, I have implemented significant restructuring by creating an amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a second Secretary General.  This restructuring brings responsibility within my Department for relevant  international issues together in a single integrated division.  This division supports the Cabinet Committee on Brexit and EU Affairs and manages the overall co-ordination of Brexit issues across Government.  There are 31 staff working in this division, including a small number of people seconded from outside the Department.  The resources of the division are kept under review.  While the staff in this division deal with a wide variety of issues, Brexit is an increasingly significant factor across the division.<\/p>  <p>  Work on Brexit is also supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and his Department, which now has a greater role in EU matters overall, with a newly created EU division and the existing division dealing with Anglo-Irish affairs both having important roles to play.  Across Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions are being strengthened to deal with Brexit.  More generally, each Department continues to have lead responsibility for Brexit issues relating to its departmental remit.  There is a broad range of overall co-ordination and consultation structures across Government, including the Cabinet committee and supporting senior officials group, and a wide range of working groups are in place.  Arrangements for handling Brexit are in place in each Department and resources have been allocated where needed.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit stakeholder group, which was set up pre-referendum as an information sharing forum, last met in October 2016.  Since then we have broadened our stakeholder consultation and engagement through the all-island Civic Dialogue process, which began with a plenary session on 2 November.  The second plenary session takes place this Friday, 17 February.  Between these two plenary meetings, 14 sectoral meetings examining specific policy areas in greater detail will also have taken place.  Members of those groups have been involved in these dialogues. This consultation process allows the Government to listen to, and to capture, the views of those most directly affected by the impact of Brexit from across the island in advance of formal negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Brexit  meets on a regular basis to deal with Brexit related issues.  The last meeting of the Cabinet committee took place on 26 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500028#AA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487165700,"counter":268,"content":"<p>It seems to me that one of the great difficulties is that each individual Minister is dragged left, right and centre in respect of their own portfolio and that there is a very strong case for a Minister who would be exclusively focused on the Brexit issue and putting together the various strands that are vital to a successful negotiation from Ireland's perspective in terms of Brexit and the engagement with various sectors.  For example, serious issues arise in the fishing and maritime sector given that, with regard to quite a number of species of fish, up to 60% to 70% of the catch is in British waters.  Post Brexit, that has obvious implications for many of our coastal communities if something is not done about it.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, I met with the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and it appears there has been no interaction with what is one of our world class industries which creates a huge amount of employment across rural Ireland in a sustainable way but which exports 80% of horses to the United Kingdom.  Up to two weeks ago there had been no interaction with such an important industry in terms of the impact of Brexit on that industry.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of activity taking place but some of the meetings are hastily convened.  Some people got only a week's notice of the one next Friday.  The content, substance and quality of the meeting is more important than just having the meeting and inviting everybody to it.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he needs to build up more confidence among people with regard to Brexit and also, in terms of the gravity of it, among the public.  I have said previously that I believe a huge opportunity was lost during the recent budget debate to convey that gravity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500028#AA01600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1487165700,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

They are the four main areas we have identified, namely, jobs and the economy, the Northern Ireland peace process, the common travel area and our place in Europe.  This morning, we announced a further 500 jobs which have come to Ireland.  Those people will be employed over the next couple of years, and there are more jobs to follow.<\/p>  <p>  I take Deputy Martin's point about the fishing industry whose representatives I met last evening.  The Deputy has seen the maps, the graphs and the figures in respect of the catch, both by volume and value, for Ireland of approximately 38%, which is significant.  They are very worried that because the way the Common Fisheries Policy was drafted many years ago, which is very complicated, and the many layers contained therein, we cannot trade one section for another just like that.  We regard that element as being an absolute priority along with the agrifood sector.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we should not separate those sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, in a hard Brexit where Britain has left the European Union, its exclusive waters would entitle it to substantial quotas.  That would put pressure on the industry here because of access in European waters.  These issues must be taken in the round with the other areas of the economy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, has met everybody in this regard.<\/p><p>We have had 11 sectoral dialogues on education, agrifood, transport, tourism, children, young people, jobs, enterprise and innovation.  There are three further all-island sectoral dialogues being hosted on energy, heritage, culture, rural Ireland, pensions, social welfare rights, social insurance, human rights, the Good Friday Agreement, seafood, agriculture and forestry.  Clearly the industries of rural Ireland will be taken into account.  I have to say those sectoral discussions have been very worthwhile because most people who have attended have real experience of the area in which they are working and their points are valid and must be taken into account.  It is all building up a compendium of voices of Ireland in respect of their sectors and businesses and how we will have to deal with this.  Believe me, it will not be a simple challenge.  We await the triggering of Article 50 and the letter of clarification to the European Commission from the British Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500028#AA01900","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487166300,"counter":273,"content":"<p>While the Taoiseach and Deputy Martin were speaking, I had a chance to research what people have said about this enormous development in European policy.

The Italian Minister with responsibility for Europe stated they want to have a core shared by everyone and specific policies in which certain countries can move ahead without other countries imposing a veto.  In the normal course of events this would be simply the old dispute between the old core European countries and newer countries.  The Taoiseach stated that recently he visited Poland.

On 20 December 2016, the Air Corps wrote to the HSA outlining its proposed improvement plan.  The Air Corps advised that it was fully committed to implementing the improved safety measures to protect workers from potential exposures to chemicals and will ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable.  The Air Corps improvement plan is being conducted over eight phases.  I am advised that seven out of the eight phases are planned to be completed by May 2017.  Additional risk assessment of particular chemicals, policy review and health surveillance and biological monitoring will also be considered.<\/p><p>As recognised in the HSA report of October 2016, the Air Corps had already commenced activities of improvement and was proactive in implementing change before, during and after the engagement with the HSA.<\/p><p>In addition to the HSA review, the Deputy is aware that, in September 2016, I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps, which I received in late 2015 and early 2016.

Last week there were details of text messages between the Chief Whip, Deputy Regina Doherty, and a whistleblower who had warned the Government of Air Corps staff exposure to cancer-causing chemicals while working at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  She undertook to contact the Minister for Defence about the matter.  In January 2015 she passed a message on to the whistleblower indicating that the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, would call the next day.  This is contrary to his claim that he was unaware of such an appeal.  Major inconsistencies have emerged in the Government's account of how it has managed the warnings it has received over concerns over Air Corps technicians' health.  None of the three whistleblowers has been contacted by Deputy Coveney or the current Minister for Defence since they made their disclosures more than a year ago.

My Government colleagues and I recognise the important role that the Reserve Defence Force has played in contributing to Ireland's defence capability, and in particular, to the voluntary service which has been the hallmark of the Reserve.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions two relate specifically to the RDF i.e. attracting recruits from all backgrounds and conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.   <\/p>  <p>Recruitment to both the PDF and RDF remains a priority in 2017. Membership of the RDF is voluntary and unpaid and the quest for recruits must compete with the other organisations within the voluntary sector. These conditions along with the unique demands of military service make the issue of attracting recruits a challenging one.

A total of 78 recruits were recruited to the RDF in 2016.  The Defence Forces will continue to process applications from the campaign through the various competition stages.  The rate of intake is disappointing.  I agree with the Deputy opposite entirely on that.  It reflects a number of factors, including the time the recruitment process took place, security clearances in particular, the high rate of no-shows at various stages throughout the induction campaign, the priority of keeping PDF recruitment at an appropriate level and the overhead of safe and effective training places on the resources of the PDF.

With every month that goes by in which we do not take people in, the Government is killing that organisation piece by piece.  It will not exist in a number of years.  That is a fact.

I tell the Minister of State in the Chamber today that what is happening is that those applications are sitting on someone's desk for months on end and they are not being processed.

Informal complaints can be resolved directly by the complainant with the assistance of a third party if required.  Such third party can include any member of the Defence Forces who has the trust and confidence of the complainant.

One hundred and fifty-five most courageous young men came back and they were called the \"Jadotville Jacks\" and told they were cowards just to make sure the establishment did not come under pressure.  Notwithstanding that demonisation, those men went on to live lives as full as they could and contribute to society.  If we have learned anything about bullying and whistleblowers, let us put it into practice.  I appeal to the Minister of State to review the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500037#KK00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1487171100,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that I have considered every possible angle with a view to awarding medals to the personnel of A Company.

I was at a well-attended public meeting on Monday night last week at St. Finian's national school in Waterville.<\/p><p>There was not standing room in the school.  The meeting was convened to seek support in the locality for a campaign for a new school.  The support from the community was evident.  A new school is very much needed and long overdue.<\/p> <p> The State has never provided a school for the people of Waterville.  The current building in which the children of the village and surrounding areas attend school was constructed by the British Government in 1913 and very little work has been done to it since.  Since 2008, approximately &euro;300,000 has been spent on maintaining the school and basic capital investment.  It was, however, sticking plaster expenditure as there was nothing significant to show for the investment.  The money went into a very old building that is very expensive to maintain.<\/p> <p> Waterville is bucking the trend for many rural communities as it is doing really well.  It is a place that is becoming very vibrant and where jobs are being created, which is wonderful to see.  However, with that comes an increase in the population in the area and the school population is no different from the general population in that it is growing and will grow further.  What is now a four-teacher school will soon become a five-teacher school.  The Department keeps telling the school authorities in Waterville that an extension is the only viable option available.  The problem is that the school is located on an extremely confined site of 1.5 acres.  The site is on an extremely busy road that is a busy tourism route.  Many large vehicles also travel on it.  If an extra classroom is provided on the site, there will be no play area and no outside recreational area for the children.  That is simply not good enough in this day and age.<\/p> <p> The cost of renovating and extending a building that is already more than 100 years old is astronomical and would not be money well spent.  A greenfield site is readily available in the village to the school.  I support the view of the school community that an extension is not adequate and that a new school is the only solution for Waterville.  I know that I speak for all of the Kerry Deputies when I say this because they have all expressed their support for the campaign.  The Minister has met the school principal, Gear&oacute;id Moran, who is doing excellent work, while his team of staff are doing wonderful work.  However, they are confined by the facility in which they are operating and can only do so much.  The environment is simply not responsive to the needs of modern education.  If we are serious about giving each and every child a top class education, we must prioritise schools such as the one in Waterville for replacement.<\/p> <p> Waterville is not in the commuter belt, but it has the same issues faced by many schools in it.  The building is inadequate and needs work.  A new building is required.  The Department must move beyond the current situation where it has sought drawings and further information and acknowledge that a new build is the only way to go.  I ask the Minister to spearhead the campaign to try to give the people of Waterville and future generations what they so thoroughly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500038#LL02300","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487172300,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I can well understand the concern of the school in Waterville and many others.<\/p>  <p>  I will put the Deputy in the picture in terms of the capital budget, the backdrop against which I must deal with requests such as the one he has made.  Every year we must provide approximately 20,000 new school places which roughly are split as follows: 15,000 for new students, given that there is a population bulge, and 5,000 replacement school places.  That gives the Deputy an indication of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy outlined the history of the school in question.  St. Finian's national school did make an application in December 2015 to the Department requesting a new school and the Department did engage with it, as the Deputy indicated, last August.  The Department examined school enrolments, the building and other factors.  At that stage it indicated that it would not be possible to advance a major project at that time but that it was open to undertaking work to improve the school's facilities.  Having been fairly stable, last year there was a significant increase in enrolment numbers at the school from 99 pupils to 111, just short of the number required for the appointment of a new teacher.  My Department has indicated to the school that it could seek to provide for additional needs with respect to an additional teacher coming on-stream.<\/p>  <p>  I must be honest and say that when one talks about a totally new build, a project must compete with all other projects where currently there is no accommodation available for pupils.  That is the difficulty.  That said, I am aware that the school submitted technical reports this month to my Department and we will assess them.  Only last year a meeting was held to address the future needs of the school.  We will look afresh in the building unit at the technical reports, but the backdrop of planning is against a very tight capital budget and the Department must decide on priorities on a rigorous technical appraisal.  We will look at the new technical documents submitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500039#MM00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1487172300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I must stress the urgency of this case and the Department must treat it as such.  The projections are that the enrolment numbers in the school will surpass 120 in the very near future.  The school simply cannot cater for that number.  There is not an option to extend the school; as such, the Department must treat the project as a priority and fast-track it.  The children of Waterville deserve the same treatment as children in the commuter belt or anywhere else in the country.  It is not too much to ask that once every 100 years a community look to have a new school built.  It is not the case that there is another school 2 km or 3 km away, there is not another school until one reaches Caherdaniel over Coomakista, 15 km away, or Aghatubrid national school near Caherciveen or Killeenleigh national school.  The school serves a huge hinterland and it is not acceptable in this day and age to have children in school in the current conditions.  I visited the school on numerous occasions during school hours and the children were packed into one classroom, in particular.  They are small children, but when they reach the age of 11 or 12 years, they will be twice the size and the classrooms will not be big enough for them.  A serious health and safety issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  I spent a limited amount of time in the past working in the area of special needs.  I also worked in an autism unit.  There are children in St. Finian's national school with special needs and the environment for them is completely unacceptable.  They deserve the same start in life as every other child, but they are not getting it.  The standard procedure in the Department for processing the application is not good enough.  We need more.  The staff room is 4 m X 4 m and inadequate.  More space is required.  I am also very concerned about the lack of a drop off and collection area.

The figures will indicate that we only replaced a handful of schools last year out of the 4,000 schools across the country.  It is very difficult to secure a replacement school.  I can understand how people object to the procedures, but they are dictated by financial constraints.

We will seek to enact this legislation for the start of school year 2017-18.<\/blockquote><p>At the end of last year, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 went through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and has yet to be taken on Committee Stage.  One point in respect of this that I would like to raise is capacity and how this affects school admissions.  How will this Bill help parents in Fingal?  I am raising this Topical Issue matter with the Minister given the incredible urgency that exists to increase capacity in Dublin Fingal and schools in north County Dublin where parents are being told that there are no places for their children in September.  Parents are contacting me in large volumes.  They are worried sick because they have nowhere to send their child.  They are worried there are no places, that these children are too old for preschool placements and that there are no alternatives.  Years after putting their children's names down, they are being told that, come September, their efforts will be redundant because there is no room and the children will not be admitted.<\/p><p>I live in the fastest growing county in the country.  We have a growing young population which means that, effectively, this problem will only get worse.  Obviously, I do not mean children are the problem.  Children are lovely.  I mean that the problem of where they are to be taught will get worse.  I will read out some of the e-mails I have received.  One related to a school in Swords.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>We have a son already attending the school and our second son, who was 4 last December and will be ready for school in September.  With this in mind and as he already has a sibling attending the school we assumed that he would automatically get his school place in September.  We enrolled him with the school last month only to receive the news last Thursday that he was 24th on a waiting list of over 100 children for a place in the school.  So basically he has no place in our local school ... We were also informed that our son has no place in his preschool in September because the pre-school were of the opinion he would be starting school in September.  His place was offered to a younger child.  He also misses out on his free pre-school place due to his age and date of birth.<\/blockquote><p>Another e-mail involved a school in Balbriggan.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>I have a daughter who will be 4 years of age on the 27th of February, 2017.  We enrolled her last year.  Today we received a letter to say they cannot offer her a placement for September as all placements were filled from category 2 of the Enrolment Policy.  This category is in relation to child's age.  The cut off is the end of March which she meets.  Brothers and sisters of present pupils of the school, which she meets ... She is from the catchment area ... we have been here for 17 years and is Catholic.  On phoning the school I was told that they had a lot of older children applying for places this year.<\/blockquote><p>Problems are rolling over from one year to the next and are having knock-on effects.  Problems getting one cohort into school in one year means these children are applying again the next year as older children thus preventing other children coming through from getting a place.<\/p><p>Will the Minister advise me as to what I should tell these people?  I received another e-mail from parents who want to send their child to a Gaeilscoil.  They are Gaeilgeoir&iacute;, something we should be encouraging.  They have had their child's name down for three years and have just been informed there is no place.  There is issue with under-capacity.  I am sure it is not exclusive to my constituency but I believe it is a more acute problem there.  I want to know what I can say to those people.  Their children deserve a place in school.

Pre-legislative hearings on some of these issues are taking place within the committee.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that there is population pressure in Swords.  My Department is reviewing the demographic data for the Swords school planning area as part of its general assessment.  My Department also has been in direct contact with a number of primary schools in the Swords area in respect of their junior infant capacity.  In that regard, it is understood that at least one school is undersubscribed and has expressed a willingness to enrol further junior infants in September 2017, if necessary.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in school planning areas to ensure one school is not expanding at the expense or the viability of another school.<\/p>  <p>  There are about 13 different planning areas in the north Dublin area.  Four new schools have been built since 2011, so this is an area where there is continuing expansion.  The demographic data are being reviewed again to see whether we are at a point where additional capacity needs to be planned for.  As of today, the Department's assessment is that the need of junior infants enrolling in the schools in the Swords area will be met by the available places.  Unfortunately, that does not always mean that a parent applying to the school of their preference gets the school they wanted.  I know some schools have longer waiting lists.  That is the current position.  The Department will continue to assess needs.  The building programme seeks to respond to the pressure of population demand.<\/p>  <p>  It goes back to the point I made to Deputy Griffin.  Each year, we must deliver 20,000 additional school places.  The planning is such that it is only when the demographic need is clearly established that we trigger construction.  That is the only way we can meet the pressure of demand but we are meeting that demand.

It concerns the age of the population there.  It is a serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am still not sure what I will say to those parents who are deeply distressed and not just because their children cannot go to the local school.  There are parents who have tried schools in the area and who cannot get their children admitted.  This is only February.  My prediction is that this will get worse because more parents are going to hear about it as these things happen.  They are going to pick up the phone and question the school and they are going to be told the same thing.  If a person is No. 24 on a waiting list of 100, I do not think the Minister is suggesting that those 100 pupils can be accommodated in the one school in Swords that has a bit of capacity.

As the Minister of State will know, Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, has been providing an ambulance service to the citizens of the city and county since 1898.  That is almost 150 years.  Uniquely, all firefighters are also paramedics and rotate between fire and ambulance duties.  The dual role they have of fire-based emergency medical service is internationally recognised.  It is also recognised as best practice.  It is replicated in cities such as Seattle, New York, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt etc.  The beauty of it is that Dublin is recognised as having the second best survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the world after Seattle.

International best practice indicates that combining fire rescue and emergency services greatly improves the response to a crisis.  That was clearly seen in the case of the Stardust tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  SIPTU is balloting for strike action at the moment.  All indications are that the go-ahead will be given for strike action.  The key issue is that the Dublin Fire Brigade is being starved of resources and support to do its job.

The bottom line is that the DFB ambulance service and its structure work extremely well, as my colleagues have outlined.  What Fianna F&aacute;il as a party and the members of the DFB are really concerned about is the removal of the delivery of that service from the DFB.  The reason they are so efficient is because they manage it themselves.  They are all trained paramedics and can work with any of the appliances.  We saw it with the terrible bus crash in Dublin.  Everyone who is on that rig is a trained paramedic.  It works.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council and Mr. Owen Keegan have an issue with funding and that is all it is.  The HSE is looking to amalgamate this.  The DFB complements the HSE ambulance service.  This is not a turf war issue.

I ask the Minister of State to do that and to raise it with her senior Minister.

I give my apologies for not being Deputy Coveney or Deputy Harris.  I am taking this on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who gives his apologies.  If there are commitments I cannot give, I will certainly take the requests of the Deputies back to both Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies know, Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county by arrangement between Dublin City Council and the HSE.  The HSE National Ambulance Service provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area as well as non-emergency patient transport.  I take this opportunity to commend the excellent work that is completed by the people that undertake that work for the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.  In recent years, three comprehensive reviews of our ambulance services have been undertaken: the HIQA review, the independent Lightfoot review of National Ambulance Service capacity and the review of Dublin ambulance services that was jointly commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity review, published last year, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  The review identified deficits in ambulance capacity, including in the Dublin area, which will require very significant investment to address, as the Deputies have pointed out.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  To this end, increased funding has been made available for ambulance services in the HSE national service plan for this year.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA report on ambulance services, which was published in December 2014, highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns around the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  The HIQA report points very clearly to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.  The Dublin ambulance services review, which was commissioned in 2014, is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety, capacity and value for money for ambulance services.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the House that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is fully aware and appreciative of the excellent historical tradition of service provided to the citizens of Dublin by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  However, at the same time, it is fully accepted that in the interest of patient safety we need the DFB and the NAS to have a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to service delivery.  It is important that we optimise and maximise all available resources to ensure the citizens of Dublin have the most responsive and safest ambulance service possible, which I know we all agree on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has not as yet received a copy of the final report on the review of Dublin ambulance services, which, as I mentioned, was commissioned by Dublin City Council and the HSE.  However, to be clear, if any change to the model of service delivery is required, a formal proposal for those changes will have to be submitted to both the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, for their consideration and approval.  To that end, discussions are taking place between officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The Departments have requested a joint action plan from the HSE and DCC with regard to service and governance issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500041#OO01000","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1487173500,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I have seven points to make in 60 seconds.

It is not necessarily a moral obligation, but I believe that obligation has been well established after 150 years.  The fire-emergency medical service model is the best model for an urban area.  All expert reports point to that.  The dual qualification makes the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service very efficient on the public purse.  The Dublin Fire Brigade is very used to emergencies.

This is a case of Owen Keegan in Dublin City Council not wanting to fund it.  We need to sort it out because we will not accept any changes to this service.  It is a very serious issue for us and for all other parties which care about this service.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board the comments we have raised, which I know she will do.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, there has been no consultation whatsoever with Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, ambulance or their employee representatives.

It is a crisis that the Government promised in its programme for Government would be resolved within 100 days yet a year on it continues to get worse, not better, on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Yesterday's news of the escalating crisis was the <i>Daft.ie<\/i>report showing that the biggest increase in rental inflation ever recorded by <i>Daft.ie<\/i>since its inception, 13.5%, occurred in the last quarter of 2016.  Dublin rents are now rising at a rate of 15%.  Rents in Dublin are up 65% from their lowest point and 14% from their highest point before the crash in 2008.  Average rents in Dublin are now &euro;1,643 per month.  In Cork, they are &euro;1,096 per month while in Galway, they are &euro;975 per month.  They are &euro;875 per month in Limerick and &euro;745 per month in Waterford.  Even with the Minister's rent certainty measures, another 4% can be put on that.  Another 4% on rents in Dublin will bring the average rent cost up to over &euro;1,700.  In every category of rental property and in every single area, the rent allowance or housing assistance payment limits are very considerably less than the average rental levels.  We have now also record levels of people in the rental market, at 475,000, which is an increase of 150,000 over the past five years, yet there are fewer than 4,000 rental properties available for rent, and most of them are unaffordable to anybody on a low or middle income.<\/p><p>The Minister's plan is not working.  Even if his plan is to deliver increased supply - the magical mantra of the market - and that he will have 20,000 extra residential units a year, if I understand his plan, there will still be a massive surplus of demand over supply, even if his plan works, for years to come.  That means there will be no pressure on landlords to reduce rents.  For years to come, even if the Minister's plan works, rents will not decrease, and they are already unaffordable and continue to rise.  The Minister has got to change tack or the situation will get worse.<\/p><p>I want to know what the Minister intends to do about this problem.  If the HAP limit in Dublin is &euro;1,300 and average rents are &euro;1,600, how is somebody supposed to afford that?  What are they supposed to do when they have nowhere to live?  It is just not doable.  If we think about it, 60% or 70% of an average worker's income is required to pay rent if they can get a property, and they probably cannot even get a property.  It is just not doable.<\/p><p>We are asking for a radical change in tack to pin rents back to affordable levels, which means retrospectively reducing rents to something like 2010 and 2011 levels, and then have the rent certainty operating from there as well as a dramatic increase in council housing provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500042#PP00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1487174100,"counter":471,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and the <i>Daft.ie<\/i>report on rent increases, it is clear that there are acute rent pressures in the rental market; we all know that.  Those pressures are driven by a number of factors - rising demand, lack of supply and the high costs indebted landlords face in servicing their loans.  Those stresses are again confirmed in the latest data from the <i>Daft.ie<\/i>rental report but as I have said publicly, that is not a surprise.  We know this is happening and it is what we are trying to address.  That is the reason we are putting plans in place.<\/p><p>The report shows that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average of 13.5% in 2016.  In Dublin, annual rental inflation is at an average of 15% and strong rent inflation is also seen in Dublin&rsquo;s commuter counties.  These increases are placing huge pressures on tenants, particularly those who are seeking new accommodation.  We want to tackle that problem and as I said at an event this morning, and at a housing conference yesterday, we want to change the housing numbers for two reasons, namely, for social housing to give people that choice but also economically this will hold us back.  We cannot provide accommodation for people, companies cannot grow, we cannot expand and we cannot continue to create new jobs.<\/p><p>We want to do this, and we fully intend to do it, but it is wrong to say that we promised to do it within 100 days.  That is not what we said.  We promised to put in place an action plan that would tackle this problem over a couple of years.  It is not possible to magically come up with a solution overnight.  Deputy Boyd Barrett gives the impression that if we click our fingers, the problem will be solved.  It does not work that way.  There was no plan in place that was backed with money.  A plan has been put in place now.  It was put together over the summer in fewer than 100 days, as per the commitment, and published in July.  It will be rolled out bit by bit from August-September onwards.<\/p><p>It should be borne in mind that this report refers to the period prior to the Government's new strategy for the rental sector, which was published in December as part of the overall housing plan, and prior to the rent pressure zones announced at the same time.<\/p><p>There is no doubt the problems in the rental sector are part of a bigger issue.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis and the problems caused by high rents reflect, and are reflected in, the other issues facing the housing market.  There are not enough homes for first-time buyers, while there is an increased demand for social housing, with unacceptable levels of homelessness.  The issue is the lack of supply.  All of the actions outlined in Rebuilding Ireland are aimed at increasing the supply of housing.  Likewise, in the rental strategy which was published in December we are trying to get the balance right between rent control in certain areas to ensure only minor increases and encouraging increased investment in the rental market.  We have to do both.  We are trying to win new investment in the rental sector to have more houses provided because we cannot fix this problem overnight and build all of the houses needed.<\/p> <p> It is wrong to say nothing is happening in the housing plans.  Last year approximately 15,000 new houses came onstream.  The plan in 2017 is for approximately 18,000 to come onstream, but we now expect to see up to 19,000, as there is no doubt that we will beat the number of 18,000.  We want to reach 25,000 a year.  I made it very clear to the construction sector at meetings held today that if we could get to 28,000 or 29,000 new housing units a year for several years to help us to catch up with demand, that is what we would do.  The aim at the end of the five-year plan is to have new 25,000 houses per year thereafter, but in the middle of the plan we will probably go a little higher because we will need to do so if we are to catch up.  The Deputy is absolutely right in that regard.<\/p> <p> Coupled with this, we have efforts and had new plans announced to try to bring vacant stock back into use as social housing.  More than 5,000 voids have been brought back into use in the past two years, with 2,000 being provided last year alone because we had provided the money to do so.  We are putting in place the repair and lease back initiative which involves cash upfront to private owners to bring their houses back into usage as social housing.  There are other plans such as the buy and renew initiative for local authorities.  We are supplying money in new areas to make this happen.  The capital budget for housing in 2017 has been increased by 50%.  We are reacting to this and a total of &euro;5.5 billion of taxpayer's money is being committed to fixing the problem, but we cannot spend all of it in one day.  The Deputy should not kid himself.  It takes time to put a system back in place.  The system of social housing provision was closed down well before Fine Gael entered government, as the Deputy knows.  We agree with him and are trying to build it back up again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500042#PP00900","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487174700,"counter":473,"content":"<p>The problem is that it just gets worse.  If there was any sign that things were improving, I would give some credence to what the Minister of State said.  It is not that the debate started today or yesterday or even a year ago.  When I stood at the top of the Chamber in 2012 and warned that there woujld be slum conditions similar to those in Sean O'Casey's time, I remember that I was scoffed at from the Fine Gael benches.  There was laughter across the Chamber because it could not possibly happen, but it is.  Last week there was a newspaper report on a property in Lehaunstown.  Today there is a newspaper report that a three-bedroom property with 16 bunk beds is being advertised to young women and rented out at &euro;400 per bunk bed.  The journalist who went into the place said it was absolutely squalid.  We are back to tenement conditions and none of the measures proposed by the Minister of State will address the problems immediately.  For example, a simple thing that could be done is, as we proposed in a motion passed by Dublin City Council, that the local authority should have the power to take and use any property which has been sitting empty for longer than six months if the owner does not signal an intention to use it.  However, the city manager stated he would not implement it.  I propose that he be instructed to implement the measure.  It is completely unacceptable.  I also propose that rents in the rent pressure zones be pinned back to affordable levels - approximately 2010 levels - as an emergency measure to make them affordable in order that everybody looking for rental property would not automatically be in a crisis, as is the case because rents are too high and HAP and rent support levels are simply not sufficient.  Will the Minister of State do these things?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1487174700,"counter":474,"content":"<p>We have made the decision that in the rent pressure zones there will be a limit on increases to a maximum of 4%, one third of the rates in the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report today.  The report reflects the situation before we published the rental strategy.  Our intervention in these areas will help.  I understand the Deputy wants us to move further backwards, but that is not something we are in a position to do.  We have a rental strategy agreed to by all of the Cabinet which we believe has the balance right between trying to have predictability in rents in some key pressure zones and adding pressure zones where the evidence is available and encouraging more investment in the sector.  If we cut off investment, we will have a bigger problem.<\/p><p>I recall the Deputy speaking in 2012 and fully compliment him ae flagged this issue, but I state repeatedly that the resources were not available.  I wish they had been available in 2012 and 2013 to be spent on social housing but they were not.  It became a real issue in 2014 and 2015 when we could see rents increasing.  In areas in Dublin they have doubled from &euro;700 to &euro;1,400 in the past two or three years.  They were not at these levels in 2012 or 2013, but they were in 2014 and 2015.  I am saying the Deputy was right, but we did not have the resources we needed available.  Now we have money to tackle the problem and have a plan in place to spend it . I have no doubt that it will make an impact.  We cannot fix the problem overnight in the way the Deputy wants us to do so.  He has a magic pen with which he could go and do it, but it does not work that way for us.  We must crank the system back up, intervene where we can and put in place resources to activate sites and have State-owned land put back into use.  The Deputy is correct on initiatives to bring vacant properties back into use.<\/p><p>On the motion mentioned by the Deputy, we have the site levy to be introduced in 2019.  We have received advice from the Attorney General that we cannot intervene before then.  In the meantime we will use carrots to try to get people to bring properties back into use.  If the county manager wants to attempt to do this, so be it.  I am not sure whether he would legally be able to do so.  I understand what is behind the motion, but we are trying to use the carrot approach.  We are asking people who have accommodation not in use to talk to and work with us through the various arms of the State.  We can lease long-term or give them money upfront to bring the accommodation back into use.  If people own land, we will work with them to service it to have it brought back into use.  We will try all of these measures.  We will get a better response in adopting that approach for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487174700,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.15 p.m. and resumed at 4.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Brexit and Special Designation for Northern Ireland: Motion [Private Members]","time":1487175300,"counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500044#UU00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487175300,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 22 May 1998, voters in Northern Ireland voted to accept the Good Friday Agreement, GFA, by 71.1% to 28.9%, and in Ireland by 94.39% to 5.61%;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; since the GFA was ratified and the restoration of power-sharing in 2007, the European Union, EU, has been a critical partner for peace, providing substantial political and financial aid, which has led to greater economic and social progress on an all-island basis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 23 June 2016, a referendum on the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the EU took place;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a majority of voting citizens in Northern Ireland, namely 55.8%, voted to remain in the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the British Government has now made clear that they will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March 2017, and begin the exit process, and will also be seeking to leave the single market in a so-called &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo;; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this situation is unprecedented, as no member state has left the EU and single market before now;<br \/><br \/>recognises that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; under the terms of the GFA there is an inherent right for those born on this island to Irish citizenship, and by virtue of that right, citizenship of the EU as well;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Northern Ireland is being forced to leave the EU against the expressed wishes of its people;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this represents a major set-back for the political process in Northern Ireland and directly challenges the integrity of the GFA, and will have huge consequences for the protections contained within it, especially the principle of consent;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the pursuit of a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; may well impose the amendment of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which gives legislative competence and authority to the GFA;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, in its June 2015 report, UK-EU Future Relationship: Implications for Ireland, recommended that &lsquo;the Irish and UK Governments negotiate bilaterally to have Northern Ireland recognised (in an EU context) as having &ldquo;a special position&rdquo; in the UK, in view of the Good Friday Agreement.

We are seeking to formalise the position of the D&aacute;il in favour of special status for the North within the European Union, and to call on the Government to adopt that position.  The Government amendment is not acceptable and Sinn F&eacute;in will vote against it.  The AAA-PBP amendment, from a party which urged voters in the North to support Brexit, is also not acceptable.<\/p><p> The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment accepts almost all our motion and adds a number of matters relating to the Good Friday Agreement, including the bill of rights, protection for the human rights elements of the agreement, future funding streams of PEACE and INTERREG.

That reflects the deep flaw in the Government&rsquo;s approach to Brexit.  The Government is still thinking within the confines of the Twenty-six Counties state.  It is not thinking of the future or of the historic nature of this Brexit move by, essentially, a majority of people in England and Wales.<\/p> <p> The Government's position is dictated by what Britain wants.  It also reflects the deep-rooted partitionism that infects the body politic in this State.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s starting point was that the North is a part of the United Kingdom and if that state pulls out of the EU then so, too, must the North.  That ignores the widespread opposition on this island to partition, including within the Fine Gael Party.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, while he does not say it publicly, wants to see an end to partition, and a united Ireland, as much as the rest of us.  The Taoiseach's position also ignores the Good Friday Agreement which recognises-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500044#UU00400","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487175600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The Good Friday Agreement is the foundation stone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500045#VV00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487175600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>An Teachta Adams without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500045#VV00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487175600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  It also ignores the fact that the European Union is not the United States of Europe.  It ignores the Good Friday Agreement which recognises the unique status of the North.  As the Taoiseach said today, the EU is not a homogenous unit.  On the contrary, part of its strength lies in its diversity.  While we remain critical of the EU, including its two-tier structure, its lack of democratic accountability and a lack of proper citizen-based arrangements, it has demonstrated flexibility in coming forward with pragmatic arrangements for dealing with complex situations.  For example, Greenland, a Danish dependent territory with limited devolution, voted to leave the EU in 1985 while Denmark remained as a member state.  Greenland was then transferred to the overseas countries and territories status.  A trilateral declaration agreement now exists between Greenland, Denmark and the EU.  Some 25 overseas countries and territories have a special relationship status with the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach believe it is beyond the ability of the people of this island to shape out a special arrangement for the North arising from Brexit or is he afraid of having to negotiate with the British on an issue which they have already set their face against?  It is something I have experienced many times with successive Irish governments.  They figure out where the British are at and then cut their cloth to meet that, instead of acting in our own national interests.  There would have been no Good Friday Agreement had that approach been taken at that time.  Therefore, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  No Irish government should meekly accept the rejection by a blow-in British Secretary of State that Britain will not accept a special designated status for the North.  Last week, the British Government set out its stall.  In the British Parliament it ignored the imperative of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Conservative Party, the DUP, the Ulster Unionist Party - the favoured partner of the SDLP - and UKIP, as well as the MP for Bexley and Sidcup, James Brokenshire, combined to vote down any protections for the Good Friday Agreement.  So much for the assurances to the Taoiseach by Theresa May.  That is no great surprise for those of us who know that British Governments always act in their own national self-interest.  They do not give a tuppenny damn about the North.  Nowhere is this better illustrated than in England's treatment of the devolved Governments.  Nicola Sturgeon has expressed her disquiet at the London Government&rsquo;s attitude towards Scotland.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party&rsquo;s experience to date, having taken part in meetings of the Joint Ministerial Committee, is that the British Government does not care one jot about the devolved administrations.  Therefore, things have got to change.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called on the Taoiseach and the Government to agree a strategic approach to the negotiations with clear political, economic and trade objectives.  They must protect the interests of all citizens on the island of Ireland, defend the Good Friday Agreement, and ensure that the frontier between the EU and Britain is not on the island of Ireland.  That means upholding the democratic vote in the North to remain, which is the aim of this motion.  It also requires the Government, which has a seat at the negotiating table, to actively campaign for the North to have a special designated status within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to tonight&rsquo;s motion, to try to advance this objective, I introduced the European Communities (Brexit) Bill 2017 in the D&aacute;il last week.  The Bill places a statutory requirement on the Taoiseach to outline the Government&rsquo;s approach to negotiations surrounding Brexit to the Oireachtas.  I hope we will have the opportunity to debate that Bill soon.<\/p>  <p>  All this is critical to the well-being and future of the Good Friday Agreement.  Thus far, the Government has failed to act decisively as a co-equal guarantor of that agreement.  The dangers which this presents are enormous.  This British Government has no great investment in the Good Friday Agreement.  We already know that it intends to bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  It is also committed to ending its relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights.  These decisions will have profound implications for the agreement.  None of this deals with the fact that, under the terms of the Agreement, citizens in the North have a right to Irish citizenship and, therefore, to EU citizenship.  How can those rights be protected and realised?<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there have been a succession of economic reports, including one recently by the ESRI, which warned that Brexit will cost tens of thousands of jobs across the island.  Some 14,000 people regularly commute across the Border for work, business and education.  If we do not work, act and co-operate together in setting clear targets, the trucks and goods that cross that Border every day on their way to Europe will now face customs checks from Dundalk to Letterkenny.  That is a lot of jobs at risk and a very messy process.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, this is about the future.  As a matter of urgency the Irish Government must set out its strategy and objectives in the Brexit negotiations.  That is what this motion aims to do.  It is about upholding the democratic vote of citizens on this island to remain, and to act in the national interests of the whole island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500045#VV00400","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1487175600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>In recent weeks, we saw the House of Commons's committee of experts giving the plain and unvarnished legal facts about what Brexit from the customs union really means.  It means a border in our country unless we do something about it.  This weekend in my county, communities from Lifford and Bridgend will demand as Border communities that there be no return to the hard Border that so many of us grew up with and detested.  Those communities, including farmers, businessmen and businesswomen, and workers from across the country, North and South, do not want platitudes or sympathy.  They want a united political effort to prevent the imposition of any border in this country.<\/p>  <p>  In today's media we hear that despite the words we have heard from the Government this evening, the Government is planning for a return to that Border.  Sites across the Border are being identified for customs posts, including in my own county of Donegal as well as in Louth, Monaghan and elsewhere.  That is the reality and wishful thinking, but it is not enough to accept that.<\/p>  <p>  A short time ago at the finance committee, the Minister for Finance confirmed to me that is indeed what is happening - that Revenue is scouting out sites for customs posts along our Border, confirming the media reports earlier today.  That is why Sinn Fein has moved this motion.  The solution in the immediate term is a special status for the Six Counties within the European Union.  Let Trump talk all he wants about walls, Ireland should be talking about uniting the country.  A hard Border is the same as a wall. <\/p><p>It disrupts and it divides.  The North must therefore continue to have access to the Single Market which allows for the free movement of our people, goods, services and capital on a North-South basis and among the other EU member states, helping that part of our island to benefit from the largest single trading block on earth.  It is also about remaining part of the common travel area to maintain the free movement of people and goods without trade tariffs, physical checks or passport controls while opposing any suggestion of external international EU land borders or border controls within the island either by land, air or sea.  We all know that the imposition of customs controls will not only have obvious consequences for businesses involved in cross-Border trade but will also reduce the effectiveness and even the viability of an all-Ireland supply chain, something which could be of particular importance, of course, in the agrifood sector, a sector which could stand to benefit substantially through heightened all-Ireland co-operation in areas such as animal health, plant health, food labelling, State aids and veterinary services.  Let us not forget the significant movement of agricultural products across the Border today.  In 2015, bulk milk imports into the South for processing by creameries and pasteuries amounted to 594 million litres, with nearly all of it coming from North of the Border.  This is equivalent to 9% of our domestic Southern supplies and 26% of the Northern annual milk supplies.<\/p> <p> What do we need to do?  Our capital programme must focus on cross-Border projects like never before.  Every policy lever at our disposal must be used to prevent the Border effect getting a hold on our economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in's four MEPs are putting forward realistic and practical proposals to mitigate the effect of Brexit on our country.  Unfortunately, the Government simply has not got it.  I reiterate that we need special status for the North within the European Union.  The usual talk, wishful thinking and diplomatic meekness will not work.  People are fed up with it.  What do references to \"seamless borders\" or \"the need to avoid a return to the Border of the past\" mean?  When it is spelled out in hard facts, it means what is happening as we speak with Revenue officials going to identify sites in Donegal at Bridgend, Lifford, Pettigo and all other Border crossings for customs posts.<\/p> <p> This is an issue of unprecedented importance North and South and the people have had the chance to speak about it.  A clear majority in the North wants to stay.  Border communities want to hear tonight that we are putting forward solutions and ideas and not just sleepwalking our country into the worst possible Brexit.  There has been a great deal of talk about what Britain can or will do.  Diplomatically, we have to push the EU to be flexible but we are only a small part of that block and must punch above our weight.  As much as we need to negotiate hard with the British, we need to negotiate hard with the Commission and other EU member states.  Our interests are not the same as those of Greece, Portugal or Estonia on these issues.  We cannot be lost in EU committee-speak.  Where we need to, we must raise our voices and make our demands clear.  The motion before us sets out a clear and achievable demand if the political will is there.  Let the House stand together and for all of the people of Ireland.  Let it recognise, represent and respect the will of the people of the North and let us pass the motion to allow us to campaign for a special status for the North within the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500045#VV00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487176200,"counter":486,"content":"<p>The people of the North have the right to be Irish citizens.  Hundreds of thousands in the North today are Irish citizens and the number is growing.  This makes them EU citizens and the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In a few short years, these Irish and EU citizens will be stranded under an increasingly isolated London Government.  The foundation stone for the hard-won peace process in the North has been the notion of consent.  Consent has been pivotal to the development of stability.  The majority of the people of the North have voted to remain in the EU and they have not consented to be sundered from the developing all-Ireland economy.  The London Government seeks to throw this consent in the dustbin of history.  The Minister has a responsibility in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Self-determination is pivotal to republican political ideology.  Ireland was on its knees 100 years ago.  One of the worst famines in European history was still a vivid memory for many.  The country had been emptied of nearly 3 million people through death and emigration.  Given that the Union Jack flew over every town in the country for hundreds of years, representing the largest empire the world had ever seen, freedom and self-determination must have seemed impossible.  To a growing number of Irish men and women, however, it was clear that self-determination was an absolute necessity for survival.  They set about a revolution that changed the course of all our lives.  Just a few dozen miles up the road in towns such as Newry, Armagh and Enniskillen, Irish people have democratically self-determined that they wish to remain in the EU.  However, for those people not much has changed in the last 100 years.  The North remains a forgotten backwater, hardly featuring on the home counties' Tory radar.  Shockingly, the pivotal self-determination of the Northern electorate in regard to Brexit is being ignored and disregarded by London.  Shockingly, what happens to the Border on this island and to our national interest remain beyond our democratic control 100 years after the Rising.<\/p>  <p>  Unbelievable as it may seem, I produced last year the first report since partition of an Oireachtas committee on the all-Ireland economy.  Despite all our talk of the all-Ireland economy, precious little research has been done on it.  For the report, I interviewed hundreds of people of differing backgrounds throughout the island of Ireland including academics, businesspeople, trade unionists, trade organisations, public representatives, farmers, State officials and local authority representatives, all of whom said our future was stronger in an all-Ireland economy.  All of that will come to nothing if Brexit continues on its current trajectory.  We are told that Britain and the North will leave the Single Market and the customs union.  We are told the free movement of people between Britain and the EU will end.  We are told product, service, environment and labour regulations will diverge on these two islands.  In the same breath, we are told it will be okay.  This is dangerous nonsense.  That circle cannot be squared through all the negotiation and goodwill in the world and especially not by a subservient Government sitting on its hands.  The only way the will and consent of the people of the North can be fulfilled is if the North remains within the EU.  The only future for the Good Friday Agreement is in the context of the EU.  The only hope for an all-Ireland economy is if the North receives special status within the EU and the only way that will happen is if the Government opposite gets off its docile butt and starts to campaign with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500046#WW00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1487176200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;notes that:&mdash; while the result of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s (UK) European Union (EU) membership referendum of 23rd June, 2016, was not what the Government would have wished for, it respects the outcome of the democratic process in the UK and the decision of its electorate to leave the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recognising its value and benefits, Ireland will remain a fully committed member of the EU and continue to play an active role in the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the outcome of the UK referendum creates particular concerns in Northern Ireland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Brexit presents significant and unique challenges for Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Northern Ireland and the protection of the peace process are central concerns for the Government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations, in addition to the other stated priorities such as economy and trade, the Common Travel Area and the future of the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), an international agreement registered with the United Nations, remains the foundation for all our engagements on Northern Ireland and remains in force whatever the status of the UK within the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the GFA, which was endorsed by the people of this island, North and South, includes the principle of consent and the possibility of a change in constitutional status in Northern Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government, as co-guarantor of the GFA, has emphasised at every opportunity in extensive discussions on Brexit with all EU member state Governments (including the UK Government), with members of the European Parliament, the EU Commission and other EU institutions that the principles and provisions of the GFA must be fully respected in any future agreement between the EU and the UK; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has clearly and repeatedly stated and demonstrated its commitment to working urgently and intensively with our EU partners, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to see how collectively we can ensure that the gains of the peace process in the last two decades are fully protected in whatever post-exit arrangements are negotiated;recognises the progress that had been made through the North South Ministerial Council in scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing joint principles for moving forward, including:&mdash; recognition of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, bearing in mind its geography and history;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensuring that the treaties and agreements between Ireland and the UK are fully taken into account;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; protecting the free movement of people, goods, capital and services; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; maintaining the economic and social benefits of co-operation on both sides of the border; andfurther notes that:&mdash; the re-establishment of devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible after the upcoming elections on 2nd March, 2017, will be important in ensuring effective local political representation at this critical time in the Brexit process;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government, as co-guarantor of the GFA, and its institutions will work to support the political parties in Northern Ireland in this regard;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Northern Ireland is included in the EU&rsquo;s list of negotiation priorities following an intensive diplomatic initiative by the Irish Government; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government remains committed to ensuring that the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland including all aspects of the GFA are fully considered in the upcoming negotiations and securing the best possible outcome for all of the people on the island of Ireland.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to move the Government's amendment and to acknowledge that this is a very important debate in the context of a critical issue, namely the matter of Northern Ireland and the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  This is a major strategic challenge to the island of Ireland and a matter of great concern to all of us in the House and beyond.  We face acute challenges to our economy and trade as well as in relation to Northern Ireland.  I assure the House that the Government continues in a determined way to work closely with our European partners to ensure that they understand issues like the common travel area and our right to continue its operation, consistent with EU law, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the UK from the Union.  Brexit is very much at the top of our agenda and has been since well before the referendum vote in the UK.  It is top of the agenda in every Department and that is doubly so for my Department and that of the Taoiseach.  The challenges of Brexit are multifaceted as indeed is our response.  Across every Department, a substantial programme of work is well under way.<\/p><p>For the last eight months, I have been working closely with the Taoiseach, briefing governments in the European Union on our priorities and highlighting Ireland's approach and position to partner countries outside the European Union.<\/p><p>I have had over 150 high level meetings and discussions to date.  Most recently, last week I travelled to Brussels where I met EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, the European Parliament's representative Guy Verhofstadt and leading and influential MEPs from the Parliament and held formal meetings with foreign ministers from Italy and Finland. <\/p> <p> While I was in Brussels the Taoiseach was in Warsaw holding bilateral talks with the Polish Prime Minister.  The diplomatic programme undertaken by the Taoiseach and all of my Government colleague, including the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, is buttressed by an intensive programme of engagements at official level and discussions with officials in the Commission, and member state Governments are continuing.<\/p> <p> At national level an enormous programme of work has been undertaken.  Ireland alone was in a position to publish a framework contingency plan on the day of the UK referendum result.  The work across Government is intensive and relentless.  It has been co-ordinated and led by the Taoiseach.  To the suggestion in the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment of a Minister for Brexit, I reiterate that the strategic challenge of Brexit is a job for the entire Cabinet led by the head of the Cabinet and Government, the Taoiseach.  All Ministers in Government have their part to play, as do all political parties North and South.<\/p> <p> As regards Northern Ireland, the Government has been clear that there are entirely unique circumstances that must be taken into account in the matter of the negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the Union and the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The Good Friday Agreement, an international treaty registered with United Nations, provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland which is the foundation of the peace process.  This is something the European Union as a whole has always recognised and has been supportive of.  I have received heartening support from my foreign ministerial colleagues in that regard.<\/p> <p> It is worth recalling that the Good Friday Agreement recognises the birthright of all of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and to be accepted as Irish, British or both.  This means that virtually everybody born in Northern Ireland can, as of right, choose to be an Irish citizen and, therefore, a citizen of the European Union with all of the rights and obligations of both.  There is no parallel for this anywhere in Europe, a point I have continued to highlight with my colleagues.<\/p> <p> The Agreement also contains very important provisions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  The Government has been clear that Brexit must cause no legal impediment to the mechanism set out in the Agreement for a united Ireland, in accordance with the principle of consent, and this point is specifically referenced in the Government's counter-motion.<\/p> <p> The European Union is, first and foremost, a peace project and the Union has made immense contributions to the peace process on the island of Ireland over the past two decades and longer.  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, Members of the European Parliament and senior representatives of the Commission and Council, I know there is a deep appreciation of the role of the European Union and the contribution it has made in support of the peace process, and they wish to continue that support regardless of the challenges and changes resulting from Brexit.<\/p> <p> At the core of both Opposition motions is a specific request for the Government to adopt a position whereby Northern Ireland remains in the European Union with a special status post-Brexit.  The UK's withdrawal from the Union is patently not something that this Government or anyone in the House wanted.  The Government actively engaged and advocated for just the opposite during the referendum campaign in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Our task now is to face up to the unwanted result and outcome, with all of the challenges that brings, in order to secure what will be the best outcome for the island of Ireland as a whole.<\/p> <p> The cold reality is that, notwithstanding the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, concepts and terms like \"special status\" give rise to serious concerns for other EU partners about precedents that might be set elsewhere.  This would risk undermining the efforts of the Government to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island and the people of Northern Ireland, in particular, due to the withdrawal of the UK from the union.  While I entirely understand the rationale, the fact is that such a proposal would unnecessarily distract from work to secure arrangements which reflect the genuinely unique situation of Northern Ireland, which was founded in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its geographic status as the only border between the UK and 27 EU member states.<\/p> <p> The provisions in the Government motion clearly support and point to the need for specific, effective and realisable measures that could address the major concerns about Brexit.  Whether this relates to the Border, citizenship, constitutional and human rights provisions of the Agreement or otherwise, the Government will also advocate for the continuation of a range of EU policy support for Northern Ireland and the peace process, including EU funding.  It is considering precedence and potential approaches of an innovative nature in this regard. <\/p> <p> There are an array of difficult issues to address.  Perhaps the most difficult and concerning of all is the matter of the Border.  There has been much discussion and speculation about how this could be achieved, but the position of the Government from the very beginning has been that the invisible Border must be maintained.  We are intensively engaged, in order to deepen understanding and support for each of Ireland's headline concerns, with every one of our EU partners, including the United Kingdom, as I have already outlined. <\/p> <p> Over the past eight months, I have engaged intensively throughout the European Union and there is not a Foreign Minister in the European Union who is not aware of the central importance of the Good Friday Agreement and the staunch determination of the Irish Government, its co-guarantor, to make sure its principles and provisions are fully respected in any future arrangement or agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that none of the gains of the peace process are lost.  We have to be clear about the Border and many other areas.  The United Kingdom and the European Union may need to compromise if we are to achieve the demanding objectives that the Government has set.  The preservation of the invisible Border is a shared goal of the Irish and UK Governments.  The Taoiseach set out to Prime Minister Theresa May on 30 January in Dublin the imperative for achieving that.  There will be a need for the British Government to factor into its negotiating position with the European Union the stated objective in regard to our Border.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at a meeting yesterday.  <\/p> <p> The Government will continue to work with our EU partners and prepare comprehensively in support of our overall objectives, including those pertaining to Northern Ireland, the peace process and all-island issues.  It is, therefore, essential that the indispensable work of the North-South Ministerial Council can recommence at the earliest possible opportunity as the EU-UK negotiations are about to start.  <\/p> <p> The re-establishment of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible after the elections on 2 March is critical in managing the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland.  The Executive, as Deputies will be aware, is responsible for politically representing Northern Ireland's interests, including in the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.  Members of the House have a specific responsibility in that regard.<\/p> <p> Our amendment sets out the overall strategy for protecting the gains of the peace process and working in the interests of the island as a whole, underlining the work the Government has undertaken in regard to Northern Ireland in the context of this challenge.  Many of the elements of the motions proposed by both Opposition parties are covered in this ongoing work, but are not listed in the Government motion so as to avoid inadvertent prioritisation of some and possible exclusion of others. <\/p> <p> The avenue we take is that which will ensure that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected in any future EU-UK arrangements.  We will secure the peace process and all-island interests.  This is what the Government will continue to make progress on in the context of these negotiations.  I commend the Government's counter-motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500046#WW00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487176800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I welcome the tabling-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500047#XX00200","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1487176800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Does this qualify as a maiden speech on behalf of Deputy Donnelly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500047#XX00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487176800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>No one should interrupt.

I would also like to acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in's position on accepting our amendment.<\/p><p>In the past two hours, the Taoiseach described Brexit as the most important negotiations in our history.  What is at stake?<\/p><p>It is the following: the close ties between our nations; jobs in Irish companies that trade with the UK, including jobs in manufacturing, tourism, transport, professional services, technology and much more; the livelihoods of farmers and of men and women working in the agrifood sector; and public moneys that are badly needed for investment in public services, health, education and infrastructure.  The people of Northern Ireland face all these threats too, and more.  Their economy, jobs and ability to invest in services and communities are at risk as are their rights, including their right to be members of the European Union and their rights as citizens of the European Union to move, work and do business freely within the EU.<\/p> <p> Yesterday we met a civil society delegation from Northern Ireland.  It is concerned that the deepening deprivation in some communities is leading to a rise in young people joining paramilitary groups and that sectarianism is reappearing in the workplace.  It is concerned that the bill of rights mandated under the Good Friday Agreement is still not being implemented, that the peace process is coming under pressure and that Brexit will make all these things worse.  It would not be fair to say that this Government is doing nothing on Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit.  It would be fair, however, to say that the Government is not doing nearly enough.  This view is in line with that of civil society, which is that the Irish Government has been detached from the Good Friday Agreement for the past six years.  The allegation was made yesterday - it is not my allegation - that this Government is becoming a mouthpiece for the British Government.<\/p> <p> The motion before the House calls for Northern Ireland to be designated a special status within the EU.  We agree with this call and want to further debate what it means.  This Government's response to the challenges and opportunities of Brexit as they pertain to Ireland and Northern Ireland has been too vague.  What does special status actually mean?  What sectors will be worst hit?  What rights of the people of Northern Ireland are at risk?  What sort of invisible Border can actually stop people and goods from moving across it?  What can farmers and businesses actually do to protect their incomes?<\/p> <p> Article 50 will be triggered in a few weeks' time and we have to move from generalities to specifics.  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion accepts the motion before the House and adds detail on what is required.  It calls on the Government to negotiate for the North of Ireland to be designated a special status within the EU; to secure the ongoing realisation of rights of citizens in Northern Ireland to avail of Irish and, by consequence, EU citizenship; to safeguard the four freedoms of movement of goods, workers, capital and services; to protect ongoing access to EU institutions, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights and EU sectoral agreements; and to protect and ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  The motion calls on the Government to maintain future funding streams of PEACE and INTERREG financing; to enter any forthcoming negotiations in co-operation with our EU colleagues recognising the vote of the majority of citizens in Northern Ireland to remain within the EU; and to ensure that the Amsterdam treaty, as it relates to the common travel area between the UK and Ireland, is respected fully and upheld.<\/p> <p> We need to beef up Ireland&rsquo;s current approach to Brexit.  As a matter of urgency, a Minister for Brexit at Cabinet level should be appointed and tasked with leading a whole-of-Government response to the challenge of Brexit.  The \"every Minister is a Brexit Minister\" approach has been the driving force to date behind the vagueness in the Government's approach.<\/p> <p> We need to be absolutely clear that special status for Northern Ireland in the context of the Brexit negotiations is by no means guaranteed.  The UK does not support it, but rather a much weaker recognition of so-called unique circumstances.  The Northern Ireland Secretary of State has specifically stated that he believes a special status would be \"the wrong approach\".  Therefore, the Irish State, together with the Northern Ireland Assembly, must fight for it.  They must fight for the rights of Northern Ireland citizens as EU citizens and the protection of workers rights; for an invisible border that can be implemented in the real world; for the preservation of the common travel area; for the protection and progress of the peace process; for ongoing EU PEACE funding; for the protection and strengthening of trade in agrifood and other industries in the North and South; for the strengthening of sectoral ties between the North and South, including in energy, health, education and transport; for support to the regions in the Republic that will be most affected by Brexit; and, critically, for the protection and ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500047#XX00500","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487177400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I have lived all my life in the constituency of Louth in a community that suffered the fallout from the Troubles yet benefitted greatly from our membership of the EU.  It was only with peace and EU investment that our region came out of the shadow and began to thrive.  That process ensured an invisibility in our Border.  It would be a regressive and retrograde step should any damage be caused to either the fragile peace achieved to date or the economic progress that has accrued to our island as a result of our EU membership and, in particular, in the context of Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made substantial amendments to this Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  However, it is the interests of all the people of this island, North and South, that our main objective is to ensure that we do all that we can to highlight the unique and special circumstances of Northern Ireland and the need for this to be a central tenet in the final Brexit agreement.<\/p><p>However, EU customs and trade lawyers have stated special EU customs rules for the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland are unlikely.  As stated by a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy, a report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>by the political editor, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, states that he can reveal that the Government is preparing for the return of a hard Border in the wake of Brexit, including the return of full red and green channel checkpoints.  It has been revealed that Revenue Commissioner officials have been engaged to examine locations for full Border check points with red and green channel facilities in counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal.<\/p><p>The M1 motorway, which passes through my own constituency, is of considerable focus.  I have seen this myself and witnessed last Monday for the third time the Ml motorway closed going south.  I have seen cars being impounded and checked and I do not believe this to be normal process of various State agencies.  All this is in stark contrast to what the Government has been saying over and over again since the referendum, which is that there would be no return to a hard border.<\/p><p>We are calling for the Government to make the case for and secure a special status for Northern Ireland and to ensure the right of citizens of Northern Ireland to avail of Irish citizenship and, by consequence, EU citizenship is retained.  As stated by Deputy Donnelly, this also applies to the maintaining of PEACE and INTERREG funding, which is crucial both North and South in terms of how we do business and improve our region.  The peace process in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement which underpins it cannot be compromised, including no dilution of human rights.  This has been pivotal in encouraging joint co-operation in our educational institutions, local authorities working collaboratively North and South, peace groups of all persuasions and none, and sporting organisations, to name but a few. <\/p><p>There have been many excellent organisations and initiatives that followed from the Good Friday Agreement, including the Ballyconnell agreement and Co-operation And Working Together, CAWT, which facilitates cross-Border collaborative working in health and social care.  We need to be informed not just at the macro level but, more importantly, about the ramifications at the farm gate and the village store, for educational institutions and on cross-Border health care and on so many other areas that affect our daily lives.  It is for this reason that we need a complete analysis and audit of the various sectors impacts on the sectors right across Government.  Manufacturers will have to consider whether it is still economically feasible to move several times goods for processing, as alluded to earlier, across the Border.  Surely we can agree an all-Ireland brand that will promote the agrisector, North and South, to the wider world and that the EU would recognise this.<\/p><p>It is my belief that non-contentious issues such as tourism promotion on an all-Ireland basis together with ensuring security in our energy requirement should be part of any negotiations.  If the building of it is not lost to our communities, the Narrow Water Bridge would be symbolic and help tourism.  While not wishing to dilute the economic challenges facing this island, I believe that peace and prosperity will drive our economy.<\/p><p>Now, more than ever, we must continue dialogue - north, south, east and west - to ensure our island nation prospers.  The will of the people of Northern Ireland, the majority of whom voted to remain in the European Union, must be reflected in the final agreement.  Imposing the full impact of a hard Brexit on Northern Ireland or this island would be unacceptable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500048#YY00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487178000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank and commend Deputy Gerry Adams and his colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion and accepting the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.  This will add to and strengthen the motion and I ask the Government to reflect and withdraw its amendment because it will not have any effect.  What we have is the D&aacute;il, under the new political arrangement, speaking with one voice.  It is at times such as this that we can reflect on how far we have come since the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>I have not yet had an opportunity, as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, to extend my best wishes to Martin McGuinness on his retirement and wish him a speedy recovery.  I also acknowledge the work that Mr. McGuinness, Deputy Adams and many individuals in the South, including members of my party and all other parties, did to secure the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is our starting point and a red line.  Any dilution of it must be rejected, whether this involves moves by the British Government towards diluting its human rights dimensions or a strengthening of the Border.<\/p><p>If I heard the Minister correctly, he dismissed the argument in favour of special status for the North.  I am disappointed he did so because the North should have special status and the Government indicated previously it would support such an approach.  Unfortunately, because the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, on behalf of the British Government, dismissed special status, the Government has simply followed by stating it cannot secure special status.  It cannot and should not give up that fight.  The passing of an agreed motion on this matter would show that the D&aacute;il speaks with one voice on this issue.  An agreed motion should also become Government policy because the D&aacute;il is elected by citizens in the Republic. <\/p><p>I have spent a great deal of time in the North, especially in the past year, and my party has engaged with groups here.  As my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, stated, we also met representatives of groups yesterday which are looking to Dublin for leadership.  They want the D&aacute;il to advocate and fight for the hundreds of thousands of citizens in the North who have Irish citizenship and ensure their rights as European citizens are protected.  Whether one is born in Dublin or Belfast, Irish citizenship is equal but I do not see the Government or the Minister fighting for that.<\/p><p>The amendment proposes the appointment of a minister for Brexit to co-ordinate work in government on this issue.  This is not in any way to do down the work the Minister is trying to do but when too many people are in charge, no one is in charge.  Too many things are falling through the cracks.  Having a common focus through a Brexit ministry and recognising, as a Government, that the North should have special status in the European Union would be a starting point.  I am greatly concerned that the Taoiseach is having bilateral meetings without insisting, as a starting point, that the North have special status.  We need to do much more in this regard. <\/p><p>The passing of the Good Friday Agreement, the ending of terrorism and the Troubles and the normalisation of relations between Britain and Ireland showed what was possible on the island of Ireland.  The British exit from the European Union is the biggest single threat and the Brexit negotiations the most important negotiations we have faced since the Agreement was signed.  The Government must realise that this issue is of crucial importance for Ireland and the future of Europe.  Let us be selfish for a change and try to look after Ireland.  <\/p><p>In the past five or six years, I have consistently stated that the approach taken by this Government and its predecessor to the all-Ireland bodies established under the Good Friday Government and the British Government has been worse than<i>laissez-faire<\/i>.  We have not used these mechanisms to their full potential.  We now have an opportunity to redouble our efforts and ensure the institutions the people of Ireland, in all 32 counties, voted for in 1998 are used to their full potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487178000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Ireland is the member state of the European Union most affected by the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016.  Our concerns centre on the possible erection of barriers to trade, the creation of a hard Border, the maintenance of the common travel area and the viability of the Northern Ireland peace process.  Trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom is valued at &euro;1.2 billion per week and it is estimated that 14,000 people cross the Border every day.  It is concern for the future of the Northern Ireland peace process that is exercising all our minds.  The political stability and prosperity of Northern Ireland is not at risk.  As Deputies noted, the Good Friday Agreement is of central importance.<\/p>  <p>  Northern Ireland citizens have a right to European Union citizenship as a result of their right to Irish citizenship, as provided for in the Constitution and Good Friday Agreement.  The European Convention of Human Rights, through the Good Friday Agreement, is fundamental law in Northern Ireland and the courts must be able to enforce European human rights law in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of national identity has come to the fore again arising from the decision on Brexit, which is a major problem.  There is a strong fear that the Border could become politicised.  We do not want to return to previous times.  As my colleagues noted, the PEACE and INTERREG programmes, which have played an important role in the peace process, must be maintained.  This means that irrespective of what price the British pay as part of their divorce proceedings, the commitments given to these programmes must be fulfilled and maintained. <\/p>  <p>  A delegation of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs visited the European institutions recently.  During the visit, we met Commissioner Phil Hogan, Mr. Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator for the European Commission, and Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, MEP, the European Parliament's representative on Brexit, among many others.  In my view, there is now a full appreciation and understanding of the Irish position among key personnel in the European Union.  There is also considerable concern about the future of the Northern Ireland peace process, in which the European Union played an important part.  While the threats to the peace process are understood, it was made clear to me that Ireland must be much more proactive in preparing its solutions to our unique problems.  The message I received was that Europe is open to solutions.  I hope work is under way in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Many groups and organisations are identifying the problems and proposing possible solutions.  I note, in particular, the work of the Institute of International and European Affairs, which has produced various papers proposing practical solutions for discussion.  Our problems need to be dealt with first and up-front once Article 50 has been triggered and we need to have our issues and concerns included in any initial draft papers prepared by the Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland must negotiate for the North to be designated as a special status region within the European Union.  We must drill down into this concept to produce specific measures on the movement of people and conduct of trade.  As regards trade between North and South and the Republic and United Kingdom in general, we need to argue for state aid rules to be eased for a transitory period and a special fund to be established to allow for the development of replacement and diversification.  We must also utilise the European Investment Bank to develop our ports to improve connectivity as we deal with this major issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1487178000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>This week, we have a Government in crisis while the United Kingdom is only weeks away from triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.  It does not bode well for Ireland that collective responsibility in our Government has broken down just a the country faces a challenge that will define it for decades to come.  For the past few months, the D&aacute;il has been left in the dark on Brexit, despite the Taoiseach having appointed himself the actual minister for Brexit.<\/p><p>Months ago, I requested, and the Taoiseach agreed, that we be provided with weekly updates in this House on all that was happening in regard to this matter but that has not happened.  I received my first briefing from officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, comprehensibly on our state of preparedness, yesterday.  While the briefing was offered last week I was unable to take up the offer until this week.  We need to improve in this area.  While there are questions that need to be asked in terms of our state of readiness, arguably the state of readiness of Northern Ireland is infinitely worse.  It has been plunged into an Assembly election.  The relationship between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in has become politically toxic in the context of that election.<\/p> <p> That this motion has been tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in at this time is interesting.  The people of Northern Ireland voted to remain part of the European Union.  The largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in, failed to register for the Brexit campaign with the United Kingdom Electoral Commission.  According to Mick Fealty registering with the Electoral Commission allows a party or an individual to become a registered campaigner and to spend more than &pound;10,000 on referendum campaigning during the election period.  That the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland decided it did not want to spend more than &pound;10,000 on the campaign indicates that it did not take the campaign seriously.

Every political entity, including all the tiny parties all over the United Kingdom, registered because they wanted to spend more than &pound;10,000 on their campaigns because this was such an important issue.  It is remarkable that Sinn F&eacute;in did not do that.  Registration not only allowed parties to spend money, it allowed them access to polling stations and so on.<\/p><p>The Labour Party supports the SDLP's call for a bespoke deal for Northern Ireland to address the following issues post-Brexit: strengthening of existing all-island institutions; continued cross-Border co-operation; guarantees of funding for Northern Ireland beyond 2020; recognition of the rights of the 200,000 persons resident on the island who are neither Irish nor British citizens; and the need for parity of esteem in human rights across the island of Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, has also called for the creation of a separate component or strand within Brexit talks to deal exclusively with Ireland-UK matters.  That is an idea worthy of consideration, particularly given that the European Commission and Council appear to have already established an impenetrable structure for its negotiations, the detail of which I tortuously tried to grasp yesterday.<\/p><p>Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned that the impact on Ireland may become collateral damage to a wider EU row with the UK.  What we are hearing in terms of some of the rhetoric being uttered is that Ireland, sitting in the middle ground, may become squeezed between the hardline Brexiteers and the arch Federalists.  In terms of this motion, Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking special status within the European Union for Northern Ireland.  That is a position I support but it will realistically be very difficult to achieve when the reality is that the largest political party in Northern Ireland is happy to leave the EU.  Critically, while there is a precedent in Greenland for an autonomous region to leave the European Union while the parent state remains, there is no precedent for a state to leave and one of its regions to remain within the EU.  The EU works on the basis of state rather than regional membership, at least so far.  <\/p><p>The report by Mr. Daniel McConnell in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>that the Government is examining locations for customs checkpoints is a portent of what might await us.  A border might well be back in some shape or form despite the assurances of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Outside of a fast-tracked united Ireland that may be the reality.  Whatever status we arrive at, it is the turmoil that exit will create that is the real challenge for our politics and public policy.  As a Westminster committee was recently told, &quot;In future you will not be able to walk your dog on Slieve Russell unless you have a passport for the dog.&quot;  In truth, the range of questions that Brexit has placed before us demand detailed and forensic answers.<\/p><p>I have previously given one example of the complex situation we are facing, namely, the North-South interconnector and the common energy market.  I choose this issue not because it is the most serious issue, because there are many more, but instead of grappling with the complexities of these issues and seeking to chart national responses to them the Government believes that a nationwide roadshow and repeat of the same slogans again and again will suffice.  We need to have very public engagement on all the forensic work that is happening within Departments on all the issues, including tourism, energy policy, agriculture, industry, aviation, shipping and transport.  If the picture were not alarming enough already the evidence of the former head of the European Commission customs procedures to MPs two weeks ago was further reason to sit up and take note.  At that time he bluntly stated that if Northern Ireland is not part of the European Union customs territory then there will be a customs border.  Of even more concern is that the ESRI has found that Ireland would lose 4% of total exports under a hard Brexit outcome.  Some 4% is huge.  It would hit most in the job intensive sectors such as agrifood and tourism.  Some 4% of our exports in 2015 amounted to &euro;4.5 billion.  As Ireland's recovery takes hold and our people start to feel some sense that there is a future for this country after the lost decade, Brexit could not come at a worse time.  For this reason, we have argued for advance planning on the European side and for the expansion of tools such as the European Globalisation Fund.  I again ask the Minister to lay out in forensic detail the plans that this country is making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500050#AAA00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487178600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith who is sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500050#AAA00600","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1487178600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I welcome this discussion on Brexit and, in particular, Brexit in the context of Northern Ireland.  I do not believe we talk enough in this House about Northern Ireland.  I am delighted that we are doing so tonight.  However, when I read this Sinn F&eacute;in motion I recognise neither the European Union nor Northern Ireland.  I certainly do not recognise Sinn F&eacute;in in it.  Liadh N&iacute; Riada, a Sinn F&eacute;in MEP, on joining the left group in the European Union, said in her statement that the reason she joined that group was because the economic and fiscal policies of the European Union are having a catastrophic affect on the lives of all our citizens.  She also said in that statement that: \"The gap between the rich and poor in the EU is constantly increasing, social rights are being dismantled, unemployment (especially youth unemployment) remains at high levels and the people of the member states are being subordinated to poverty and stagnation.\"  That is the Sinn F&eacute;in I recognise.  It is the EU I recognise.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union's neoliberal and austerity policies and its fortress Europe policies have imposed an undemocratic Union which fails to do what it set out to do, which was to provide equality, jobs and security for the people of Europe after the World Wars but it does the opposite.  It is currently promoting an arms industry and developing a military apparatus to compete with the rest of the world.  There is good reason for the view that Europe does not serve the people of this island or Northern Ireland well.  What is required is a real look at Northern Ireland.  Rather than it being a place where women, workers and students have rights, three women were recently arrested in Northern Ireland for taking the abortion pill.  Women in Northern Ireland are worse off than women in the South in terms of there being no abortion facilities in Northern Ireland.  It is one of the most unequal places in Europe to live, with a high level of deprivation yet it has 14,000 millionaires, with 45% of households having no savings.<\/p><p> In the Northern Ireland Assembly, both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have been pushing for the Fresh Start agreement.  That agreement will result in a loss of 20,000 public sector jobs, welfare reform in the \"I, Daniel Blake\" style, privatisation of public property resources and services, and a lowering of the rate of corporation tax.  These are the realities of both Europe and Northern Ireland.  We want instead to amend the motion so it will state we will not accept a hard Border after Brexit and that the people of the North and South do not want it.  We will defy the European Union or Britain if either attempts to impose such a border.  That really means developing a model of people power for this country resulting in action being taken to defy those powers that would impose a hard border and to have people dismantle any hard border they attempt to impose on us.<\/p> <p> We will be calling on the Northern Ireland Executive to refuse to lower corporation tax and to have an open debate on the kind of public model we need to create a green economy.  By that, I do not mean a nationalist economy but an environmentally friendly economy for the people that puts people before profit.  In the words of James Connolly, who said we serve neither King nor Kaiser, we would like to see the people of this island openly saying they serve neither London nor Brussels because neither acts in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland or the South.  We look forward to a change in this country and I am much more hopeful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500050#AAA00700","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487179200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The scope of this debate needs to be broadened somewhat so the nature of the European Union, which is consistently referenced in a positive light in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, is discussed.  After all, the campaign Sinn F&eacute;in waged for a \"remain\" vote in the North was clearly a factor in producing the different result there by comparison with England and Wales.  It is ironic that Sinn F&eacute;in campaigned to remain in the first instance and talked up the role of the European Union at a time when the deeply undemocratic anti-worker and anti-migrant nature of that institution had become more apparent than ever.  It is on this basis that the political tradition to which I belong opposed the entry of Ireland, North and South, into the Common Market and opposed all treaties since then that have furthered the pro-capitalist and anti-worker nature of the European Union.  It was presumably for those reasons that Sinn F&eacute;in adopted a similar position right up until the Brexit referendum.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission and European Central Bank, as two component parts of the troika, foisted a brutal diet of austerity on working class people in the South in addition to Greece and Portugal.  Successive treaties have effectively written neoliberalism into law.  The policies of Fortress Europe, which have contributed to the death of thousands in the Mediterranean, in a sense leave Mr. Donald Trump and the border wall he dreams about in the ha'penny place.<\/p>  <p>  The word \"Brexit\" has become synonymous with the right-wing arguments that were made by UKIP, the DUP and a wing of the Tory party in favour of leaving the Union.  Contrary to the dominant view of the UK capitalist class and a host of pro-establishment organisations, from NATO to the IMF, this minority within the political and economic establishment, for its own reasons which I do not have time to go into here, felt that UK business interests would be better served outside the European Union.  They tapped into a pre-existing anti-establishment mood and used xenophobic arguments to further their aim.  However, from a completely different perspective, there was and is a left-wing case against the European Union consistent with the arguments some of us have made for the past 45 years.  The case for a left exit, or \"Lexit\", was made in Britain and Northern Ireland not just by the radical left but also by the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, the largest public sector union in the North, and also the likes of the trade union RMT.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific concerns raised in the motion, the Anti Austerity Alliance stands for the maximum freedom of movement of people internationally and therefore opposes any kind of hard border between the North and South.  Furthermore, it opposes the threats that are posed to the status of EU nationals living in the North and Britain and, likewise, the talk of retaliatory measures being taken against people in the North and Britain living in continental Europe.  In so far as the Tories see Brexit as an opportunity for an offensive against the social and economic rights of workers, these possibilities have to be combatted by industrial and campaigning means by workers in the North and Britain rather than by appeals to this Government to negotiate a dispensation with the Tories.<\/p>  <p>  A left Government here that sought to introduce the necessary measures to raise revenue through a steeply progressive taxation regime and then investment in housing, health and jobs would find itself on a collision course with the European Union and its fiscal rules, just as Syriza did until its capitulation in Greece.  The course pursued by Sinn F&eacute;in in not arguing for a Lexit in the North indicates that if it achieved a place in government in the South, it would not fundamentally differ from the current Government or its Fianna F&aacute;il-led predecessor in managing the system for the 1%, the richest, the minority at the top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500051#BBB00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1487179200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion.  It is agreed throughout the whole island that Northern Ireland deserves special status.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing this motion forward.  When I was a young lad growing up, we saw troubles in the North on television, and people were actually afraid to cross the Border at one stage.  In fairness, the work of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Unionists and other parties involved, but mainly the first two, must be commended for bringing peace to the North and a new way of life to many people.  Irrespective of what needs to be done and the consequences of Brexit, we need to keep up this momentum.  Irrespective of whatever effort must be made by the South and Britain, or America or whatever other parties got involved in the peace process, we need to ensure the path the people in the North are now on is protected.  It is great to see that anybody can go to any part of the North at present without fear.<\/p>  <p>  In the South, we are delusional if we do not stand up and tell the people the current scenarios.  We are like substitutes on a substitutes' bench looking out at two teams playing but, unfortunately, none of the two teams seems to be ours.  Europe will be trying to do the best deal it can for itself and the Brits will be trying to do whatever they can for themselves.  We are going to be like piggy in the middle if we do not tell people what is occurring straight out.  We must be honest and say that there is a serious possibility of a hard border.  People talk about our friends but in 2009 we saw the way this country got crucified by Europe.  We saw what happened with the promissory note.  We saw it would be Frankfurt's way or Dublin's way.  We saw a deal breaker but, unfortunately, it was not in the interest of the people in this country.  It would be naive and foolish of us to build up something that may not be attained.  From what I can see at present, a hard border will exist and we would be as well to try to resolve that issue.  I hear people saying X number of people voted one way or another in the Brexit referendum.  I voted against the Lisbon treaty twice in referendums but ultimately I had to accept the result of the vote.  As with the British vote, which has resulted in the British deciding to leave the European Union, one must respect whatever democracy does.  If we do not start respecting democracy, just as we question undemocratic practices in all parts of the world, we will be in trouble ourselves.  We are currently talking about bringing power to Northern Ireland.  There are many ties between England and Ireland.  The Government talks about different Departments, Brexit Ministers and all the different ways we should be approaching this matter.<\/p><p>However, when I look at the D&aacute;il, I often wonder whether the people here ever tried to do a deal at a fair in a small town years ago.  We need to set out our stall.  We need to say exactly what we require.  Let us not cod ourselves.  We are going around Europe and talking to various people, but they are not really concerned about us.  They do not mind how Ireland gets on.  Their business is to represent themselves in their countries, not to think about us.  That is how they will approach this regardless of whether we like it.<\/p> <p> A debate has to start.  Plan A seems to be that we will look on from the dugout, see how Mr. Barnier and the British get on and sit with our hands in our pockets.  What if doomsday happens and things go wrong?  What will we do if tariffs are placed on Irish agricultural products?  Will we wake up and start running around trying to find different markets?  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who said that we needed to tell Europe where to go, but it does not listen to people who tell it to do that.  Instead, it tries to penalise people monetarily.  That is Europe's way of hammering people down.<\/p> <p> At the moment, everyone is on the road with plan A.  We are hearing in every town hall and so on that Ireland is doing X, Y and Z.  If it does not happen, however, we will need plan B.  The debate needs to start on Ireland being a part of the EFTA or the like so that we can still trade with Britain and the EU.  If we cannot trade with Britain, the loss will be too much.  Let us be realistic - we will not pick up markets in other parts of the world overnight that will compensate for the loss to our agricultural sector.  From what I have heard, Europe wants to give Britain a slap like a bold child in a class so that no one else will leave.  Yes, it costs money to be in the EFTA and we would have no say in the EU, but we do not have much of a say at the moment.  We are walked on in every way.  If we do not do something, our economy will suffer a ferocious crash.  Ireland cannot afford that, given what we have come through.<\/p> <p> We need to lay out our stall and tell Europe what we want.  In fairness, I do not see Britain having a problem with that.  It has stated that it does not want a Border or tariffs, but the bureaucrats in Europe tell us that we must have X, Y and Z.  We must start that debate and think of ourselves for once, not be the great buddies of Europe.  Instead of patting people on the back and smiling at them, we would want to be giving them an odd dig in the ribs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500051#BBB00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487179800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Quite right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500052#CCC00200","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1487179800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Only in the ribs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500052#CCC00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1487179800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The next spearkers are Deputies Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Danny Healy-Rae, who are sharing eight minutes.

Last week, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs went to Brussels where we had 14 meetings over a two-day period.

In the past, Mr. Barnier visited the North and met leading members of Sinn F&eacute;in and people from all the various sectors.  He has a great grasp of what exists between Northern Ireland and the South.  He knows the peace process intimately.  He knows how important it is for us not to have a hard border.  Having spoken to him, I am more confident that his finger is on the pulse and that he knows how important it is to us that we get through this.  Otherwise, Ireland will be adversely affected, which none of us wants.  Since we are in a unique situation, we must negotiate, we need political leadership and we all must work off of the same page.  Having had those meetings, I am more confident that we are at least dealing with negotiators who know the situation on the ground.  I welcome this debate and thank Sinn F&eacute;in for initiating it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500052#CCC00700","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1487179800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I appreciate being able to speak on this matter.  We have known for long enough that there will be a Brexit, but not enough is being done about it.  With so many distractions, sideshows and so on, less and less is being done about it.  While I appreciate Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's comments about visiting Europe - I am also on the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs - the majority of the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain.  However, they are unfortunately not a part of Ireland at the moment.  I wish that they were and we all aspire to a Thirty-two County Republic, but we are where we are and the situation is grim.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot have a hard border.  In early September, I travelled from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia via a motorway that had only recently been built.  I saw tailbacks and the 52 people on the bus had to give over their passports for checking.  Unfortunately, little sweeteners had to be given to the officials on the road to avoid everyone having to be taken off the bus and checked.  We did not give them, but that is the system over there.  We cannot have that.<\/p>  <p>  I was young enough when I went to Northern Ireland ag lorg mn&aacute;.  Fuair m&eacute; bean go h&aacute;lainn anseo freisin.

It was an appalling vista, with tailbacks and people being taken out of their cars and searched by the UDR, customs and God knows what on both sides of the Border.  We cannot go back to that.  It would set us back 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment everyone involved in the peace process, including my former colleague and former Senator, Deputy and Minster of State, Dr. Martin Mansergh, who played a major role, Fr. Alec Reid and many other people.  We need those kinds of people again and massive engagement.  We need envoys.  It is not business as usual in Europe because the people in Europe have not been good to us.  We have had many experiences of that, for example, the banking crisis and our fisheries.  The big powers in Europe have not wanted to engage or have not given a damn about us.  We saw how hard-nosed they were when Brexit happened.  They just wanted to annihilate everybody else.<\/p>  <p>  We have to fight our own corner.  We have to ensure that this island and our exports are protected.  We have to ensure that our farming industry and jobs are protected.  Above all, we must ensure a sense of justice and respect for the people of Northern Ireland.  I compliment the Deputies who moved this motion and the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which I believe is being accepted, but we need action, not words.  We need to talk strongly.  It is time to call on our European colleagues to stand up and look after us in Ireland, North and South.

As a Deputy representing rural Ireland that is why I am asking the Government to pull out all the stops and talk with the politicians in Europe.

As we all know, the majority of citizens in the North, 56%, voted to remain in the EU in the recent referendum.  Their wish must be upheld and respected.  Those citizens voted to remain because it is in their best interests politically and economically.  As the fallout from the Brexit referendum continues, the only thing that is becoming clear is that there is no plan to protect the interests of Ireland, North and South.  It is also quite obvious that the British Government is on a collision course with the EU, in which our economy and successive peace agreements are regarded as collateral damage.  To drag the people of the North out of the EU against the express wishes of the majority of its people fundamentally undermines democracy and the principle of consent, which has become the bulwark of political relations in the North and is the foundation of the peace process.<\/p>  <p>  Economically, the prospect of the return of a hard Border on this island will have hugely negative impacts for SMEs, investors, farmers, the agrifood sector and, of course, on ordinary citizens North and South who will be forced to bear the brunt of the impact.  In education, for example, stakeholders have raised significant concerns about the impact of Brexit in areas such as cross-Border funding for educational programmes and initiatives, the institutional framework for North-South co-operation, the impact on teacher flow and supply and the mutual recognition of qualifications.  Those important issues were raised at a recent meeting on Brexit with representatives of the Department of Education and Skills.  In the higher education sector serious concerns have been raised about the impact of Brexit in terms of attracting EU funding for research and innovation, as well as the issue of student flows North and South and the lack of certainty on future student funding.<\/p>  <p>  Research collaboration between Irish and British and Northern Irish research teams on EU-funded projects has been extensive and mutually beneficial, with 892 collaborative links in successful projects under Horizon 2020.  The retention of those collaborative links is crucial to Ireland's ability to attract research funding and develop the expertise that allows us to compete on the international stage in terms of attracting international students and future investment.  The designation of special status for the North within the EU is the only credible means by which we can minimise the negative fallout from Brexit.  The achievement of special status would allow for the retention of EU funding streams and would protect the common travel area and allow North-South co-operation and collaboration to continue unhindered.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has, on previous occasions, shown itself to be pragmatic and flexible in coming forward with arrangements in dealing with complex situations.  Sinn F&eacute;in has already commenced a diplomatic offensive on this issue.  Both Martin McGuinness and Michelle O'Neill have been in touch with the various Heads of State to outline the need for special status and our Oireachtas team has been meeting with relevant ambassadors.  We need the Government to do the same.  There is no excuse not to do so.  We need a united approach on this issue and we need to speak with one voice North and South to defend the interests of our country and our people, all 32 counties, not just the interests of those in the Twenty-six county partitionist state.

The British Government has made it clear that it will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March 2017 and begin the exit process, and it will also seek to leave the Single Market in what can only be called a hard Brexit.  This situation is unprecedented, as no member state has left the European Union and the Single Market before now.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has been continuously saying that a North of Ireland exit from the European Union would harden the divisions between North and South on this island, with the potential for the re-introduction of customs checkpoints, trading tariffs and adverse knock-on effects for all-island economic activity and co-operation.  That would re-affirm and harden the Border and could be the most intense development on the Border landscape since partition and certainly since the demilitarisation of the Border since the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The Government has continuously assured us that it would do its utmost to avoid any return to a hard Border.  However, it is frightening to learn that under Government plans to deal with Brexit, it has begun identifying location points for full customs checkpoints along the Border with the Six Counties.  According to reports in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, internal documents show that the Government is preparing for the return of a hard Border in the wake of Brexit, including the return of full red and green channel checkpoints.  Cited in the same publication was a quote from a Minister, whomever that might be, who said &quot;No one is aiming for a soft Brexit anymore, it is now about preparing for the worst&quot;.

For example, who is involved in this effort to identity the location for Border controls?<\/p><p>How long have they being doing it?  When are they due to report back?  To whom will they report?

These are the questions that ordinary folk living in the Border counties are discussing and are anxious about.  <\/p> <p> There is a way of avoiding all of this.  A total of 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.  The democratic will of the people must be respected.  The only credible approach is for Northern Ireland to be designated with special status within the EU and thereby for the whole island of Ireland to remain within the EU.  As part of the Brexit negotiations, it is essential to argue the case for designated special status for Northern Ireland within the Union.  I therefore call on all Deputies to support this motion which calls on Government to enter any forthcoming negotiations to defend the democratic mandate of the people of the Six Counties to remain within the EU and to act in Ireland's national interest.   The Government should also report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on at least a quarterly basis regarding developments in the Brexit negotiations.

We had a very constructive meeting of the Committee on European Union Affairs today.  Again, representatives from Fianna F&aacute;il were there.  Deputies Haughey and Crowe were present.  To date, we have demonstrated two characteristics regarding how we engage with these negotiations.  The first has been the strong level of consensus among parties here in the D&aacute;il while the second has been a very strong consensus about the absolute importance the Government and people attach to the issues and challenges that will be faced by our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland.  I have had very good engagement with M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, Deputy Crowe and members of Fianna F&aacute;il and other groups.

It is true to say that the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU, as did the people of Scotland and people in London, but the UK did not.  We must come up with a framework to deal with the new reality we have, a reality we did not want which will see a part of this island experience extreme difficulty as we will experience it ourselves through a decision taken by the UK.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs chaired by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae held meetings in Brussels last week and saw some of the work we have been doing.  <\/p>  <p>  I will touch briefly on an issue that has been raised today particularly strongly by Fianna F&aacute;il, namely, the argument for a Brexit Minister.  As we move into the negotiations, they will be broken into sectors and modules.  For example, Council formations dealing with issues relating to agriculture and transport could take place in different cities and countries with some to be held in Brussels and some in Luxembourg.  Only one country has a Brexit minister and that is the country that is leaving the EU, which is the UK.  We believe that the Department that should lead these discussion is the Department of the Taoiseach because it will be the European Council that will make the decisions.  The preparation for those decisions will be made, as always happens in Europe, in different pieces and sections.  Our permanent representative office or embassy in Brussels is already divided into the sectors of discussion that will take place.  <\/p>  <p>  I compliment the members of the Committee on European Union Affairs and restate that regardless of whether it is through the European United Left-Nordic Green Left group, of which Sinn F&eacute;in is a member; the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, of which Fianna F&aacute;il is a member; the socialists or other groups, politics in Europe works differently to the way it works here.  Every political party will have a very strong role in delivering.  As I said at the outset, we do not find much disagreement about our message apart from the real world difficulty with which we must deal concerning the Good Friday Agreement and the fact that while a significant number of people in Northern Ireland did vote to remain in the EU, there is no indication that they would vote to achieve what we would like to achieve, which is a united Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500054#EEE00200","speaker":"1282"},{"type":"speech","time":1487181000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I extend my thanks for the invitation to attend the Fianna F&aacute;il Brexit summit in County Louth.

There is cross-party consensus in the committee that there will consequences for the island, not only economically but also politically, what with all of the issues around the uncertainty of the Border.  Initially, we heard from both Governments that there could be absolutely no return to a hard Border, but as of yet we have not heard what is the alternative.  There appears to be no urgency on this Government's part through its negotiations with the British Government to seek special status for the North or to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the British Government's White Paper on Brexit last month, the establishment of a Border between the North and South once Britain leaves the EU in 2019 has become much more of a reality.  It is stated that its aim is to have as seamless and frictionless a Border as possible between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  This indicates that it does consider that there will be a Border of some description.  We also know that Britain could be in breach of its international obligations under the Good Friday Agreement if it presses ahead with plans to pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights.  There is a clear obligation on both Governments to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into law in both the Twenty-six Counties and Six Counties.  Therefore, should the Human Rights Act be scrapped, the move would place Britain in breach of its international obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  A recent European Parliament report warned that the British Government's Brexit agenda could require the Good Friday Agreement to be altered.  It claims that the impact of Brexit will be political, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement, which is an international agreement, will require alteration.  This is because of the uncertainty around the Border and what exactly its return will look like.  It states that the re-establishment of a hard Border between the North and the South could provoke a reversal of improvements in cross-Border trade.  That is not news to any of us.  It is one of our greatest fears for Brexit.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have argued at a local, national and European level for special designated status to ensure that the North remains in the EU.

What will happen when we can no longer act as a critical mass for services such as the congenital heart network?  What will happen when patients are no longer able to cross the Border to access services under the cross-Border directive?  What will happen when emergency ambulatory transfers from across the Border are impinged?  Services will be restricted and lives could be lost.  In recent weeks, the Irish people were shocked and horrified but were also seeing familiar scenes in terms of chronic waiting lists.  What will happen with the discontinuation of the entitlement to source treatment in the North and Britain in certain circumstances in which there are delays in having the treatment concerned offered in Ireland where the cost is met by the HSE?  Currently, there are soundings being made about the possibility of the entitlement being replaced by a bilateral agreement that would offer a similar level of entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has also been made to the option of what is known as the S2 route, but that assumes that Britain will become a member of the European Economic Area.  Ultimately, entitlements using the S2 route are more restrictive and less favourable than those covered by the cross-Border health care directive.  In response to parliamentary questions I submitted last year, the HSE revealed that in the 18 months to 30 June 2016, it reimbursed &euro;659,245.09 - just to be accurate - for treatments and services in the North under the cross-Border health care directive.  This represented 277 people travelling for vital health care.  Brexit poses an enormous threat and a further inconvenience to those patients accessing services for which long waiting lists exist - orthopaedics and orthodontics being the most common.  If the cross-Border directive is no longer applicable to the North post-Brexit, it will create an even greater vacuum in the delivery of health services and put even more pressure on our over-burdened health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500055#FFF00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1487181600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in's support of a vote for Britain to remain in the EU was not an endorsement of how the EU is currently structured or of how it operates.  We are quite clearly critical of the EU and spend a lot of time inside and outside of this House, as people know, criticising it and the way in which it operates.  However, placing an external border is not a solution.  Popular protests at customs posts, as suggested by one of the amendments tonight, will not solve any of the problems that the Border counties and the people living along the Border clearly face.<\/p>  <p>  I thank everyone who contributed to the debate this evening.  I believe the contributions reflected the concern we all have for Brexit.  It is important that we unite on this issue because it is of critical importance to Ireland at its people.  Ireland's national interests must be defended.  That has been the message that most of the speakers have articulated tonight.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government's pursuit of a hard Brexit may well impose an amendment to the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which gives legislative authority to the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe this is unacceptable to everyone in this House.  The Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of citizens across the island of Ireland as well as the Irish and British Governments, which are the co-guarantors responsible for safeguarding its integrity.  It is not the unilateral right of any British Government to interfere with this democratically agreed Agreement nor can any British Government overrule the democratically expressed wishes of the people in the North to remain within the EU.<\/p><p>That is the reason this motion is so important.  The Irish Government must fulfil its moral and legal duty to stand up for the rights of all citizens, including those in the North.  We cannot allow the British Government's withdrawal from the European Union to undermine the protections and safeguards or the principle of consent enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  A hard Brexit means a hard border on the island of Ireland, and that must be avoided at all costs.<\/p> <p> We believe there is a particular onus on the Irish Government to take a stand in the forthcoming negotiations with other European Union member states.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to secure the natural position of the whole of Ireland within the EU by designating special status to the North within the European Union.  The democratic mandate of the people of the North to remain within the EU must be respected through designated special status which can secure the position of the entire island of Ireland within the European Union.  As a party, Sinn F&eacute;in has been on a diplomatic offensive.  Like many others, I have been in regular meetings with ambassadors of the EU member states in Dublin briefing them on the need for the North to be given that special status within the EU.<\/p> <p> Like other speakers, I, too, was on the recent trip to Brussels where we met with Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator for the Commission, and Guy Verhofstadt, the MEP who is the European Parliament representative in those negotiations.  In all the meetings we had there was a broad understanding that Ireland was in a unique position regarding Brexit and I believe there was a willingness to examine this island's complex territorial issue.  We know there is huge goodwill towards Ireland but that must be turned into positive action.  The EU has shown its flexibility in complex territorial disputes in the past.  As a priority, therefore, the Government must negotiate on the basis of ensuring that the North gets special status within the EU.  The motion before the House tonight calls on it to do just that.  I welcome that this will be passed and I thank all those who indicated that they will support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500055#FFF00400","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487182200,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation with regard to time-keeping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500056#GGG00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487182200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1487182200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500056#GGG00400","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1487182200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 16 February 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500056#GGG00500","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1487182200,"counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500056#GGG00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1487182200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the Revised Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2017: Votes 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500056#GGG00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Confidence in Government: Motion","time":1487182500,"counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500057#HHH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487182500,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.<\/blockquote><p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to report to the House on the important work being undertaken by the Government, the major challenges that face the country and how the Government intends to meet these challenges.

Sinn F&eacute;in's motion was prompted, we are told, by the Government's decision to establish a commission of investigation into very serious allegations centred on an alleged smear campaign against a serving garda.  When one reflects on the history of that party's relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the years and its shameful handling of sexual abuse claims in its own movement, it has a brass neck to call for a general election on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it clear to the House that the Government's sole objective in responding to the recent protracted disclosures has been and remains to get to the full truth of all these allegations.  The false allegations against Sergeant Maurice McCabe are simply appalling.  Sexual abuse is the worst crime a person could be accused of.  He and his family deserve the truth, as do all against whom allegations have been made.  I, therefore, offer a full apology to Maurice McCabe and his family for the treatment meted out to them as exposed in recent programmes.  This must be done in finding the truth in a way that is transparent to the public but also fair to all concerned.  The Government has decided that a full tribunal of inquiry is the only way it can be achieved.  Intensive work is under way on the terms of reference and I hope the House will support the proposal so the work of the inquiry can commence without delay.<\/p>  <p>  I reject any suggestion the Government has not supported Garda whistleblowers.  I remind the House the Government ensured all Sergeant McCabe's previous allegations were investigated.  They included the reports on the penalty points which were published and the Guerin report into policing issues in Cavan and Monaghan which led in turn to the O'Higgins commission of investigation.  I am pleased in each of these instances the inquiries largely vindicated Sergeant McCabe concerns and his complains.  It includes the recent inquiry by Mr. Justice O'Neill into the allegations of a smear campaign arising from two protected disclosures.  Last week, we proposed a further commission of investigation, chaired by Mr. Justice Charlton of the Supreme Court, accepting the terms of reference drawn up by Mr. Justice O'Neill.  Now that will be transformed into a full tribunal of inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  The issues raised by Sergeant McCabe and others also led to significant reforms by the Government, including the establishment of an independent police authority for the first time in the history of the State.  We legislated for the protection of whistleblowers and empowered GSOC to receive complaints from serving garda&iacute;.  In response to proposals from the Independent Alliance group, we have agreed to appoint without delay an independent international policing expert to carry out a thorough investigation into the wider and more fundamental issues of public concern which have emerged relating to the administration, ethos and culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and this work will augment the ongoing issues by the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the long-term commitment of Independent Alliance colleagues acting in the interests of the McCabe family and the cause of whistleblowers.  Their charter for change states unequivocally that Garda whistleblowers have been treated shamefully and a complete overhaul of the justice system is necessary.  I hope the work of the tribunal of inquiry will also contribute to the ongoing process of policing reform, which is absolutely necessary in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much comment on my brief contact with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  I have corrected the public record in this regard.  On 24 January, one of the Minister's officials told my office she intended to meet Sergeant McCabe.  That was relayed to me.  On 7 February, in a brief informal conversation as the Cabinet meeting of that day was about to commence, the Minister mentioned she had met Sergeant McCabe about false allegations of sexual abuse that had been made to Tusla about him.  She did not go into the details of her meeting with Sergeant and Mrs. McCabe or into Tusla's gross mishandling of the issue.  She quite rightly respected his right to privacy and confidentiality regarding very sensitive matters.<\/p>  <p>  It was absolutely clear to me these allegations would be fully covered by Mr. Justice O'Neill's draft terms of reference as allegations of criminal misconduct against Sergeant McCabe, as these are at the very core of the proposed commission's remit.  In fact, it was Mr. Justice O'Neill who carried out a thorough examination of the two protected disclosures and prepared his draft terms on the basis of covering all the issues he believed needed to be investigated.  This was later confirmed by Mr. Justice Peter Charlton, who stated all the allegations revealed in the \"Prime Time\" programme are, in fact, covered by the original draft terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge I was mistaken in my account of the sequence of contacts with the Minister, Deputy Zappone.  This was an unintentional error for which I have already apologised to the House.  However, I will not and do not apologise for my record as Taoiseach when it comes to child protection.  I appointed the first Cabinet-level Minister with responsibility for children in the history of the State.  In responding to the Cloyne report I expressed the revulsion felt by very many people at the gross failure of the Catholic Church to protect children and punish abusers.  I ensured a referendum was held to enshrine the rights of our children in our Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and that the Children First guidelines were put on a statutory footing.  There is much more work to be done and many more challenges to be met.<\/p>  <p>  An election is the last thing the country needs less than a year after the last one.  At a time of huge international uncertainty we need stability.  In a few short weeks the formal negotiations on Brexit will begin.  Ireland is well prepared for this process but we need to hit the ground running as soon as Article 50 is triggered.  Our programme for Government is based on a clear principle to use the fruits of a strong and well-managed economy to improve the daily lives of our people.  That plan is working.  The economy is growing strongly.  This morning, I had the privilege of announcing a further 500 jobs with an international firm in Dublin.  Last year, more than 1,000 jobs a week we were created and a further 45,000 new jobs are expected later this year.  We continue to invest in tackling the very serious challenges in the health service.  The housing and homelessness crisis is probably the most difficult legacy of the collapse of the housing bubble which we inherited back in 2011.  Bringing housing supply back to sustainable levels and stabilising the rental sector has been a slow process but we have a clear plan and that plan will overcome and deal with this particular challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Our prudent management of the public finances means we are on course to have a balanced budget by 2018.  We recently began work on a national planning framework, which is essential if we are to achieve balanced regional and rural development.  This will be underpinned by a new ten-year national capital plan, which will set out the key infrastructural investments needed to support a post-Brexit Irish economy.  The delivery of these and other initiatives in the programme for Government is what the country needs to meet the very real challenges ahead, not political stunts by the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500057#HHH00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183100,"counter":555,"content":"<p>The issue which has dominated debate during the past week touches on points fundamental to the functioning of our Republic.  Public faith in the integrity of State agencies in general, and the police force in particular, is an essential foundation for democratic institutions.  From the moment I was approached, almost exactly three years ago, about serious allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe, my party's position has been very clear.  The truth must be established and justice must be done.  While there has been a constant effort by one party in this House to promote snide comments about our actions, both in here and through its legion of online trolls, we have been consistent in responding to every substantive piece of information we have received.  We have refused to play politics with this issue.  We have pushed for and secured independent inquiries and have rejected efforts, particularly by the last Government, to declare the matter closed.  Most important, we have maintained ongoing contact to ensure we respected the wishes of those who have suffered most in this scandal.<\/p>  <p>  There is no question but that the Government has, especially over the past week, handled this matter in a casual and an incompetent manner.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers failed to react with appropriate concern when deeply disturbing information was brought to their attention concerning the possible use of a State agency to terrorise an honourable servant of the State.  Their complacency in respect of ensuring this matter would be fully investigated by the proposed inquiry is appalling and is clearly at the heart of its ongoing failure to respond to the many ways in which it was informed about the Tusla file.  While it is not central to the substantive issue, we have no doubt that the T&aacute;naiste knew from multiple sources, including a direct conversation with Deputy O'Callaghan, that requests to broaden the inquiry's terms of reference were specifically founded on the need to include the Tusla file.  Just as when they met each other, members of the Government may have talked but appear never to have listened.<\/p>  <p>  During the last Government, there was clear and obvious evidence of efforts to bury this scandal.  While many in Fine Gael and the Labour Party worked hard to lay all the blame on the former Minister for Justice, they happily went along with the earlier attempts to minimise the importance of the allegations and they dismissed the people making them.  In contrast we have, as of yet, no evidence that this Government has acted in bad faith in its discussions concerning the scope of the inquiry.  There is insurmountable evidence of complacency and incompetence but there has been no attempt to block the establishment of an inquiry with the powers and terms of reference required to establish the truth and provide justice.  The Taoiseach has confirmed to me that he is willing to support an inquiry of the type that Sergeant McCabe is correctly calling for.<\/p>  <p>  If the concern of Deputies is genuinely to deal with this scandal the question before us should deal with the form, terms of reference and funding of an inquiry.  The question before us is not how we get justice for Maurice McCabe and others, however.  It is about whether we should collapse the Government and the D&aacute;il in order to have a general election in the next few weeks.  The sole motivation behind putting this question is party politics.  As we have seen recently in the North, at every given moment Sinn F&eacute;in's primary concern is promoting the interests of the provisional movement.  When it comes across an issue it looks for ways to exploit it rather than to address it.  In the case of the Assembly, it took advantage of an undoubted scandal about an out-of-control scheme which it had known about for a year and which had been made worse by its active promotion by the party's new Northern leader.  Instead of securing an immediate inquiry, it secured an immediate election.  In a vote of confidence in First Minister, Arlene Foster, on 19 December, Sinn F&eacute;in initially abstained but two weeks later, it collapsed the Assembly and the Executive.  As a result, the people of Northern Ireland will have to vote relying on political charges, rather than a definitive and independent review.  The people of Northern Ireland must also go without a voice in critical Brexit discussions and in discussions on the action to take in regard to the hospital crisis, which is their No. 1 concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500058#JJJ00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183100,"counter":556,"content":"<p>No Fianna F&aacute;il candidates will be standing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500058#JJJ00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>The party that embraces corruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500058#JJJ00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Every group will have an opportunity to contribute.

Every one of that party's senior members aggressively attacked me and others for raising now proven allegations about abuse within the provisional movement.  Remember M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill and the treatment meted out to her, and Paudie McGahon.  I was relentlessly attacked by Sinn F&eacute;in for daring to raise those issues, outside and inside this House.  We are still waiting for the first person to respond to its call for witnesses to come forward to the garda&iacute;.  Not one person has come forward.<\/p>  <p>  While the issue of confidence in the Government has been put on the agenda for purely partisan reasons, it has to be addressed.  Our position remains that every Deputy elected to the D&aacute;il has a duty to do everything possible to make the D&aacute;il work.  We reject the idea that the only roles we can play are to support Government in everything or oppose it in everything.  Unlike any other party, Fianna F&aacute;il tried to remove Fine Gael from Government.  We did not just oppose Deputy Kenny and Fine Gael, we repeatedly offered an alternative to them.  We will not take lectures about removing Fine Gael from office from Deputies who sat on their hands when this could have been achieved.  I point out to Deputy Howlin and his colleagues, with their new-found revolutionary zeal, that on 10 March last year each of them voted to support Deputy Kenny's nomination as Taoiseach.  Deputy Rock might also consider the fact that the record of the House has not been erased.  It still contains his multiple crawling speeches on the visionary leadership qualities of the man from whom he is now sprinting away.  It is great to hear that Fine Gael Ministers have rediscovered their voices, having been running from journalists for the past three days.<\/p>  <p>  The confidence and supply arrangement we reached is absolutely transparent about the basis for enabling the Government to be formed and to continue.  In return for a range of guarantees, mainly focused on ending some of the worst policies of the last Government, it has been given the opportunity to get on with its job.  In defiance of all the commentaries, we have played this agreement absolutely straight.  We have been a constructive Opposition in proposing alternatives and, on some occasions, allowing through policies with which we disagreed.  We can point to concrete advances on pensions, a more progressive budget strategy, the suspension of water charges and investment in key educational supports, each of which was achieved in the face of the right-wing agenda of key Fine Gael representatives.<\/p>  <p>  While we have refused to play games, there have been clear breaches of the agreement by the Government and regular provocations from its members.  The last-minute appearance of hundreds of millions in budget spending, the blocking of Deputy O'Callaghan's judicial appointment Bill and the bulldozing through the House of the rent control Bills are examples of this behaviour.  So, too, are the regular statements of Fine Gael Ministers, manoeuvring for the post-Kenny era and claiming that they will \"put manners on those Fianna F&aacute;ilers\".  These comments are both childish and representative of an arrogant party which cannot accept its fall in public support.<\/p>  <p>  The events of this past week have put the agreement under serious strain.  We continue to believe that the Government's policies are leaving too many people behind, that it is drifting and failing to provide leadership, either from the top or in any major policy area.  Most Ministers are focused on their personal future, and on pretending to be external commentators on public affairs, rather than attending to the people's business.  We want a change of Government but we believe this D&aacute;il has not yet fulfilled its obligations to the people, whom we are elected to serve.<\/p><p>My party's priorities are to address this scandal and help our country overcome the many challenges it faces.  There is no evidence that an immediate election would do this.  We will abide by our agreement.  However, there is a point after which all good faith efforts to make this D&aacute;il work will have failed and there will be no alternative but to have an election.  That point is much closer today than it was last week.  It may well be reached if there are further revelations that suggest that the Government has been acting in bad faith in this manner, or if it fails to honour both the spirit and the detail of its agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500058#JJJ00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487183700,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I speak this evening in absolute opposition to the Taoiseach's motion of confidence in himself and his Government.

In their world, political power is not a means to an end, it is an end in itself.  That is the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il way, but as Martin McGuinness has shown it is not the Sinn F&eacute;in way.  No wonder the Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader protest at Martin's decisive leadership.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice McCabe is a man who deserves the thanks of the people of this State.  He is a man of incredible strength.  He and his wife, Lorraine, and their family deserve our support and solidarity.  Their resilience and commitment to each other has been extraordinary.  The twists, turns, lies, spin and the contradictory claims of the Taoiseach and his Ministers in recent days have heightened public outrage.  Citizens do not have confidence in this Government.  The T&aacute;naiste was first up last Thursday to deny any knowledge of contact between the garda&iacute; and other State agencies regarding Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Her position was contradicted both by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and then by Teachta Jim O'Callaghan, who said they had informed her of the Tusla links.

An Teachta O'Callaghan has maintained his position, so we have a senior Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy essentially calling the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, a liar over a very serious issue, yet Fianna F&aacute;il is not prepared to do anything about this.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach too has failed to clarify when and how he became aware of all this.  He refused again this morning.  Having previously denied it, he now admits that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, told him that false accusations made against Maurice McCabe were referred to Tusla.  He says he assured her that all this would be covered by the terms of the then proposed commission of investigation, but unless the Taoiseach has seen these disclosures he had no way of knowing that false accusations brought to him by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, were the false accusations contained in the protected disclosure.  He has yet to explain that, so both his position and that of the T&aacute;naiste are not creditable.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice McCabe's appalling treatment illustrates the absolute need for a culture of openness, transparency and accountability within our policing, justice and political systems.  In the midst of numerous controversies, Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for a new dispensation, for the establishment of an independent policing board similar to that established by the Patten Commission in the North.  Under this process the garda&iacute; would have been accountable to an independent policing authority with full powers to hold them to account.  The Government rejected this again and again.  There is a Policing Authority but the most senior garda, the Commissioner, remains accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  No police service, senior police officer or Garda Commissioner should be solely accountable to any one politician no matter who he or she is.  Therefore, real change has not happened - not of the quality and depth that modern policing and citizens deserve.<\/p>  <p>  Remember the story about someone saying, \"Give me another pint guard, or go to Achill Island\".  Those days are over.  People expect more, but this Government is not capable of delivering a new beginning to policing or delivering for ordinary citizens.  Our health service is creaking under the pressure of cuts and lack of investment.  Record levels of patients are on hospital trolleys.  Children with scoliosis are left in pain for months, sometimes for years, awaiting treatment.  Tens of thousands of patients languish on unacceptable waiting lists.  Front-line staff are left to manage a broken system without necessary resources.  It is clear that this Government is not capable of fixing the problems in health care.<\/p>  <p>  What of the housing emergency?  For decades Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael abandoned the construction of social housing.  They surrendered that to the private sector.  They have driven up the price of rents and left tens of thousands of people, including families, without a home.  Homelessness is now at record levels.  Citizens cannot afford runaway rent increases, yet the State continues to abrogate its responsibility.  In this D&aacute;il Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have co-operated to stop all attempts to bring about rent certainty and proposals to build more social housing.  The Government also refuses to adopt a position of seeking a special position for the island or the North within the EU in the aftermath of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  This is a Government which has undermined confidence in itself.  Everything that is wrong is its own fault.  It is all self-inflicted.  The Government's policy, under the banner of \"keep the recovery going\", is to cut taxes for highest earners, continue to starve our health services, cut capital gains tax, ignore the housing emergency, protect elites and vested interests, and cherish all the bankers of the nation equally.  The policy is to tolerate a crisis in public services, and that means protecting their wealthy friends.<\/p>  <p>  Last year we celebrated the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  Perhaps Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will reflect on what that was all about.  There are very decent people here.  I have never tried to take away the character of one person here.  What was 1916 all about?  Perhaps they will also reflect on how they have advanced on the Proclamation and its principles in the time that their parties have dominated politics here since partition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500059#KKK00800","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183700,"counter":568,"content":"<p>And how you have sullied it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500059#KKK00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1487183700,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will, of course, continue to peddle the line that it is not in the interests of citizens to have an election.

However, we voted against the arrangement cobbled together by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, supported by Independents, that brought this Government about.  We did that because I predicted at the time that it would not last 12 months.  That has yet to be fully tested.<\/p>  <p>  At a time of great challenge for our nation, we have a Government which is intrinsically weak.  The responsibility of governing is too important to lie with a Government that has neither the authority nor the capacity to govern.  When the very notion of collective Cabinet responsibility appears to have been thrown out the window, we can truly begin to see through the crumbling edifice.  A Government that was delivering progress in Ireland would have much work to do with a health service in clear need of remediation, a housing crisis that seems unremitting, rent increases that continue to spiral and, of course, Brexit, the shadow of which looms large over our future prosperity.  On top of all that, we have a range of issues this intrinsically weak Government has not even considered tackling, including water charges, the eighth amendment, the funding of third level education, the baptism barrier in our schools and, of course, whistleblowing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no issue the Government seems sufficiently to believe requires resolute and real action.  My party believes the power of the State should be an enabler of good.  In those circumstances, this weakened State is profoundly depressing.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last week or so, things have gotten more serious.  From doing nothing, the Government has actually begun to do harm.  Over the last week, we heard a great deal about the anguish and agony imposed on the McCabe family.  We are beginning to hear similar stories from elsewhere, including from the Harrison family.  In truth, the fumbling by the Government on this critical issue has only added to that agony.  Faced with a crisis of this nature, one would expect a Government to gather together to discuss openly the best way to tackle such an important issue and to propose measures that could reassure the public as well as give solace to the victims.  Instead, we have seen senior Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il figures stop just short of calling each other liars.  More worryingly, we have seen the Taoiseach and one of his senior Ministers do exactly the same.  Yesterday, this tawdry mess managed to get even worse.  The Taoiseach stood in this Chamber and gave two versions of the same event within 15 minutes.  After a week of public disquiet, the debate we are having this evening has become all about the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I worked closely with the Taoiseach for five full years and more in a Government which has been maligned but which will, in time, be recognised for its significant achievements.  During our time in government, we disagreed on many points.  We come from different traditions and we were not afraid to trash those differences out.  I have had since the election cause to reflect on our failings and mistakes as well as on our achievements but on balance I still believe we did a great deal of good.  Some of the good we did is in this actual territory.  The whistleblower legislation we implemented is recognised as world class and the creation of the Policing Authority was a ground-breaking move which had long been sought.  Despite our many disagreements, we got a great deal done together.  Participating in this debate tonight, it gives me no joy to see the position in which the Taoiseach now finds himself.  There are many on the Taoiseach's side of the House as well as on this side who are waiting for his time as Taoiseach to come to an end.  Some of them, perhaps, share the Front Bench with him.  If this debate proves to be a tipping point which brings that end closer, the Taoiseach should know that he has made a significant contribution to the State.  He should also know, however, that the events of the last week are not an acceptable way for a country to be governed.<\/p>  <p>  I emphasise an important point that has been aired too little in the debate over recent days.  Article 28.4.2&deg; defines how collective Cabinet responsibility shall operate in Ireland.  There are many other clauses in our Constitution which lawyers and academics dispute and which can be debated in different contexts, but this is not one of them.  To remind the House, Article 28.4.2&deg; reads: \"The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government\".  This is not optional.  One cannot decide that some issues are decided collectively and others are not.  One cannot decide that one does not want to hear any more about an issue when one's own Minister mentions it.  It is not acceptable.  Too many people over recent days have suggested that the notion of collective Cabinet responsibility is some sort of historical nicety.  It is not.  It is the highest law of this land and it is being flagrantly ignored by members of the Taoiseach's Government.  I was genuinely shocked to hear yesterday and today how this Government does its business.  It is one thing to bring a sensitive memo to Government under a Minister's elbow.  I have done it myself.  It is quite another when that sensitive memo proposes a Government order for a commission of investigation based on a judge's report which has not been circulated.  How on earth can anyone in government be expected to know what he or she is agreeing to investigate?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, presumed her concerns were included in the terms of reference.  She was entitled to assume the Tusla affair was included in the protected disclosure referenced in the terms of reference, but she never got to see the protected disclosure so she never got to know her presumption was right.  Everyone in government is now citing the law to justify their failure to inform colleagues but there is nothing in the law to prevent the T&aacute;naiste from sharing details from the protected disclosure with her colleagues in government if they needed to know them.  As the former Minister who introduced the Protected Disclosures Act, I remind the Government that section 16 specifically allows information to be disclosed where that disclosure is considered necessary to investigate the matter or is in the public interest.  Neither does the law prevent Deputy Zappone as Minister from demanding information from Tusla and sharing it with Cabinet.  It is the only way collective Cabinet Government can work.  Nevertheless, the Taoiseach continued to insist today that he was restricted by law from asking questions about the protected disclosure.  There is no such restriction because there is no such law.  That has as much basis in reality as the Taoiseach's advice to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to take a good note.<\/p>  <p>  I said at the outset that I had no confidence in the Government when it was formed.  After the events of the last week, I cannot in conscience support the Government now.  Therefore, the Labour Party Deputies will oppose the Government's motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500060#LLL00200","speaker":"1353"}]
