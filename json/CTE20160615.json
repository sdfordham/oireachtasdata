I am sure that the outcome of the committee's work will be a major improvement on the <i>status quo<\/i>resulting in better fiscal policy decisions and better outcomes for the State.<\/p><p>I, together with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, forwarded a submission to the committee on behalf of the Government on 2 June which, I assume, we can take as read.  The overall objective is to get to a situation where the D&aacute;il has the right information and the time to provide costed proposals for inclusion in the expenditure and revenue plans to be presented by the Government in the budget each October.  For this to work as intended, the D&aacute;il's input will need to be supplied as early as possible in September.<\/p><p>There is an inherent conflict between providing the right up-to-date information and providing information early.  Aside from common sense, it is also a legal requirement that budgetary planning uses the most up-to-date information.  This means that there is a limited window available for the preparation of some documents, such as the stability programme update.  Providing earlier drafts would mean using out-of-date forecasts.  Taking account of this constraint, we are looking at ways to bring forward the publication of draft documents with the most up-to-date information to give the D&aacute;il time to consider them and make recommendations on the amendments before their final adoption.<\/p><p>Key to this process will be the need for the budget oversight committee to interact with other stakeholders and expert bodies, such as the European Commission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the ESRI.  A better informed D&aacute;il will be able to consider and adopt <i>ex ante<\/i>input for Government to consider in the formulation of budgetary plans.  A better informed D&aacute;il will be better placed to scrutinise a Government's budgetary plans when they are produced.<\/p><p>That is all I want to say by way of preliminary remarks but I am open to answering any questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#P00300","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Are any members offering?

During this process we have heard from some of the officials here and others that the key objective, as I understand it, is that we get the Opposition in at a very early stage prior to the completion of the Estimates and the budget process in order that budget day does not descend upon the rest of the Parliament like something from outer space.  I have argued during our hearings here that we should, as much as possible, try to implement this initiative in the 2017 budget process and not just wait for the 2018 process.  I am particularly interested in how the Minister thinks it would be possible this month and next month to involve the sectoral committees - where I think a lot of the work has to be done, and not just in a budget scrutiny committee whenever it is formally fully established.  <\/p> <p>  I shall outline one of the key objectives that we should strive for.  The committees, with their Minister and Department, should be involved in considering some of the bids from Departments for spending or possibly tax raising measures, where that is appropriate, in the summer period rather than waiting for the autumn.  A line Minister may have an initiative or idea.  As I recall and understand the Estimates process, there would be dialogue between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance and the relevant Department throughout the summer period.  This would mean that options could be considered by the committees, particularly sectoral committees, in the summer period rather than waiting for the autumn.  We should put a fairly demanding pressure on the committees, as they are set up in the coming weeks, to do just that as part of the 2017 budget process rather than waiting for the autumn period.  Is such an initiative possible?<\/p> <p>  I asked the Taoiseach this question during the Order of Business in the week before last. I got a sense from him that such a goal would meet with the Government's overall objectives of ensuring that politics work in a different way in this period.  Is it possible for the sectoral committees, in the Minister's mind, to engage with Ministers and Departments to consider, not just the overall Vote aggregate, but to go down into some of the detailed propositions that Departments or Ministers may have, in the summer period, as part of that dialogue the Minister for Finance mentioned in his submission?  He stated that we need to get right and evolve the national economic dialogue and have spring and summer statements, etc.  Can we get sectoral committees to look at big proposals this summer rather than this autumn? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#Q00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>First, by way of background, starting from today, the first opportunity that the D&aacute;il will have to discuss the budget will be next week because we are hoping to publish the summer economic statement after the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  I understand that it is going into the D&aacute;il on Thursday so there will be a Second Stage-type debate on that and all of the basic data, to date, will be published in that statement.  From the point of view of Deputy Ryan's question, that will give us the latest estimate of the scope there will be for the 2017 budget in terms of tax reductions and increased expenditure.  In other words, the so-called fiscal space will be identified.  On Tuesday, if one thinks of it in sporting terms, the pitch will be lined on which the game will be played so one will know the parameters of what is available going forward.  After that the national economic dialogue will take place on 27 and 28 June in Dublin Castle.  The intention is that all of the members of this committee will be invited to participate in the dialogue and will act as a link with the rest of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Invitations will also be extended to the interest groups in society, which range from the employers to the unions, the social pillar and to the various organisations that are normally consulted.  The event will last two days.  We will have plenary sessions and breakout groups to deal with particular topics.<\/p><p>This will give a view of the objectives of the organised interest groups in society in terms of increased spending and we will listen to them very carefully.<\/p><p> The next step is that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will publish earlier than usual the mid-year expenditure report.  I will let him deal with that but the intention is that on a no policy change basis, he will set out his requirements across Departments for 2017.  The combination of identifying the fiscal space and the publication of the Minister's document on expenditure will give the line committees sufficient information to debate the adequacy or otherwise of what is available.  However, the fiscal rules mean that there are boundaries to what can be done, and it is within those boundaries that the choices will have to be made.  That is the way it will go.<\/p><p> On the tax side, it is normal to publish the papers of the tax strategy group, which is comprised of both departmental officials and Revenue staff, which look at the various tax options.  Again, those papers provide basic data such as the consequences of an increase in VAT.  My intention is to publish those early this year.  They were always published after the budget so that one got a rear view mirror look of the tax assessment by the officials who were advising the Minister prior to the budget.  This time I would like to publish them in mid or late July and supply them to Members.  In that way, Deputies will have an identification of the fiscal space, the first cut at the Estimates from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the tax policy documents that are under consideration by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  Again, my aim and that of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is that on the lead-in to the budget, Parliament or the D&aacute;il would have the same information as the Ministers so that if Deputies want to make alternative proposals, they can do so.<\/p><p> How it will work out between the different committees is hard to predict.  One possibility is that members of the health committee will want as much money as they can get while the members of the justice or education committees will have a similar approach, but if one interest group takes all, then there is nothing left for the others.  This is the position we are in when trying to determine the best policy position.  At the end of the day, we are bound by the constitutional position that it is the Government which brings forward the Estimates and the budget, but our commitment is to take the views of the D&aacute;il into account in the formulation of the budget and to give Members all the information they need to decide on one option over another.<\/p><p> We will have the summer economic statement followed by the event in Dublin Castle, to which Members will be invited.  That will be followed by the publication of the Estimates, which Deputy Donohoe will deal with, followed by the provision of the tax strategy papers in mid to late July and then the process will run on.  In my introductory remarks I said that it is not possible to finalise matters in July or August because the statistics keep moving.  The White Paper that is published on the Friday before the budget is the last piece of data that is available and it is only published at the very end of the process because there is a constitutional obligation on the Government to base its budget on the latest available accurate data.  If we try to do it in July or August, the numbers will have changed by the time we get to the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#Q00400","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>There are a number of members who want to ask questions before-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#R00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I wish to respond briefly to what the Minister has said.  To get back to the key point, the Minister said that in terms of individual spending proposals there will be space for the Opposition to present alternative proposals.  However, what I am saying is that during the period when the issues are being debated between line Departments and Ministers and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform the process should be more open.  In other words, the individual Ministers or Departments who have proposals should be discussing them in sectoral committees in the summer period.  Ultimately, that will empower Ministers and empower the process in terms of teasing things out and widening the responsibility because if one is going to spend more in one area, one may have to cut back in another.  If it is just a process whereby the Opposition contributes proposals but does not get a chance to debate the Departments' proposals then we are not doing what the OECD suggested, namely engaging with the Departments in an active way.  That cannot just be done in September or October.  It must be done in the June-July period, as well as the national economic dialogue and all of the other elements to which the Minister referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#S00100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I would prefer the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with that issue.

However, a White Paper will still have to be produced just before the budget, because the figures change as the year goes on.  In order to provide accurate information before the budget, the practice has been to publish such a paper on the Friday night before the budget, with the Budget Statement envisaged to be delivered on the Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.<\/p> <p>  Whatever we do by way of preliminary White Papers, there will still have to be a final White Paper in order to be accurate.  That might lead to confusion and quite substantial variations between something that is produced in July and something that is produced on the Friday night before the budget.  There is a conflict between providing information early and the accuracy of that information.  I am quite prepared to work to see whether we can narrow that conflict as much as possible.  However, there is a conflict because the situation develops as the year goes on until the weekend before the budget, and we finalise the details at that stage.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the budgetary office.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a good idea.  It should be within the control of the Houses of the Oireachtas and responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It does not come out of a departmental Vote - I understand the money comes from the Central Fund, and funding arrangements would have to be made on that basis.<\/p> <p>  We need something in place to ensure that two sets of costings would not be released.  If the Deputy tables a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to ask him what the annual cost of certain decisions would be and a budgetary office came up with a different figure, which is quite possible, we would need some mechanism to reconcile the figures.  There would have to be a relationship between the budgetary office and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, and perhaps line Departments, to allow the budgetary office to be independent while at the same time having some mechanism for reconciling figures. <\/p> <p>  We are in the business of doing things differently and having a bigger role for the D&aacute;il and Parliament.  I want to co-operate with that, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has the same approach.  We are not claiming any monopoly on wisdom.  All we are doing today is outlining to the committee what we have decided, with its agreement, should happen this year.  I understand the committee has a mandate as a type of scoping committee.  It is not actually a budgetary committee.  The committee can carry out exercises and advice can be provided, and we will see where things land.  The ultimate objective is that there will be a greater role for the Parliament and more parliamentary input and scrutiny.

I hope I get the same time as everybody else.  I thank him for his clarification.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Ministers.  The Government's submission was helpful in the sense that it set out the new budgetary cycle.  We have had discussions on this.  As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, put it, we are a scoping or arrangements committee which is considering putting in place a new budgetary scrutiny committee.  I want to hear his views on how we can make that committee as empowered as possible.  In response to the previous matter, the Minister said he wants greater parliamentary input and scrutiny.  There will be no end of scrutiny, but we can differ on input in terms of the powers the committee will have.<\/p> <p>  Article 17.2 of the Constitution will be crucial because if the Opposition or Members of the Oireachtas in general cannot move money Bills or amendments which include a financial charge, that will limit the ability of the committee to have an input into policy.  The Minister said he was open to new ideas.  Perhaps he can expand on that.  Would he agree that the current constitutional constraints make it difficult for us to have a genuine input?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the relationship between sectoral committees and the new budgetary scrutiny committee that will be established.  In the Minister's paper on the circulation of tax strategy group papers, it is stated that such papers would be scrutinised by the relevant sectoral committees which can then consider developing recommendations they might wish to submit to Government.  I presume the Minister would want the new budgetary scrutiny committee to examine the same papers and make recommendations.  Interestingly, the paper only refers to existing tax measures.  One of the things I hope the new budgetary scrutiny committee will be in a position to do is examine not just Government proposals, existing tax measures or even expenditure but also alternatives.  It is not all about the Government's ideas.  What is the Minister's view on that?<\/p> <p>  I refer to off-balance-sheet budgeting, which is becoming more of a feature.  The Taoiseach wrote to President Juncker on the use of PPPs, for example, in off-balance-sheet budgeting.  Would the Minister see a role for the new budgetary scrutiny committee in that area at a macro level?  Would it be an area into which we would have more of an input in terms of policy?  I would certainly see it in that light.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to information flows.  Given the new budgetary cycle, there would be no shortage of information.  One of the key failings up to now that I have identified - and to which the parliamentary reform committee that gave this committee its mandate referred - is the quality of the information we receive.  Sometimes getting information from different Departments can be like pulling teeth.  What is the view of the Minister on how we can improve the quality of the information given to the Oireachtas in general?<\/p> <p>  I refer to costings, which have been mentioned.  This has been an issue for a long number of years.  There was some confusion about what was in the programme for Government and our terms of reference, and what has been called a parliamentary budget office.  How will the Oireachtas have much greater access to having proposals costed?  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform currently provides a very small window of opportunity in that regard, namely, a number of weeks before the budget.  A much greater period needs to be provided.  What is the view of the Minister on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#W00100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a lot of questions, but they all relate to the same area.

I do not have a view because I should not have a view.  It is a matter for the committees and I do not want to influence their work in any way.  Parliamentary work should be a matter for Parliament.<\/p> <p>  It is not true to say that Parliament does not have a role in budgetary formation.  It has an absolute role.  No budget or finance Bill passes without a majority vote of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>No social welfare Bill passes without a majority vote of the D&aacute;il so there is absolute control by the D&aacute;il over the budgetary actions of Government.  What is being argued about is whether, as well as that absolute control, the D&aacute;il should have an input in the formation of budgetary policy - a hands-on executive role - rather than an advisory role or a scrutiny role.  That is fair enough but every democracy needs a parliament and every democracy also needs an executive to do the work on a full-time basis and bring forward proposals.  As we attempt to change the balance, I would not favour taking away the functions of the Executive and giving them to a committee of Parliament because we might arrive at a situation where we would have no budget.  I know of no country in the world that is governed simply by a parliamentary committee process.  There is always an executive and there must be something in the powers of the executive.<\/p><p> I was asked a number of questions about costings.  I agree there should be a budgetary committee that would be independent of the Departments and of the Government and responsible to the D&aacute;il.   Deputy Pearse Doherty was probably the first person to mention that in recent years and I agreed with him very quickly that it would be a good reform and I am fully supportive of that.  I do not indicate that I would support constitutional change.  The Constitution has been operating for a long time.  Such matters were very carefully considered and a certain role was given to the Executive and to the Parliament.  If we were to try to rebalance the situation, which is essentially what we are talking about, we should try to do so in a way that makes the system more effective and accountable, but I do not think we should make radical change without due consideration.  This is a scoping committee and it is up to it to do the consideration and to make any proposals it wants about how the respective duties should be rebalanced.  That is what the committee is about.  At the end of the day my view will not count.  It is the view of the D&aacute;il that will count.

Again, it is a question of balance.  The Minister is correct.  There was a significant change that made a massive difference to the fiscal space.  My view is that providing the report in mid-April is not striking the right balance.

I urge the Minister to consider that point if he would.<\/p> <p>  The next point is relevant to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the White Paper.  The reason the White Paper was so important was because it was the only chance we got to look at the no policy change numbers, and if one is coming up with counter-proposals that is what one needs.  To get that information at midnight on a Friday before a Tuesday budget was always too late.  There is no policy change in this SPU, which is very useful, but it was done in the context of there being no Government in place.  As a parliamentarian seeking to propose budgetary ideas, the most useful piece of information for me in the past five years was the no-change budget, both in terms of revenue and, critically, of expenditure.  That information does not come through.  In fact, it takes even longer than the White Paper because the White Paper does the revenue.  We need some mechanism to ensure the no-change figures are in.

The key to this will be the timeliness of information and its adequacy.  In that context, I ask the Minister whether certain areas of information, which are standard in the flow of information from Departments to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, can be published on a timely basis.  For instance, each Department prepared extensive notes for each Minister on taking office.  They were like doorstoppers in some or perhaps all cases.  I never have understood why they should not simply be published in full.  They obviously are subject to freedom of information requests by journalists but I do not see why Members of Parliament should be obliged to use freedom of information to get them.  In the context of the new politics, could there be an agreement whereby one week or ten days or even three days after the Minister received such briefings, they simply could be published?  They would be extremely valuable for the sectoral committees and absolutely essential for this committee.  While obviously one would not be able to read them all at once, they would give one a general background on specific areas and would reflect departmental advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#Z01000","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>We did publish them in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#Z01100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>As did my Department and I completely agree with the Deputy.

On the details of taxation, the most important issue is to have information about the costings and profiles on tax, and this point relates to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  All Departments make bids at various times during the year and continually regarding things they would like to do.  Again, that information crystallises as the budget approaches.  Does the Minister have a view as to how much of that information can be made available, if this committee is to be able to be involved in a genuine way in the budget discussion?<\/p> <p>  As for my final question to the Minister for Finance, I have a practical example.  While budget discussions of Estimates are taking place in the D&aacute;il today, Members were not able to get the Estimates until approximately one hour ago.  As the Ministers are aware, it is quite tricky to have a detailed analysis on a sectoral basis, and today's debate will be on health and education.  Will the Minister give an undertaking or explain why there has been such a mess in respect of the Estimates this year?.  It is almost six months into the financial year and all that information is available, certainly up to the end of May.  Why is this information and the information on the other Estimates not available?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the relationship with the European Union and the Minister might talk to members about this matter at a subsequent stage.  At present in the European Union, there is a build-up of different rules for different countries.  This is because although there is a general EU fiscal framework, to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks, and a fiscal space, it increasingly is being interpreted in different ways for different countries.  Does the Minister have a view because with the budgetary oversight committee, the EU fiscal framework obviously is a significant issue?  If the rules keep being changed, will the Minister provide a mechanism to update members on his view of the current approach by the EU structures to Ireland, that is, whether we would get the same leeway as or less leeway than France?  I do not expect the Minister to answer all of that now, but if this committee is to do its job in the context of budget scrutiny, its members must get a sense of the current position of the EU and ECOFIN, in that France now gets two extra years, Spain certainly got one extra year, I believe Portugal also got an extra year and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#AA00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I must put the question.

That is what we seek to do in the mid-year report.  My objective is to be able to produce for each sectoral committee the best estimate as to what we believe are the no policy change figures in order that Members will know the truest starting point for the framing of the 2017 budget.<\/p><p>The effect of having that information earlier in the year than normal should be positive for the deliberations.  The Chairman acknowledged how helpful they were in the past.<\/p><p> Deputy Burton raised questions to which I can respond.  The Deputy asked about the sharing of information made available to me regarding the expenditure profiles of individual Departments.  I will look to see if we can do that.  It is a fair point.  I appreciate the recognition of the committee that the information can be lumpy - it can change.  The best example of all this is with regard to the profiling of capital expenditure.  Deputy Burton and other colleagues will be aware that the profile of capital expenditure changes across the year.  For example, the roads budget in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with which I would have been familiar, was discharged to a significant extent in particular months of the year.  As long as the committee is aware that information that we are sharing may change for real, objective reasons beyond our control, we will look to see how we can respond in that regard.  The best way we might be able to do so is by having a think about the format in which we would share the information with the committee, which will indicate that the position could change from month to month.  We will respond to the Chairman regarding how we will do it.<\/p><p> In relation to the bids that individual Ministers might make to my Department at different points of the year, the best way of handling that would be through engagement with the sectoral committees.  I am sure Ministers will use the opportunity to go in front of their sectoral committees to articulate the additional projects they would like to do during the year, which they are talking to me about as well.  I hope that the mid-year expenditure report that we will publish in a few weeks' time will go some way towards giving the entire House an awareness of what individual Ministers are trying to do across the year.<\/p><p> In relation to the Estimates, I respectfully would not describe it as a mess, but I wish we had been in a different place to do it.

I also welcome their acknowledgement of the importance of the independence of the budget office.  I have a further question to expand on that.  I am interested in the Minister's views on having the budgetary office set up as an independent statutory body.  The reason I ask is that in Canada there were controversies about the budgetary office because it was not seen to be independent.  We need to be careful not to go down that road here.  If we want this to work effectively and we want to be able to scrutinise budgets and, indeed, the Departments of Deputies Noonan and Donohoe, it is critical that the budgetary office be seen to be independent and set up on a statutory basis.<\/p><p>Finally, in the event of the scenario being that there is an independent budgetary office, what would be the most effective role for the fiscal council?

That is something that should be considered by this committee.  The budgetary office must exist and work within the framework of the Constitution, and we have already had a discussion on that.<\/p> <p>  The role of the fiscal council is very much a matter for the Minister for Finance.  There are clear roles that the fiscal council must provide, for example, in relation to the deficit and how we engage with European institutions.

It would have been good to get the opportunity to ask him a question but I appreciate his time was limited.<\/p> <p>  The conversations we have had over the last number of meetings have centred around getting information early.  It has been the general consensus that if we do not get information earlier, effectively, we will not make any substantial changes in how we conduct the budgetary process.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, outlined that early information may not be totally accurate, that it could lead to confusion and that there could be substantial variance between information received in July come September-October.  However, given the weight and importance that this committee is attaching to getting information early, I suggest that while there may be teething problems and difficulties, it is worth trying to do that.  If there are problems, let us review that for next year but we should at least endeavour to get that information.  Taking on board the possibility that it may be inaccurate and lead to problems, it is worth trying to do it this year given that it has been the main topic for discussion over recent meetings.<\/p> <p>  I had a question for the Minister, Deputy Noonan, which his officials might relay to him.  He felt there would be a serious conflict between getting accurate information and getting information early.  If the Minister identifies clear obstacles to providing that information and says he cannot do that, he should tell us why.  Perhaps this committee can offer some solutions to overcome that obstacle - that is what we are here for.  Similarly, with the tax documents due to come out in mid-July, I would agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that gives us very little time to digest that information.  I appreciate the Minister stated we can sit through August - nobody has any difficulty with that - but changes would need to be made to facilitate us to assess those documents.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, stated he envisaged sectoral engagement would happen after the summer economic statement.  Deputy Eamon Ryan, I suppose, was trying to make the point that what we are looking to do is engage effectively with the Departments and the proposals they are putting forward.  The Minister did not go quite as far as saying we would get the opportunity to do that.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, before Deputy Donohoe spoke, suggested that we would be coming in after the tax strategy papers are produced and we would then get an opportunity to put forward proposals from the Opposition benches.  I am merely looking for clarification as to when the Minister sees the sectoral committees engaging.

It will take a little bit of time, across this year, to understand better the views of the Oireachtas regarding how that information can be presented and figure out how we can best respond.

Information comes to the Cabinet on a structured basis about where we are with expenditure.

I think it was Deputy Donnelly who mentioned at the start that the process kicks off in the November with the annual growth survey.  The document is very generic and is not really a part of the process.  For us, the process really kicks off in mid to late February when we get the Commission's forecasts because all member states are required to base their stability programmes on the Commission's numbers.<\/p> <p>  Another key obstacle is that we do not have the outturn for the economy for the previous year until mid to late March of the current year.  The CSO will only publish to Q4 and hence the full years figures are available towards the end of March.  We need that information before we can begin the whole endorsement exercise with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  That timeframe is not going to change. <\/p> <p>  One other final consideration is that we must go through, like all member states, an excessive deficit clarification process or EDP.  As part of what we call the Maastricht returns, we have to send figures to EUROSTAT that must be validated.  That process only occurs at the end of March each year.  Every member state is in the same boat.  There are a lot of iterations between EUROSTAT at the centre and the national statistical offices and the finance Ministries on the periphery.  All figures have to be checked.  We only get final notification from EUROSTAT that the figures are okay in the first or second week of April.   <\/p> <p>  Finally, we have been totally transparent in terms of whether the committee and the Parliament should get the numbers when we give them to IFAC.  For the past three years, since IFAC has been given an endorsement function, we have appeared in front of the finance committee and presented the exact same presentation that we have given to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, and we have put that out there in public.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#EE01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty can ask a brief final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#EE01200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I only questioned the Minister for Finance earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#EE01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I apologise and realise the Deputy has more questions.

In terms of the information that is required, the proposal from Government is that at the six-month point the expenditure data will be released to the Parliament, be discussed and so forth, but we have a problem with timing, in the same way as we do with other data.  If the data is only released in the middle or at the end of July, it will not get to the sectoral committees early enough unless we sit through August.  While that possibility is up for debate, I cannot imagine there will be a huge appetite for it.  There is a problem in that regard, but if the reports are going to be provided on a monthly basis, that will deal with it.  I ask the Minister to provide clarity on that point because if there is a monthly report, which would be very welcome, it would take away from the six-monthly report.  Obviously we can have a wider discussion on the six-monthly report but the idea of a July information dump is problematic.  While we all want information, we also know that information could be dumped on the committee without giving it enough time to scrutinise it.  That is what we see with a lot of the information provided.  The information in the stability programme update, for example, is excellent, and I commend the officials who put it to together.  Equally, the Fiscal Advisory Council's reports are excellent in terms of the level of data and analysis contained therein.  However, the problem is that we only have a set piece in which to discuss them; we need a wider opportunity.  The same issue will arise with the six-monthly expenditure review.  It will be an information dump and we will only scratch the surface of it.  We will ask the Minister a question or two and that will be it.  That is the reality.  That is why I take issue with the assertion by the Minister for Finance that there is detailed scrutiny of all of this data, because there is not.  Let us be realistic.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and other committees.  Oireachtas committees do not scrutinise proposals adequately.  That is the reality.  We get five or ten minutes to question officials from the Department of Finance, for example.  That is not real information scrutiny.  I agree with point made earlier that the best information we got on the stability programme update came from sitting down with officials from the Department and teasing out certain issues, which gave us a much better understanding of the data.  I ask the Minister to verify that the month-by-month publication of data will actually occur, instead of just a set piece, six-monthly event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#GG00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>On the timing of the mid-year expenditure report, the objective of that document is to give us a starting point for the budget for the following year.

The idea that I have taken on board, from what Deputy Burton suggested earlier, is that we make available to the committee the same information that comes to Cabinet.  I will check the frequency of that, but my recollection or understanding is that such information is available on a quarterly basis.  That deals with the problem that I outlined earlier in terms of flows across each month, because a 12-week period will be long enough to allow me to net that out and be confident that I am sharing decent information with Deputies.<\/p><p>All I would say is that I will work to share with the committee 12-week expenditure reports if that is the frequency with which they come to Cabinet.

Some of the challenges and the frustrations we have are in trying to delve below the headline figures.  The officials in the Department will know this - we talk about the fiscal space and the net in gross fiscal space, and it reduces because of demographic pressures.  I do not know how many times I have tabled questions seeking a breakdown of the demographic pressure in the Department of Education of Skills or the Department of Health.  We have a gross figure for demographic pressure, yet no Department can tell us what is its portion.  Further, they cannot tell us what that actually means.  For example, if it is &euro;100 million in terms of the Department of Education and Skills, does that equate to, say, 100 teachers or a certain number of schools?  What happens in government on budget day, regardless of what Government is in place, is that it has increased the budget by a certain amount and that equates to a certain number of teachers or nurses, but when one delves behind the figure, sometimes it does not even meet the demographic needs.  It is important that type of information is provided.  Those are my two key concerns - the quality of information and the flow of information.<\/p> <p>  My last question concerns the budget of the Department of Health.  The agreement between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il states that it would be verifiable.  How is it intended to have the expenditure for the Department of Health verified next year given that last year's expenditure was way off the mark?  It was interesting that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said he only found out on 20 April that the AIB transaction was going to be dealt with by expenditure.  Therefore, we can only assume that the Government was planning a stability programme update that would have resulted in significant cutbacks for the remainder of the year for the Department of Health because the Minister was not in a position to allocate that amount of money to the Department of Health or, indeed, any other Department had it not been for the luck it got in the EUROSTAT ruling against the State.  It is interesting that was happening.  To go back to the core issue, how does the Minister intend the information will be verifiable and where does he see the role of a budgetary committee in fulfilling that commitment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#HH00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Even in my early weeks in the Department, in trying to look at how we will manage this process with the Oireachtas, that is a key factor, but obviously all this has to take place within the constitutional architecture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016061500002#JJ00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1465981200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.
