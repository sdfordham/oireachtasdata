Not only did she fail to mention him by name but she also outlined in her speech a series of issues of concern to her which were not being progressed within the Department.  This is hardly a sign of her faith not only in the Minister but also the entire machinery of government.  She outlined her concern about the \"lack of priority afforded to producing the free GP care legislation\", which is one of the commitments of the programme for Government.  She also expressed concern about the introduction of the universal health insurance.  After 18 months as a Minister of State, she continues to ask basic questions about the model on which universal health insurance will be based.

The welfare of animals is extremely important in Ireland and regardless of whether people have animals as pets, for commercial use, as farmers or whatever the case may be, it is important to introduce and have in place legislation.  I am delighted this Bill has been allocated so much time for debate.<\/p><p>  The Bill aims to address two separate but related themes.  On animal health, the Bill sets down a number of rules aimed at preventing the spread of disease.  It also sets out much clearer definitions of what is expected of people who own animals, as well as those whose responsibility it is to care for them.  This legislation will empower the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deal efficiently and effectively with all current or potential disease threats to farming livestock.  It also will allow the Minister to declare that the State or a part thereof is a disease eradication area.  This will allow the country to tackle any future outbreaks in a co-ordinated and aggressive fashion.  As for our history of tackling animal diseases, particularly brucellosis, tuberculosis and others, I note much progress has been made.  However, this has cost a lot of money and in the future, I will welcome the introduction of new and better ways of detecting and eradicating disease.  I refer to the blood testing for tuberculosis, which I believe will constitute a major step forward and I hope for and look forward to the day when it will become a reality.<\/p><p>That is because testing is costly for animal owners not only in terms of finance but also in time and we should find a more efficient and effective way to deal with the matter.<\/p><p> Section 8 Bill will impose obligations on animal owners or carers to take all the necessary precautions to ensure that animals do not stray.  Common sense requirements will be introduced to ensure that appropriate infrastructure, such as fencing and buildings, is provided by the owner.  This will act as a substantial prevention measure to reduce the spread of disease.  In the event of an outbreak a person would be required to show that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the spread of disease or at the very least minimise the impact on himself and his neighbours.<\/p><p> Given the increase in prominence of our agriculture sector these measures are necessary to ensure a profitable and sustainable future for the agricultural industry.  It would be foolish for us not to take these steps and I have no doubt of the positive impact they will have on our industry, an industry that has great potential for growth.  In order to get out of the recession striking the country I have no doubt that food and agricultural industry provides a gateway.  There is an opportunity for us to develop and extend given that we have done so much on our animal production and have a clean food image.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, his predecessor, farming organisations and farmers themselves have done so much in this respect.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, in particular is striving to pursue this agenda which will greatly benefit those who are unemployed.<\/p><p> On animal welfare, the Bill provides for harsher punishments and greater preventative powers in the area of animal cruelty.  Some of these measures are long overdue particularly when it comes to the mistreatment of domestic animals and the weak punishment of those found guilty of cruelty.  While obviously protecting the work done by veterinary surgeons as well as those partaking in hunting, fishing and coursing, for the first time this legislation will make animal mutilation a specific offence.<\/p><p> With regard to country sports and country pursuits, particularly coursing and fishing, a growing number of people have an agenda to try to get sports such as coursing banned.  I understand that many strong speeches were made in this House last night.  I come from an area of the country that has a very strong tradition of coursing.  Given the way those coursing meetings are guarded and protected, I would challenge any of those people opposed to those sports to come and see at first hand exactly how they are run.  Too much is being written and said about those sports which are major tourism attractions, particularly hunting and fishing.  There is great potential for tourists fishing on the lakes and rivers throughout the country.  Some people have an agenda to suggest to the public that those sports are cruel.  The people involved in those sports are committed to animal welfare and protecting all the animals involved.  We should protect them and regulate them, but they should be seen as a benefit to people and to the country's tourism industry.  That is a matter that needs to be introduced into this debate.<\/p><p> I would welcome the opportunity to bring some of those people, who talk about how cruel those pursuits are, down to my part of the country so that they could see how those rural pursuits are being carried out.  I can guarantee that they would have a completely different attitude rather than making statements in the D\u00e1il that they believe appeal to the public.  I challenge them, and particularly those Members of this House, to come with me to the coursing in Clonmel and Cashel, and to the fishing in Golden.  They could come to any place in my constituency and see how the people in that area look after those animals and look after their sports.<\/p><p> It is very welcome to have the Bill before the House.  Some farmers were concerned that there might be over-regulation.  The reality is that people who are good at animal husbandry and are committed to their animals have nothing to fear from the Bill.  I welcome that these provisions will be put on a statutory basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000007#E05600","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348136400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Tom Hayes that the vast majority of people involved in agriculture and animal husbandry who have good practices have nothing to fear from this legislation.  I welcome the updating of the legislation which goes back over 100 years dealing with cruelty to animals and animal diseases.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and the provisions outlining basic requirements for looking after animals on farms and elsewhere.  It is not before time in that regard.<\/p><p>  I wish to focus on some areas not referred to by previous speakers.  I agree with the harsher punishments for those found guilty of cruelty to animals contained in the legislation.  There can be no hiding place for people who would engage in wanton cruelty to animals.  As someone who has lived in the countryside all of my life, I could not defend people who behave in a cruel way towards creatures of any sort and I welcome the legislation in that regard.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to remind the Minister of some matters I have mentioned previously to him and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I refer to the care of dogs and some of the puppy shelters and dog shelters which are essential and carry out important work in collecting dogs that have been abandoned by owners.  However, I have some reservations about some of the controls and with regard to those who accept or take dogs from these shelters, particularly in connection with their suitability to look after the animals.  There have been a number of very serious incidents of attacks by dogs on flocks of sheep in my constituency in recent months.  Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the dogs in question may have been dogs that had been in pounds or shelters and were taken by people who did not have the wherewithal to look after them.  There is strong evidence to suggest that some of the dogs belonged to families that may have been relatively new to rural areas and did not understand the dangers associated with owning a dog in a rural area if that dog is not controlled.<\/p><p>In the cases of which I have spoken a great deal of damage was done to the sheep and the farmers suffered great financial loss and distress.  As a young child I saw sheep that had been attacked.  It was not a pleasant sight.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan who is responsible for dog pounds and the regulations governing such premises around the country, to embark on a renewed campaign of education of people who own dogs, in particular in rural areas.  <\/p><p> Some 25 years ago when I was growing up there was an advertisement on television in regard to dogs attacking sheep.  That advertisement disappeared from our screens a long time ago.  It was the first in a type of advertising that has since been used, in particular in respect of road safety and other matters.  From a television advertisement point of view little, if anything, is done nowadays to alert people, particularly in rural areas, to the responsibilities of dog ownership and the damage and destruction which uncontrolled dogs can do in rural areas.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to ensure the introduction of a new public advertisement and education programme alerting people living in or adjacent to the countryside who own dogs, and those wishing to take dogs from the pound and give them a new home, of the potential for danger in this regard and the consequences for them of not controlling their dogs.  It is unacceptable that dogs would be left uncontrolled resulting in havoc being wreaked on other animals, in particular sheep.<\/p><p> I welcome the legislation, which I support.  It is appropriate that after 101 years we are introducing updated legislation to deal with cruelty to animals.  I support what the Minister is endeavouring to achieve through the introduction of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000008#F00200","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348137000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and commend the Minister on introducing it.  This is important legislation from the point of view of animal health and welfare, the maintenance and increase of our food exports and the clean green image of Irish food products, thereby ensuring they can be sold on the international market resulting in significant progress being made in the production of Irish food for export.<\/p><p>  One of the aims of the legislation is to bring all animal health and welfare legislation under one umbrella, including the Cruelty to Animals Act 1911 and the Disease of Animals Act 1966, both of which have been amended extensively.  This Bill updates the terminology used in legislation in this area.  Not alone does it outlaw animal cruelty as provided for in the 1911 Act but it places a positive obligation on owners to care for their animals through proper feeding, the provision of suitable shelter, veterinary care and so on.  In the past the State could only intervene where a person failed to feed his or her animals to such an extent that the animal was malnourished to a level that clearly constituted cruelty and caused suffering.  Under new provisions provided for in this Bill the appropriate authorities will be able to issue animal health and welfare notices requiring animal keepers to feed animals, improve shelter, provide medicines and so on, which is to be welcomed.  The Bill provides that authorised personnel can take action in cases where animals are at risk so as to prevent suffering, which is important.<\/p><p>  The welfare requirements contained in the Bill are informed by the five freedoms set out by the Farm Animal Welfare Council.  These include freedom from hunger and thirst by way of ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease by prevention, diagnosis and treatment; freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress.  The Bill is important from a range of views, including, health, welfare and food exports.  <\/p><p>  The Bill updates our legislation in regard to animal fighting.  While up to now it has been difficult to secure convictions in respect of animal fighting this situation is remedied under section 15 which prohibits the organisation of or participation in any performance involving, for example, wrestling with animals, dog fighting, cock fighting, animal bating, throwing or casting of ropes, riding an animal which has been stimulated with the intention of making it buck, or any other activity that may cause unnecessary suffering to animals and is prohibited by the regulations.  The Bill also outlaws organisation of or attendance at this type of fighting, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  The Bill also deals with the issue of the sale of animals to minors, a matter that has given rise to serious concern in recent years.  The age in this regard has been raised from 12 to 16 years, which is welcome.  However, perhaps the Minister would take another look at the relevant section, which appears loose in its wording in that the obligation is placed on the vendor to satisfy himself or herself that the minor is over 16 years of age.<\/p><p> Another issue is that animals roam loose on public open spaces in many areas and that is not acceptable.  It is unhelpful to residents.  It should be prevented and where it occurs we should make it as easy as possible for those animals to be removed.  I ask the Minister to address in the legislation how we could be more effective in ensuring that animals are not allowed to roam loose on our public open spaces, particularly in housing estates.<\/p><p> There is also the question of the keeping and ownership of particular breeds of animals.  For instance, pit bulls are being kept and are not being properly looked after.  In some cases they are allowed to roam free in public areas.  There is a provision that they must be muzzled and kept on a lead but the observance of that is quite loose and is not properly followed up.  I ask the Minister to examine that area also.<\/p><p> The Bill is welcome.  It updates the legislation in this area and puts an onus on the owner to ensure the health and welfare of animals.  It is important legislation from a series of points of view.  I ask the Minister to confirm that the Bill will not adversely affect any properly organised or regulated greyhound and coursing industries.  That is an important consideration.  Those important industries are widespread throughout the country and generate considerable employment.  It does not appear that the provisions of the Bill would adversely affect these two industries but I would like the Minister to confirm that is the position.  I welcome this important legislation and I also welcome the Minister's comments on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000009#G00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348137600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I thank the Minister for initiating it and bringing animal welfare legislation into the 21st century.  As many Members on the Government side have spoken about agriculture and animal husbandry, I will concentrate slightly more on the domestic and companion element of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I am confident the Bill will provide a shift from merely outlawing cruelty to animals, as outlined in the Cruelty to Animals Act 1911, to placing a positive obligation on animal owners to maintain the welfare of any animal under their care.  It is hard to believe it has taken us this long and the involvement of several Ministers and that it is only now that legislation on this area is being brought into the 21st century, particularly as animals are so important on a small island like Ireland and we place such economic importance on them.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains many welcome provisions such as stiffer penalties for acts of cruelty and a hotline for reporting offences.  It rightly carries over the prohibition on cock fighting and badger baiting from the 1911 Act, which is the heinous act of setting roosters against each other to inflict pain and injury, as is the use of dogs to attack a badgers in badger baiting simply for the amusement of onlookers.  Illegal dog fighting thrives in a lax society and, unfortunately, this has certainly been the case in this country for the past number of years.  The laws have been so antiquated that it has rendered it difficult to prosecute offenders.  Our country has been tainted by the images that have been reported in the media in this regard.  It is a dangerous and despicable practice and I welcome the Minister's concentration on this issue, with the increase of penalties in this area.<\/p><p>  I draw the Minister's attention to the Smithfield horse market which takes place on an annual basis and has rightly been targeted by animal health activists and the Garda over the years.  Horse racing and trotting on city streets and roads is a form of cruelty and it is an image I unfortunately see on a regular basis in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  It also endangers pedestrians and other road users.  There is an element of cruelty involved and it is an area that should be kept under review.  I appeal to the public to engage in the public consultation process that is taking place around the Smithfield horse fair.<\/p><p>  The legislation also provides that the sale of an animal to a minor, that is, anybody under the age of 16, is prohibited.  I believe that age should be raised to 18.  In terms of people who have good intentions towards animals, when a child reaches the age of 16 their parents will be able to engage in that practice as well, but I believe the age should be raised to 18.  One of the basic tenets of animal rights is that animals should be free from abuse and be maintained in a humane way.  However, it still happens, and with the recession it is happening even more, that pets are bought as presents at Christmas, only to be abandoned weeks afterwards.<\/p><p>  The Animal Heaven Animal Rescue Centre in Kerry highlights the level of animal cruelty and neglect that still exists in Ireland.  The centre, founded by Suzanne Gibbons in 1991, is a rescue centre for all animals.  An average of more than 1,500 animals a year are rescued by the centre.  Due to the amount of unwanted pets and neglected animals, the centre relies heavily on donations.  It is difficult to accept in this day and age, in a developed country with so many highly educated people, that sometimes the treatment of animals is still so lax.  It is said that the measure of a society is how it treats its vulnerable but a measure of a society is also how it treats its animals, and I am not expressing a sentimental point of view or the perspective of animal rights people.  There are very moderate people who believe that animals have rights as well and that the contract between humans and animals is extremely important, even if one were only to consider it from a cold economic perspective.  How we treat our animals is also a measure of how intelligent, modern and educated is our society.  <\/p><p>  In that regard, I welcome the introduction of on-the-spot fines following inspections by authorised officers.  However, I would welcome clarification from the Minister on section 2 surrounding powers of enforcement, namely, those of authorised officers.  The Bill defines an &quot;authorised person&quot; as a member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or an officer of Customs and Excise.  Unfortunately, there is a level of ambiguity surrounding paragraph (c), which states that an authorised officer may be appointed by the Minister under section 37.  That section states that the Minister may appoint any person or group of persons as he &quot;considers appropriate to be authorised officers&quot;.  Will the Minister provide some clarity as to what type of person or class of persons he has in mind and how he intends to measure their appropriateness for the role, as it may be left open to varying degrees of interpretation in its current format? <\/p><p>  Section 23 deals with the humane destruction of animals where, in the opinion of an authorised officer or veterinary practitioner, &quot;an animal is fatally injured, an animal is so severely injured, diseased or in such pain or distress that, for the alleviation of its suffering it should be killed, to prevent further suffering ... or an animal is a danger to life and property&quot;.<\/p><p>In these limited circumstances, the animal may be put down in a manner that will inflict as little suffering as possible.  While I agree with the amendment, I request that the Minister take into consideration that it is not always possible to attain the services of a veterinary practitioner within a reasonable time.  It is important we are aware of the realities of what happens on the ground when a veterinary practitioner is unavailable and that it may not be necessarily in the interest of the animal's well being.<\/p><p> Ireland has fast become recognised for its contribution to the food sector.  I am delighted to see issues of food safety and security have been incorporated in this Bill in the effort of enhancing our already excellent reputation on a global level within this sector.  Agribusiness has become an area of significant growth and importance for our economy.  Therefore, it is vital that we do not submerge ourselves in bureaucracy while trying to implement controls for the protection and subsequent welfare of animals within our care.  I welcome the Minister's efforts in this regard.<\/p><p> It is imperative that we maintain our traditional approach to farming, which has so far contributed to our success on a national and international level.  We are an island of small to medium-sized farms that is successful in the production, management and growth of its exports - a far cry from the American corporate-controlled food industry with its large factory farms, which produces food that is unhealthy and environmentally harmful to animals and employees.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware of the very large abattoir closed down recently.  Dairy cattle that did not produce enough milk were sent to the abattoir, supposedly to be humanely killed.  However, the practices in the abattoir were despicable and the authorities saw fit to close it down completely.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on its introduction.  I ask the Minister to continue to review the legislation in the area of hare coursing.  This morning, I discovered that hares are at an endangered level.  I take the point that many people are employed and that it is of economic importance.  If the practice is to the detriment of a particular species, it must be well regulated and continually monitored.  What is the status of the Minister's report on fur farming in Ireland?  Does he intend to bring it before the House soon?<\/p><p> Perhaps I can make one suggestion to the Minister.  We should introduce education on how we look after animals and responsibility for animals at primary level.  This does not arise from a sentimental point of view; it demonstrates how good a society can be if it can look after animals well.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the research showing much improved levels of rehabilitation in prisoners when they have access to animals and pet ownership.  Our interaction with animals is very important.  I understand the economic point of view but, from a humane point of view, it is important to portray ourselves as a good society.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000010#H00200","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348138200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Bill has been introduced and the work that has gone into it.  It is long overdue and the existing legislation comes from another time.  It is inadequate for dealing with the emerging needs and demands of today.  It is progressive and good that animal health and welfare are being taken together.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is the first Minister to take real steps in decades to address fundamental animal welfare issues.  Other Bills have been passed but they were on specific matters.<\/p><p>  I will deal with the positive aspects before addressing the aspects lacking in the Bill.  It is good that the Bill firmly states the responsibility of owners of animals.  Animal welfare does not mean an absence of cruelty but promoting the welfare of the animal.  It is positive that failure to look into notices and conditions for animals will be an offence.  Considering the extent of international trade and the importance of knowing the source of animal products and the need for surveillance in respect of animal disease in imports, it is positive that these points are covered in the Bill.  It works both ways for our imports and exports.  Another positive point is that officers can inspect premises with animals and animal products and take samples.<\/p><p>  Another positive point is the appointment of authorised officers to enforce animal rights legislation.  It shows the Minister is taking animal rights seriously and that no one will be exempt from punishment for the cruel treatment of animals.  The notices will only be effective if the fines for breaches are significant enough and if there are further consequences for those who do not comply.  On-the-spot fines and penalties are great because they are more significant than going through the court process, which can drag on.  The code of practice is also positive.<\/p><p>  The Minister does not expect additional costs from the implementation of the Bill because of the significant numbers of staff working in the area.  The hope is that the Bill will enable their work to be done in a more comprehensive way.<\/p><p>  I am not sure I agree that the deliberate laying of poison which will endanger protected animals should be considered minor, with a lower fine.  One positive measure concerns the people who should not be allowed to have animals in their care.  Anyone found guilty of a serious animal welfare offence will be precluded from owning or working with animals in the future.  Persistent offenders will be caught.  We know this does not happen at the moment.<\/p><p>  I am ambivalent about the sale of animals to a young person under 16 years of age.  I know young people who have been very careful of their animals.  This can continue but it will be under the guidance of a parent or guardian.  There are too many cases of the Christmas or birthday present being a designer dog, which is then abandoned.  I acknowledge the work of animal sanctuaries and animal shelters doing phenomenal work.  Some young people and teenagers are committed to animals and I acknowledge the way in which dogs are used for those who are visually impaired and children with autism.<\/p><p>  This Bill is positive in respect of dogfighting because animal baiting is despicable.  I am not certain we can preclude coursing because, to me, coursing is animal baiting.  I am glad that dogfighting is included in the Bill because it should be completely done away with.  It is reprehensible that people deliberately breed and train dogs to fight and be vicious.  It is good that it will be illegal to attend a dogfight so that there will be repercussions for those involved in attending and organising one.  Section 16 gives emergency powers to authorised officers and vets who encounter animals in distress or suffering injuries requiring immediate destruction on humane grounds.  I was on Cape Clear while a whale was standard in Baltimore.  I saw the distress of people looking at it, never mind the distress of the whale.  The legislation will be beneficial in such cases.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work of the late Tony Gregory because animal welfare was high on his agenda.  He regretted that more had not been done in his lifetime.  In a Private Members' Bill in 1993, he made the point that all legislation concerning animals should have &quot;the welfare of the vulnerable and defenceless in nature's creation&quot;.  I acknowledge the work of Noel Browne, the former president Mary Robinson and the current President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, who all had concerns about animal welfare.<\/p><p>  The explanatory memorandum refers to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine &quot;providing a legislative basis for the protection of all animals be they farm animals, sport animals, pets or otherwise&quot;.  The Minister referred to protected animals being accorded greater protection than animals living in the wild and said all animals are protected in so far as cruel acts are forbidden.  Section 12 refers to cruelty being expressly forbidden, including any unnecessary suffering whether caused by direct physical abuse, recklessness or negligence.<\/p><p>I welcome that.<\/p><p> I now refer to where the legislation falls down.  My first point deals with badgers.  I accept that we are not fully free of bovine TB and that control measures are necessary but such measures could be carried out in a humane way, not through the most barbaric, gruesome and inhumane practice of catching badgers in a snare.  I have seen the snares; they belong to a medieval torture chamber and are not part of a modern, civilised society.  The trapping is cruel and when the badger is caught, it is a sitting target for the hunter to shoot it.  A consequence is that the young badgers are left to starve.  There are no badgers in the Isle of Man, yet there is bovine TB there.  Farmers who are against badger snaring say other measures could be used to combat TB, including strict movement controls, thorough cleansing of livestock buildings, good ventilation and double fencing on all boundaries.  There were some measures of note taken in England.  Movement controls, improved cattle testing and biosecurity saw a 15% reduction in bovine TB.  There are similar improvements in other countries where there is no badger killing.<\/p><p> The Minister has previously taken questions on this matter and I noted the replies he gave.  If one culls intensively for four years, there is a net TB reduction of 12% to 16%.  Therefore, 85% of the problem remains.  I hope that the legislation could lead to a vaccination strategy instead of using the very cruel and barbaric practice of badger snaring.  The Irish Wildlife Trust stated in a letter to The Irish Times this week that since culling began in Ireland many years ago, 90,000 badgers have been killed.  However, 80,000 of the badgers were healthy.  In Northern Ireland, badgers are tested in the field so that only those infected with TB are killed.<\/p><p> Let me refer to coursing.  I could read out a catalogue of instances of coursing cruelty but I will refer to just a few pertaining to various coursing meetings.  Over two days of coursing at one event, 16 hares were hit by dogs.  Nine were pinned and seven died of their injuries.  At another meeting, six hares were hit by muzzled dogs, six were injured and two were killed.  Over another two days, ten hares were hit, two were killed, two were injured and two died overnight.  At another meeting, 12 hares were hit by muzzled dogs, one was killed, four were injured and one was put down because of injuries.<\/p><p> There was an interesting case in Westmeath.  The ranger, in his report, states nine hares were hit on the first day of the meet.  Of these, one was tossed and rolled on the ground, another was tossed and mauled, and another was mauled on the ground by the two dogs and placed in a wooden box.  Another was hit about five times and mauled on the ground by the dogs.  In Limerick, 15 hares were hit by dogs.  The findings of the post-mortem stated, &quot;I presume it was internal injuries rather than muzzles coming off&quot;.  The ranger noted that the muzzles did not come off.  Muzzles, therefore, do not prevent cruelty to the animal.  At another meet five hares were hit.  No veterinarian was present but one was on call, yet the veterinarian completed a veterinary report despite not having been present.<\/p><p> At yet another meet, in County Kerry, where 12 hares were hit, three were killed, three died of natural causes and one was put down because of injury.  The ranger's report noted this was because of the weather conditions on the day.  There was very heavy rain on the Saturday night of the coursing which made the ground very heavy and soggy and this, in turn, made it difficult for the hares to run, resulting in 12 hares being caught.  The ranger should have called off that meeting because of the condition of the field.  The condition resulted in the hares being hit and killed and made it difficult for them to run, yet there is nothing in the licensing regulations about weather conditions.  The so-called humane practice of muzzling has not stopped the injuries and deaths.<\/p><p> We know what occurs before coursing meetings.  The club members go out collecting hares.  Sometimes they do so outside the bounds of their licence.  Netting involves supporters yelling and shouting to herd hares into a net and then into an enclosure.  This, again, is cruel to hares because they are solitary creatures.  The wild hare is released into the field where we know what happens.  Blooding with hares, rabbits and kittens is practised by people who own greyhounds.  While debating legislation before the recess, I discovered that hares can also be shot.  I do not know what the poor hare ever did to Irish society to be subjected to such cruel treatment.<\/p><p> Greyhounds are very gentle creatures.  They are being trained to hunt and to be something that is against their nature.  Greyhounds have suffered injuries because of their being muzzled.  I am not advocating the removal of the muzzles but I am saying that muzzles, which are supposed to be humane, are not humane for the hare or greyhound.  There are thriving greyhound industries in countries that have banned hare coursing.<\/p><p> Let me consider the use of animals in experiments.  These experiments cause severe and prolonged pain.  There is concern over the lack of bioethical input into the transposition process.  There have been improvements in breeding but more legislation is required in respect of the code of practice.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the work of BirdWatch Ireland, which states wild birds are vital indicators of environmental change.  Therefore, monitoring their population is very important, especially when some species are experiencing serious decline.  The breeding curlew is an example.  There is a need to ensure the protocol for reporting on species and numbers hunted, or bag returns, is adhered to.  Changes in hunting pressure need to be monitored.  There is a need to review the listed bird species which can be hunted in open season and the monitoring of the number and impact of the licences.<\/p><p> Let me refer to fur farming.  I have seen evidence of the manner in which animals are kept, breaching all animal welfare laws, even those we had before now.  The practice is similar to the medieval torture chamber represented by the badger traps.  A review group submitted a report some months ago but this is not being addressed in the Bill.  I hope separate legislation is being planned as a consequence.  I know there is employment in this area but believe it can be diversified to the satisfaction of people who want fur coats.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that feral cats are a problem, not just in the countryside but also in many urban areas and housing estates.  They comprise a growing problem but there is a humane method of dealing with them, namely, an emergency neutering campaign.  Many veterinarians are offering this service for free.  There are groups involved in raising awareness in this regard.<\/p><p> It is horrific to see animals, including dogs and cats, being dumped.  Last week, a cat and three kittens were dumped on Dollymount beach and people tried to rescue them.  The microchipping of all dogs would go a long way towards tracing owners who have completely disregarded their responsibilities.<\/p><p> There are alarming reports of plans to ship Irish horses to China.  This debate arose already in respect of greyhounds.  Why should we export live animals to a country that has a record of treating animals inhumanely?  I do not understand this.  Ignoring human rights abuses, we should note that China, as a country, is steeped in animal abuse.  Animal rights organisations can chronicle the abuse of horses, which is part of life in China.  China has horse fighting.  There is a need for legislation to ensure that live Irish animals will not be exported to countries with a record of ill treatment of animals.<\/p><p> There is a lack of formal regulations for monitoring institutions in receipt of State funding that deal with animals.  Accountability and transparency are vital in ensuring that animal welfare is adhered to.  This goes for animals in private and State-funded organisations.  The level of compliance with animal welfare legislation by institutions should be monitored by independent authorised animal welfare officers.  I refer to the Irish Coursing Club, the greyhound club and Horse Racing Ireland.  My predecessor, the late Tony Gregory, said the coursing club is a law unto itself and not fit to regulate anything involving animal welfare.<\/p><p> The new legislation does not address the lack of oversight of a number of State-funded organisations.  Perhaps there is a need for an independent body to which people can go if they have complaints about animal welfare standards in institutions.  At present, it is not possible to know the extent of animal cruelty or whether all practices involving animals are in accordance with the law in the organisations in question.  This is because there is no transparency.  Will the new authorised animal welfare officers have the authority to enter the premises to monitor animal activity, sport and recreation activities and animal experimentation?<\/p><p> The Arts Council gives funding to circuses.  What is the level of compliance with animal welfare standards among circuses?  Does this feature in the applications for Arts Council grants?  Are inspections carried out before grants are allocated?  Will the authorised officers have the authority to inspect circuses?  I acknowledge Fossett\u2019s Circus, which has eliminated animals from its circus.  The focus is entirely on human activities, such as acrobatics.<\/p><p> There is some debate over zoos.<\/p><p>Dublin Zoo has come a long way since the time when, as a child, I saw lions and tigers pacing up and down the length of a cage that was not as large as the area I am standing in now.  Dublin Zoo has done a great deal to try to include elements of their natural habitats.  While nothing beats leaving them in their natural habitats, zoos have done good work in preserving species that would have become extinct through poaching and so on.  The zoos have also done good work in promoting animal welfare.  When schools and youth groups visit Dublin Zoo, it does good work in building their awareness of animal welfare.<\/p><p> While the Bill has many positive aspects, it also has negative ones and the instances of animal cruelty that I mentioned must be addressed.  Other Deputies and I will seek amendments in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000011#J00200","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348139400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Chinese Delegation","time":1348139400,"count":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000013#L00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1348139400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann I wish to offer a c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte, a most sincere welcome, to a delegation from the Committee for Ethnic and Religious Affairs of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference led by His Excellency, Mr. Thien.

The programme for Government contained a commitment to strengthen legislation on animal welfare.  The Bill before the House fulfils that commitment.  It updates existing legislation, ensures the protection and welfare of animals and provides for stiffer penalties for offenders.<\/p><p>  Another major focus of the Bill is disease eradication, in which respect I welcome the Bill's robust measures. In particular, the Bill gives extra power to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of the eradication of existing and potential diseases, makes animal mutilation a specific offence and specifies standards relating to the slaughtering of animals.<\/p><p>  A number of important provisions in the Bill relate to the obligations imposed on farmers and other holders of animals to ensure their animals do not stray.  This requirement extends to ensuring that all buildings, fences and structures are maintained in a way that reduces the chances of diseases spreading.  These provisions must be properly communicated to farmers, especially as the relevant fines can extend up to \u20ac5,000.<\/p><p>  One particularly welcome aspect of the Bill is the power given to the authorities to take pre-emptive action where they suspect incidents of animal cruelty are about to take place.  Currently, the law prohibits cruelty to animals, but there is a gap when it comes to taking preventative action.  The Bill provides greater safeguards for what are termed &quot;protected animals&quot;.<\/p><p>  Some farmers will have concerns about the powers granted to authorised officers to inspect premises with animals or animal related products and take samples.  The Bill provides for greater powers to search a premises, but can only be used where there is a genuine risk of the spread of disease or where an offence has taken place.  We all remember only too well the foot and mouth outbreak in Ireland and the necessity for swift action to ensure the disease did not spread.  Thus, most farmers will see the necessity of such powers when there is an outbreak of disease.<\/p><p>  Much of the Bill's focus is on the prohibition of animal cruelty.  I welcome the fact that this prohibition applies to all animals, not just those defined as protected animals.  It prohibits general cruelty but also provides examples of cruelty, such as baiting, kicking, overworking and mutilation.  Apart from penalties imposed by the court, those found guilty of cruelty can also be ordered to contribute towards the cost of veterinary treatment and the care of the animal.<\/p><p>  Another of the Bill's elements that must be communicated properly to all animal owners is that the Bill places obligations not just on the person in possession or control of the animal but also on the owner of the animal if he or she is a different person.  The owner of an animal can be found guilty of an offence unless he or she can prove that he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure the animal was fed properly.<\/p><p>  Balance is an important element of any legislation and I am glad to note the Bill sets out detailed arrangements for compensation to apply where animals are slaughtered to control a specific disease outbreak.  This includes a process of expert valuation and arbitration to apply in law in a manner consistent with the Constitution and case law.<\/p><p>  Another particularly welcome provision is the extension of the prohibition on animal fighting to include dog fighting, cock fighting, animal baiting and any other activity that may cause suffering to an animal.<\/p><p>  The animal welfare notice is another facet of the legislation that must be welcomed, as it gives animal owners due notice that their animals may not be cared for properly, gives all involved time to comply with requirements, and in many cases should see the problems rectified to the satisfaction of all involved.<\/p><p>  Protecting animal health has knock-on consequences for human health.  Some 60% of infectious diseases in humans can be contracted from animals, whether wild or domestic, and 75% of emerging human diseases have their source in animals.  Thus, the control of animal disease is an important factor in protecting human health.<\/p><p>  Tackling animal cruelty in all its facets is at the heart of this legislation and is to be welcomed by all those who have an interest in correct animal husbandry.  Farmers and animal owners across the country will welcome the commonsensical provisions of this Bill, but it is important that proper steps be taken to make all owners and keepers of animals aware of the Bill's provisions and the penalties that result in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>  I wish to address three matters, one of which was raised by Deputy Ann Phelan, that being the culture surrounding dog fighting.  I doubt that many of the Deputies present would follow American football, but a famous American footballer was caught and prosecuted three years ago for setting up a dog fighting ring.  He was sent to prison and received many fines.  The greatest concern that resulted from the case was the fact that he took up dog fighting as a child, everyone around him participated and it became natural.  While they knew they were doing something wrong, it was simply a part of life.  Part of his penalty was to visit schools to tell children of the wrongs and ills of dog fighting.  Although we have penalties to punish anyone caught dog fighting, there needs to be an educational element to show it is not normal behaviour and that treating animals so cruelly is unnatural.<\/p><p>  Coming from a farming background, I wish to raise the issue of the control of TB.  That we seem to have brought Ireland's brucellosis problem under control in recent years is welcome, as is the decreasing incidence of TB.  In recent months, TB regulations have been tightened.  Will the Minister ensure common sense is applied as much as possible?  Given my background, I know only too well the financial and other hardships that can be caused if a herd of cattle contracts TB.  One's herd and year are disturbed.  Under the new regulations, it can even have knock-on effects on neighbours.  In the west, many farms are fragmented.  A farmer could have a field here and there and three or four neighbours.  If one or two of the farmer's animals come down with TB, the response should be contained to that farm alone.  Unless there is a genuine concern about an outbreak in the area, it is not right for a single farmer to lock up as many as ten other farmers.<\/p><p>  From the suckler perspective, farmers can only take weanlings to market at certain times of the year.  Although TB testing has become more accurate, concerns remain that farmers with supposedly diseased cattle will bring their animals to a factory for slaughter only to find that the animals never had TB.  While there will always be changes in medical research and it will approach the point of being an exact science, it is not exact now.  Where a farmer has one or two animals that have contracted TB or are considered high reactors, it is not proper that he or she has the potential to lock up neighbouring farmers as well.  At a time when farmers throughout the country are under great financial strain, it would be a pity if their ability to go to market would be upset for a number of weeks for retesting even though their farms were not diseased.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan covered another issue that the Minister might clarify for me.  In respect of animal cruelty, special provision will be given to garda\u00ed, Customs and Excise officials and animal welfare officers to enter farms.  Inspections are the bane of farmers' lives, although they occur for good reason.  For example, if they are receiving money from the Government or Europe, we want to ensure the money is well spent and that farmers are doing what they signed up to do.  I have no issue in this regard.  Rather, I am concerned about the potential for these people to walk onto farms and conduct inspections of farmers' activities at any time.  The majority of farmers are only interested in the best of animal husbandry.  From time to time, however, an animal will become sick or get injured in a shed.  It is a part of the farming life and the animal may need to be put down.  If so, the animal will be lying in a field or the corner of a shed for a number of hours because it cannot be put down by the farmer.  A person could walk onto the farm during that waiting period and view what has happened as cruelty to animals.  While I welcome the new role afforded the people in question, will they have an expertise in farming, will they understand what the farming business involves and will the local vet have any role?<\/p><p>It is important that these people, if they are to walk onto a farm, understand the practices and what the farmer is doing in order to put the farmer's mind at ease.  They should understand the business and ensure that before any prosecutions or procedures are put in train, we get a very clear picture of what has happened.  The last thing I would like to see is farmers who are doing their job being affected by an incident that could happen on any given day where it could be considered as cruelty to animals.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill before the House and commend the Minister on the work done on it.  Perhaps when he is wrapping up the discussion he could cover those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000013#L00700","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348140000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am also delighted to be able to speak today on this legislation.  I compliment the Minister on all the work done since he took his post, particularly with animal welfare and rural Irish life.  He has a keen interest and knowledge of everything happening in the agricultural industry.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to welcome this Bill, although I have slight concerns about some aspects.  They are not major concerns and I suppose they can be teased out with amendments and further discussion.  I welcome the increased penalties, both monetary and custodial.  These are important as it is a major issue, with people having different perspectives depending on whether they live in rural or urban areas.  Animal husbandry is very important, particularly in light of the Food Harvest 2020 process and recovery in our exports and economy.  The processing of animal products and their derivatives is vital to exports, and we have a good reputation abroad in this respect.  I know the Minister is doing his best to enhance this with trade missions, etc. to promote and enhance the reputation of the industry.<\/p><p>  The Chinese delegation has left the Chamber but a previous speaker mentioned horse exports to China.  I come from south Tipperary, which used to be the home of hurling but is not any more, unfortunately.  It is definitely the home of Ireland's equine industry, although the Acting Chairman, who is from Kildare, might take issue with that assertion.  We in the Golden Vale have a very proud industry in horse husbandry, breeding and racing.  Another Minister was involved in a trip overseas that concerned exporting valuable progeny in the horse industry.  We hope extending that process to China will be a success.  Anything that has happened in Coolmore and elsewhere has been successful, as we saw when Queen Elizabeth II chose to visit Coolmore.  Other dignitaries and foreign visitors have come to see what we have and what goes on there.<\/p><p>  I envy some of the people when I see the way animals are kept.  They are definitely living in better conditions than some constituents as they have expert minders and facilities.  The people working there love their trade, which is why people are queuing up to work in the industry throughout the country and beyond.  I have mentioned Coolmore and there is no fear that any horses from there or similar facilities would be subject to any kind of mistreatment.  It would be anathema to the industry.<\/p><p>  People from animal rights causes have debated with me on the radio, arguing that horse racing should be banned because it pits one animal against another.  I do not know where these people are coming from but this legislation is a very reasonable effort from this Minister and his officials to legislate fairly.  As noted by the last speaker, Deputy Connaughton, issues will occur in daily life.  Incidents occur on our roads and elsewhere but anyone reared with an understanding of a farm would know that all kinds of issues may come about.  We need only consider what happened in Hillsborough last week, which was an appalling tragedy.  We have seen too many of these in agriculture but they show human frailties that exist, even when dealing with gases that cannot be seen or smelt.  Animals may break loose and have accidents.  Bulls or other ordinary animals may cause accidents.<\/p><p>  It is not the safest profession in the world but we must be reasonable in our understanding of what it takes to breed animals, rear them and look after them.  There is no one better than 99.999% of farmers in doing this.  They are custodians of the land and animals, giving up their sleep and meal times to ensure animals are well looked after and fed.  We have seen this in times of flooding and other circumstances when farmers must go through all types of danger to ensure animals can be kept safe.  I understand some people have compromised their own safety significantly to ensure herds of animals are brought to safety.  We can also see this in urban society with pets, etc. that may be on the motorway or in some place they should not be.  Efforts are made by members of the public, garda\u00ed and others to come to the rescue, bring an animal to safety and return them to their flock, either in the wild or in a farming scenario.<\/p><p>  Reasonable efforts are being made to stop cruelty, which is an issue.  I have no truck with the people who in any shape or form wish to abuse animals.  Some speakers have referred to the issue of horses and buggies and horses in open spaces in housing estates.  There is also the issue of dogs.  I visited an estate recently to do a leaflet drop and I could not believe that in an area with approximately 50 houses, I met approximately 30 dogs.  Some of them were quite vicious animals, although some were restrained or behind a fence.  I knew from looking at the animals that they could jump the fence.  I have a nervous disposition towards dogs, although I like them and I have a number of sheepdogs.  There is no better company than a dog, which is often man's best friend.  Nevertheless, they can cause problems and dog wardens do a hard job.<\/p><p>  I am glad legislation is taking into account and considering the strengthening of powers to remove horses from certain locations.  We meet people who may say they have a different culture but are part of our indigenous society.  I am speaking about what would have been referred to as &quot;tinkers&quot; in the old days, the tinsmiths who would have made coal shuttles or a cr\u00faisc\u00edn for a householder in exchange for milk, sugar, butter or a bit of jam.  It was a wonderful practice and it is a pity it has disappeared.  We now refer to Travellers, whom I support.  They must be allowed to exist.  Nevertheless, they should come into the real world and exist alongside the culture of settled people.<\/p><p>  I have served on the housing committee in south Tipperary and worked very actively with Travellers, including women who have gone to work.  There must be an understanding that housing estates are not places for animals or racing jarveys.  The practice is not confined to Travellers either but it is a major problem in Clonmel.  I have suggested that the county council, which has a significant tract of land, should create a safe track to get this activity off the roads.<\/p><\/a><p>They continue to do it and it is a danger to themselves.  I see little kids riding them and it sends a shiver up my spine to see them holding on.  They race two abreast and hold up business and commerce as well as being a nuisance on the roads.  They should be brought into consultation to discuss creating tracks so if they want to continue to engage in this activity they can do so safely on a suitable surface.  I do not believe horses being raced down the road and pitted against each other on a tarmac or tarmac chip surface is fair to the animals.  It is a far cry from the plains of Kildare and the Curragh or any other race track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000014#M00200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348140600,"counter":208,"content":"<\/a> <p>It sounds like \"Ben Hur\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000015#N00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1348140600,"counter":209,"content":"<\/a> <p>To return to the Bill, the Minister and his officials have tried their best to look after animal husbandry and animal welfare without throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  I want to return to the coursing industry.  The coursing industry is very important to south Tipperary and other parts of the county also.  I have invited my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who spoke when contributing on previous legislation about shooting hares, to come to Clonmel.  I also invited Deputy Clare Daly who has refused to come.  I invited them to see coursing, not to look at the videos that have been made, but to see at first hand what happens during the coursing festival in Clonmel.  It is a very valuable industry which is worth \u20ac6 million to Clonmel.  It is not all about money and I do not argue we can be cruel to animals for the sake of the economy.  However, these industries are very valuable to the economy and use good practice.<\/p><p>  When I was a buachaill \u00f3g I went coursing every Sunday with the men and women of my parish.  It was a three parish coursing club and it was best education I ever received.  With the flora and fauna I learned about nature.  We hunted the hares and if we could beat or frighten them out, we had coursing.  It may not have been as humane as it should have been because the dogs were not muzzled at the time but nonetheless the coursing club did much for young people by instilling in them the values of nature and our heritage, the value of our open space, camaraderie, club membership and association.  It held many fundraisers and supported many charities.  It also held an annual social.  It no longer exists, unfortunately, but we still have our coursing festival which we want to protect.  I invite anybody to come, and if they want to picket it is a free society, but I ask them to come and see what goes on during the festival.<\/p><p>  Two years ago I was appalled when so-called &quot;animal rights&quot; people cut the wire and released the hares which were in fields waiting for the coursing.  They were not waiting of their own free will, but they were in fields and were not locked up in kennels.  The hares got onto the N8 motorway between Cashel and Cahir and were slaughtered by the traffic.  A so-called &quot;animal rights&quot; person went on the radio and stated it was more humane than being raced with muzzled dogs.  We must ask where is the logic and what is wrong.  It was an obnoxious situation.  The same person went on to state on the radio that cattle exports should be stopped and any animal such as my sheepdog rounding up hill sheep on the farm I partly own should be stopped.  What planet are these people on?<\/p><p>  I do not want to cast aspersions on the memory of the late Tony Gregory who was mentioned by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  He was an excellent representative.  If one lives in the Pale or any other town, one accepts the practices which go on outside the Pale.  Everything does not happen inside the Pale and people should get out and get a greater understanding.  I do not have an understanding of what goes on inside the Pale with regard to many issues, but I do not tell people what to do and what not to do and where to go and where not to go.  We must all live.<\/p><p>  My next point is not with regard to Deputy O'Sullivan but to another Deputy, Deputy Clare Daly, who spoke yesterday.  She professes to be a socialist who wants jobs.  However, we have industries which they want to destroy.  They do not provide too many jobs through the State but jobs are provided on family farms and by those in the country who keep greyhounds and provide the best facilities for them.  They nurture and love them.  They breed them.  They bring them to greyhound tracks and coursing festival and it is part of their culture and heritage.  By doing so they create an industry and give employment to thousands of people throughout the country.  I cannot imagine why people want to dismantle this.<\/p><p>  I will make another point, which perhaps I should not but I will.  I have already said to Deputy Daly's face that I cannot understand how people can be pro-abortion and anti-bloodsport.  It just does not fit into my little logic, and I may not have much of it.  Deputy Daly has introduced an abortion Bill and states she is committed to introducing anti-coursing Bills.  I cannot understand how the two can sit together.  It beggars belief.  It is not right or proper.  We profess to be pro-jobs and pro-work but we want to destroy industries such as coursing and horse racing.<\/p><p>  I am sick and tired of receiving e-mails and letters from so-called &quot;animal rights&quot; people.  I am in favour of animal rights and 99.9% of animal owners are in favour of animal rights and look after the animals better than any so-called self-professed &quot;animal rights&quot; lover would look after them because they understand what animals need to live and survive.  They understand what it costs to breed animals.  They are not the people who give pets at Christmas.  Too often I see pets given at Christmas being neglected and abandoned at huge cost to the State with pounds and veterinary bills.  They do not have a clue but ordinary people involved in animal husbandry look after those animals better than their own children.  They do this because it is their livelihood, their love and passion and their nature.  They want to look after animals and do so.<\/p><p>  This legislation must be fine tuned.  It is very difficult to legislate for many issues.  Deputy Connaughton spoke about practical farming and issues that can arise.  He has a serious concern, as do I, about the type of people who might get involved in policing the new legislation.  I have no problem with local authority vets and dog wardens but I do have a problem with self professed and maybe secret so-called &quot;animal welfare&quot; people perhaps ending up in these jobs.  They might end up there under false pretences or in open competition and they will have an agenda to persecute people and farmers for issues which may arise from time to time in normal farming practice.  I have serious concerns about this.  I compliment the animal rescue centres throughout the country which do great work.  Nothing is more distressing than to see animals being neglected.  No half-decent farmer would want to see any animal hurt or neglected and would go without themselves to ensure their animals are looked after.<\/p><p>  Legislation is being introduced with regard to the pig industry requiring more space for sows and litters and rightly so.  When we were young we all had a sow in the back yard and we did not have half the waste and had our bacon killed at Christmas.  We have lost many of these practices.  There is now a great deal of legislation on the keeping of hens and fowl.  One requires a herd number for a sow.  We must examine some of our legislation and undo it because we are destroying an industry and people's ability to be self-sufficient to a fair degree.  There was not much waste when people had a sow or two in the yard because the food waste was well looked after and one had a product afterwards.<\/p><p>  Since my previous contribution on animal welfare I have been asked by the Vegan Society to visit it and I will do so.<\/p><p>I will try to understand and educate myself better on their views and feelings and why they will not eat meat and other products.  However, the anti-coursing people have refused to come to see a civilised coursing meeting, to see the industry around it, to learn and to leave the Pale and see what goes on in the Golden Vale and elsewhere.  I abhor badger baiting and dog fighting and all those obnoxious practices which must be stamped out.  I am glad the Minister has addressed these issues in the Bill.  However, some practices have gone on since our Lord's time and the rabbit was killed and skinned when people had no other food.  We are now being told that is cruelty.<\/p><p> It is interesting this Bill is being debated in the House this week when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, announced the wording for the children's right referendum, on which I compliment her.  I look forward, I hope, to supporting it.<\/p><p> The Minister said that any involvement in dog fighting or animal baiting is despicable and should be completely done away with.  It is a significant problem and it is often hidden.  Some people breed or buy dogs solely for the purpose of fighting and it is an extremely cruel practice.  I compliment the Minister on the efforts he has made and will make and on putting more resources into dealing with that barbaric practice.<\/p><p> I refer to the issue of TB and brucellosis, which has cost the State billions of euro and about which I am concerned.  Like the previous speaker, I am concerned about neighbouring farms being locked up.  Scientifically, we do not know how TB and brucellosis are spread.  The fact that neighbouring farms and adjoining lands must be locked up and farmers cannot go to marts to sell their produce when they want is causing major hardship.  This year has been particularly difficult because of the lack of fodder.  Given the severe and adverse weather conditions since March, which was a lovely month, most of the surplus produce or silage been eaten, and this issue needs to be examined.  It is bad enough for the unfortunate farmer whose animals have TB, which he or she has not caused, and whose farm must be locked up, but neighbouring farms should not be penalised in this way because it does not eradicate TB.  I wonder why TB has not been eradicated after all the years and millions of euro spent.  I wonder is there something deeper going on and it is has become an industry in itself, which would be very serious.  However, we must not penalise neighbouring farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000015#N00300","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348141200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who contributed to the Second Stage debate and I look forward to what I know will be a very long Committee Stage.  A number of those who spoke in this debate are passionate about this issue and I want to try to take on board, where possible, their concerns.  However, I must also try to provide balance.  There is a series of conflicting views on what constitutes the right balance where activities such as hare coursing are concerned, and I will address this in some detail in a moment.<\/p><p>  The badger culling programme, which is part of the TB eradication programme, has been hugely successful over the past ten years in terms of the number of reactors in Ireland which has more than halved from more than 40,000 to approximately 18,500 this year.  That is a far more impressive record than anything that has happened in the UK or Northern Ireland.  We are doing something right but I would like to see a time when we can move away from having targeted culling of badgers to having a vaccination programme.  We are planning for that but we must also remain determined to eradicate TB.  Regardless of whether we like it, badgers carrying TB are a major contributory factor to the spread of the disease.<\/p><p>  I can send Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan a note on the detail around that culling, how it operates, the equipment we use for it, the independent assessment of the use of that equipment and the damage it does or does not do to badgers, because I know she is concerned about it.  I think she will be somewhat reassured by that, but some badger snaring is being done by non-departmental staff which is totally unacceptable.  I would not defend that for one second but I will defend the programme my Department runs, supervises and independently monitors in terms of the use of equipment to capture badgers in a way which maximises the humanity of that catching, the assessment of the badgers caught and their removal and appropriate disposal afterwards.  Nobody likes to see animals being put down and I can assure the Deputy this only happens in targeted areas where there is evidence to suggest that badgers are contributing to the spread of TB.<\/p><p>  This Bill is an enormous step forward for animal welfare and health in Ireland.  The primary legislation under which we operate dates back to 1911 and is outdated.  This Bill is concerned with making the shift from outlawing cruelty to animals to putting a new legislative infrastructure in place which ensures animal health and welfare is respected and protected in law.  That means people who have a responsibility for animals have a legal obligation under this legislation to look after those animals in a way that is acceptable in a modern country.  That is where the five freedoms, if one wants to use that reference point, are relevant and are the basis for this legislation.<\/p><p>  There are all manner of other positive spin-offs for the country in terms of the agrifood sector, our reputation and so on.  As a self-professed animal lover, I think that, morally, this is something we should be doing anyway.  It has been a long time in gestation.  The two officials with me have been working on this for a long time and have done a very good job in putting a very complex set of Acts into one piece of legislation and updating and modernising it where possible.  We need to make political judgment calls in regard to some of the more contentious areas such as hare coursing, fur farming, the treatment of feral cats and whether we should export animals from Ireland to other countries, to which I will refer.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to some of what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised because she has stayed to listen to the response.  I will deal with a lot of the other concerns on Committee Stage when Deputies are there to hear it.  The project in which I, Coolmore Stud and others are involved to help China to create and build a horseracing industry and all the standards that go with that is a very positive contribution to equine management and welfare in another state like China.  In fact, that project is developing in a very positive way and will involve selling in foal mares to China.  The sending of mares to Tianjin, north of Beijing, where the project is being put together, has been delayed because Coolmore Stud was not happy that the stabling conditions and the space were acceptable at this stage.  It has therefore deferred the sending over of those mares until it is absolutely happy it can stand over it.<\/p><p>  I reassure people that we are not in the business of expanding sectors at the expense of animals or their welfare or care - in fact, quite the opposite.  We want to export the best practice and know-how which we have developed in Ireland over the past 50 years and which have reached a global leading standard.<\/p><p>We want to export that expertise and some of our animals to help other countries develop the standards we expect.  I would take a tough line to prevent the export of Irish animals to any part of the world if I believed they were heading into an abusive situation but I genuinely do not think that is the case.  Those who are developing the industry in China and the many other countries to which we export horses are seeking to build the expertise and standards we have come to expect in welfare as well as quality breeding.<\/p><p> I have asked my Department for a review of the fur farming industry.  Ireland has a relatively small number of fur farms.  Whether I like something or not is irrelevant and the question is not one of simply outlawing fur farming, which some people would like us to do, but whether we should regulate to insist on best practice.  I will be making proposals on new regulations for fur farming which will involve random inspections and a set of standards that can allay some of the concerns people have expressed and although some maintain that the only to deal with the issue is to ban it I have made the judgment call not to pursue that option at this stage.  Banning fur farming would have the consequence of being required to compensate the industry to the tune of between \u20ac10 million and \u20ac12 million.  That is money that I simply do not have but even if I had it I am not sure the case has been made for shutting down the industry if it is properly regulated and if we can provide evidence that it is a form of farming like any other intensive production method.<\/p><p> I respect everybody's views on the issue of hare coursing.  I will not take the high moral ground on either side.  This is a sector which needs tight regulation but I do not consider it is appropriate to simply ban the practice because people are uncomfortable with it.  There are strongly held views on both sides of the argument and I am trying to find an acceptable balance.  If there is evidence that coursing is taking place in an appropriate way along the lines set out in the Bill we will take action, and the same goes for hunting.  However, it is not appropriate to simply outlaw hare coursing and hunting when they are pursued according the to the codes of conduct drawn up by clubs.  Considerable numbers of people are passionate about these pursuits and my job is to ensure that standards are met rather than simply outlawing practices.<\/p><p> In regard to neutering, Deputies will be glad to hear that despite all of last year's cutbacks we increased the funding available to animal welfare organisations.  A large number of people dedicate their lives to animal welfare organisations and rescue centres.  I happen to own a rescued dog.  These organisations and people deserve the State's support but they also need to operate to acceptable standards.  Sometimes people's enthusiasm and compassion results in their taking on a workload of animal care that they do not have the capacity to manage and that has led to other problems.  We have now linked the funding from my Department for animal welfare organisations with a requirement that they meet a code of practice and a standard of care built around the five freedoms for animals.  I consider this appropriate and hope other Members will support me on it.  <\/p><p> On the issue of authorised inspections, I would like to provide reassurance and information to the House.  Little, if anything, is changing from an agricultural point of view.  The people who inspect farms are officials from my Department who understand farming and all of its complexities and they will continue to be responsible for inspecting farms, speaking with farmers and imposing standards that allow us to take appropriate action against the rare farmer who is unwilling or unable to look after his or her animals.  We will go through the Bill's provisions in this area in detail on Committee Stage.  We are primarily speaking about departmental and local authority vets in this regard but further work and resources are needed in the area of caring for domestic animals.  There is a role for veterinary nurses, for example, if they want to volunteer to join panels of inspectors, and for proven animal welfare workers, whether from the ISPCA, the Dogs Trust Ireland or any other NGO that has proven its worth and can make a significant contribution in responding to the calls my Department receives on its freefone helpline from individuals who have comments or complaints about the abuse of animals.  <\/p><p> This is a strong Bill which takes a hard line against practices such as dog and cock fighting and badger baiting while trying to deal with tricky and difficult areas in which differences of opinion arise.  The views of those both inside the Pale and outside of it are equally legitimate and it is my job to find a balance that protects animals while at the same time understanding that certain sports in rural Ireland should have a future.  We have tried to reassure the lobby and representative groups of all those involved as best we can in preparing this legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a long and detailed Committee Stage debate in which I will try to accommodate people's concerns as much as is reasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000016#O00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348141800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1348141800,"count":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000017#P00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1348141800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><p>That the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 be referred to the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(a) and 126(1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000017#P00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348141800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1348141800,"count":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000017#P00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348141800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1348141800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Yesterday I referred to the UK case of Ian Huntley as an example of how a child abuser could remain under the radar for almost a decade.  His case is relevant to this legislation.  On the day of Huntley's conviction the then UK Home Secretary, David Blunkett, announced an inquiry into a vetting system which allowed Huntley to get a caretaker job at a school despite four separate complaints against him being brought to social services.<\/p><p>One of the pertinent issues surfaced almost immediately when the Humberside Police Force, in whose area the alleged offences had taken place, stated that they believed it was unlawful under UK data protection legislation to hold data regarding allegations that did not lead to a conviction.  This was contradicted by other UK police forces, which thought it was too strict an interpretation of the legislation.  There was also considerable concern about the police investigation into the murder by the Humberside Police Force.  It took two weeks before the police became aware of previous sexual allegations against Huntley.  Although he was the last person to see either of the two children, the story was not effectively checked out early in the investigation.<\/p><p> Another sad set of circumstances showing the need for robust procedures for vetting those working with children and vulnerable people surrounds the scandal in Irish swimming circles which came to light over a decade ago.  I mention this because the litany of abuse that occurred was horrific and involved more than one individual.  It included Mr. Derry O'Rourke, the coach for the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1992.  He was convicted on 27 sexual abuse charges against minors and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 1998.  He received a further sentence of ten years in 2005 for repeated rape and indecent assault of a female swimmer between the ages of 14 and 18.<\/p><p> All of this shows the need for a robust system of vetting, with accurate records that will ensure that police and social services can provide information if required and employers can verify that would be employees have no questionable histories that might jeopardise the wellbeing of children.  In this regard, employers should seek references from more than one previous employer.  A reference from one employer is not sufficient.  With vetting in place, people like Huntley and O'Rourke could never work again in positions where they might have access to children and vulnerable people.<\/p><p> In September 2008, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children recommended that the existing vetting procedures be put on a statutory basis.  The joint committee also recommended that legislation be introduced to regulate and control the manner in which records of criminal convictions and information can be stored and disclosed by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and other agencies for the purpose of child protection.  In that regard, I refer to some of the Fianna F\u00e1il criticisms of the Bill.  Despite the fact that it was recommended in 2008 that the amendment be made and the necessary legislation be published no later than December 2008, the Government did nothing about the matter for many years.  Their criticisms fall far short, when one considers what they did when they were in office.  The Bill provides that statutory footing.<\/p><p> The Bill also seeks to provide an appropriate balance between the need to disclose such information in the public interest and in the interest of protecting children and vulnerable adults and providing appropriate safeguards of the rights of persons who are the subject of such disclosures.<\/p><p> There will be criminal penalties for any employer who fails to screen potential employees to ensure the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  Where a person has been convicted by the courts or found to be a danger to children or vulnerable persons, a clear legal basis to ensure that potential employers will be made aware of the facts must be provided.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable persons and that they are protected to the fullest extent possible.  I look forward to playing my part as a legislator in protecting those members of society who ought to be protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000017#P00800","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348142400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  I sincerely and warmly welcome its publication.  It is extremely important legislation and, as the previous speaker said, it is long overdue.<\/p><p>  In the report given to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in February of this year and published during the summer, the author cited this legislation as being of critical importance.  The Bill will provide a legislative basis for the vetting of persons who seek positions in employment relating to children and vulnerable persons.  When we consider the publication of the wording of the constitutional amendment on children's rights it is appropriate that we welcome the debate on Second Stage.<\/p><p>  The Bill draws on recommendations from the Attorney General and the 2008 report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The Bill will make vetting compulsory for all employees or volunteers who work with children or vulnerable adults.  These will include registered social workers and people working for accredited adoption bodies and in care and welfare of residences, designated centres for older people, child care and pre-school services, special care, mental health and private security.  Later, I will deal with the area of child minders, which I feel should have been included but is not.<\/p><p>  The Bill will introduce criminal sanctions for those not properly using the vetting system.  In the interest of children's welfare, it is important that the Bill be implemented fully and that people who choose not to implement it face the full rigour of the law.<\/p><p>  Fianna F\u00e1il, and myself as party spokesperson on children, commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for building on the work done over the past 12 years on the welfare of children.  Some would have us think no work was done in this area in the last decade.  In 1999, the Children First guidelines were launched and a revised version of the guidelines was published in 2009.  The Child Care Acts 2001 and 2009 and the Adoption Act 2009 implemented key protection legislation.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children was established.  Information and accountability systems within the HSE were improved and 256 more social workers were provided as part of the Ryan report implementation plan.  That recruitment was exempt from the moratorium in place at the time.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs continues the good work of her predecessors.  We have had many long debates on child protection and welfare in the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the past 12 months.  The heads of the Children First Bill have been published and I look forward to it being debated in the Oireachtas.  A new agency, the child and family agency, is to be set up and will I hope commence in 2013.  I welcomed the agency when the blueprint for it was announced.  I have some reservations about its management structure and I will highlight them to the Minister as we come closer to its establishment, but overall I welcome the agency.<\/p><p>  The wording of the referendum on children's rights announced yesterday builds on the wording proposed by the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews, 18 months ago.<\/p><p>  Reservations have been expressed about the information to be covered in the vetting process.  There is reference to soft information, which is information that did not lead to a criminal prosecution, and it covers a range of organisations, from the Garda to the Teaching Council of Ireland, where this information can be collected.  This broadens the range of information used in assessing an individual to create a more accurate profile of the person.  However, the Irish Human Rights Commission has expressed concern about the balance between the privacy rights of the individual as well as the overriding legal imperative that one is innocent until proven guilty.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality replies to the debate he may outline his views on this issue.<\/p><p> I also highlight the use of PPS numbers.  I asked a parliamentary question if the use of PPS numbers had been considered in the vetting process and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform responded that in accordance with the provision of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, a PPS number cannot be used as an identifier in the Garda vetting process.  This could be contradicted in the current Bill, where section 13(5)(g) states a personal identification number, if available, should be submitted in an application.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would comment on that in his reply.<\/p><p> In 2007, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, a solicitor and child law expert, who now acts as the children's rapporteur to the Government, stated the type of information that is passed from the vetting unit to perspective service providers must be addressed.  He argued that soft information could add another important layer to the vetting process, giving the example of someone dismissed from work due to misconduct or inappropriate behaviour towards a child.  He suggested there was a need to clarify whether the Garda unit could process soft information and he would welcome a constitutional and legislative amendment to allow for that.  This child care expert stated that it is right to include soft information in the legislation as long ago as 2007, although the Irish Human Rights Commission has expressed concern.<\/p><p> It is notable that childminders are not included among the people covered by this legislation.  The introduction of the Children First Bill and this Bill presented the perfect opportunity to introduce a form of regulation for the child minding sector.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, however, has decided not to include childminders in the list of organisations and designated professionals in the heads of the Children First Bill or in this Bill.  The Government must commit to the inclusion of childminders in the legislation and in the upcoming Children First Bill.  We acknowledge and recognise this will require the introduction of regulation for the childminding sector, which will include the compulsory registration of all child minders with the HSE.  Only those who register and are vetted should be allowed to operate.  We will be tabling amendments to both these Bills on Committee Stage to ensure childminders are included.  Approximately 75,000 in Ireland are minded by childminders so there are many children who are being minded on a daily basis by people - I do not cast aspersions - who have not gone through the vetting process.  I have no doubt 99% would pass any vetting process with flying colours but we cannot be too careful.  This should be taken on board.<\/p><p> The legislation that has been introduced in recent years and the constitutional amendment we now seek to make will not on their own provide a robust child protection service  It is imperative that adequate funding be put in place to match these legislative changes and made available to the new family and child care agency that will be set up.  In the absence of adequate funding, all the legislative changes and changes to the Constitution are window dressing.  We must ensure the legislative changes are reinforced and matched with the adequate resources to ensure we have robust child protection services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000018#Q00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348143000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>With the announcement yesterday of the wording of and a date for the children's referendum and the introduction of this Bill at the same time, this week will go down as the time when children became visible, listened to, protected, cherished and valued in this State.  I welcome the progress made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform on these two fronts.<\/p><p> The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is welcome and overdue legislation and having called for it on many occasions I now very much welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  This Bill will provide a legal footing to those people working with children and vulnerable persons in our society and it will ensure that our young people are given the type of protection that sadly and regrettably has not always been the case in our society heretofore.<\/p><p>  This Bill gives the House the opportunity and responsibility to get the balance right on a statutory basis between the protection of children and vulnerable persons on the one hand and the right of all citizens to protect their good name on the other.  I welcome that all records of criminal convictions and soft information can be stored and disclosed by the Garda and other agencies for the purpose of child protection.  Equally, it is vital all citizens have the right to protect their good name and that information such as rumour, innuendo or false allegations will not form any part of the vetting process.  By and large, having studied the Bill, I believe the correct balance has been struck on these issues.<\/p><p>  There is a need for some exemptions from vetting, such as for private family arrangements for baby sitting and those who assist in a small way at sports or community events.  It is vital we are practical because otherwise the supervision, coaching and minding of children would be in so much of straitjacket that it would be unworkable and people would be put off training and coaching young athletes or teams.  That would ultimately work to the disadvantage of children.  As someone who has been involved in many community and sporting organisations over the years, it is important not to frighten off the volunteer who might be there to offer some assistance.  We need such people and so do our children.  That is what I mean when I say we must get the balance right, and this Bill does that.<\/p><p>  Another issue that the Minister referred to when introducing the Bill this week is the recommendation, which I would strongly support, although I was concerned when he said it might not be possible, that vetting should be transferable between different employer organisations to cut down on the multiple applications for vetting of the same individual.  At present, the organisation offering employment arranges vetting and if after a week the new employee leaves to do exactly similar work with another organisation, the whole process must start again.  I have seen in the past how this has led to huge delays and the clogging up of the system.  I hope a way could be found for vetting to be transferable between posts and organisations without in any way compromising the protection we all want to offer to our children and vulnerable adults.<\/p><p>  Concern has also been expressed about the inability to get information from other states about the criminal records of citizens who wish to seek work in this country.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality for his commitment to introduce a separate Bill to deal with this important matter.<\/p><p>Garda vetting for people involved in working with young people has been a mainstay of the voluntary sector for a number of years.  One of the problems, however, with the system in place is there is no statutory obligation for the declaration of information.  This Bill will correct that and the result should create a safer and healthier environment for all our young people.<\/p><p> Over the past few years, I had occasion to highlight the significant pressure under which the Garda vetting bureau has to carry out its duties.  In particular, I referred to delays in processing vetting applications and the domino effect that had on people taking up positions in voluntary bodies and organisations.  I know of people who were unable to accept positions as a result of these delays.  With the establishment of a bureau dedicated specifically to the role, such delays will, hopefully, be a thing of the past.  At no time in highlighting these delays did I question the validity or the necessity of the vetting system.  I pointed out at all times that no right thinking person could oppose such a measure.  My only concern was the time it took to process applications.<\/p><p> The Bill is important because it aims to protect those who are not in a position to protect themselves.  At a time the collective effort, energy and focus of the Government has been spent meeting the challenges of the economic crisis in our country, I am confident that in years to come future generations will reflect that we did not forget, neglect or take our eye off the ball with regard to the protection of children and young people.  Some things in life are more important than money and finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000019#R00200","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348143600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am proud to be a member of this Government, which is addressing the protection of children in a real and meaningful way, by introducing a suite of legislation, culminating in a referendum on the rights of children, to give the protection of the most innocent and vulnerable among us proper standing in Irish law.  This has been a long time coming and I thank God it is here at last, as the vulnerability of children and vulnerable persons has for too long been exploited not alone in this jurisdiction, but in jurisdictions all over the world.<\/p><p>  It is a signal of our maturity as a nation that we display an awareness of the permanent damage that can be inflicted on the individual, having the capacity to adversely affect their entire life and relationships, by one incident of abuse, either sexual or physical, and that we seek to address it.  Research has proven that these abuses are largely inflicted by someone known to the victim such as a family member, sports instructor, teacher, priest or health care provider.  These professions and many others are callings towards the good of society but we are all human and predators can be found among the best of people, as they seek out situations or opportunities to abuse.  The status quo can no longer prevail for this reason and we must face our responsibilities as legislators and bring the Bill into law.<\/p><p>  This Bill will expand on the existing vetting service operated by the Garda, giving it a statutory basis, making it compulsory for all employees or volunteers working with children or vulnerable persons to be vetted and, additionally, provide for the consideration of &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;specified information&quot; in the vetting process.  It will also serve to introduce procedural clarity and certainty into the process.  It goes beyond what is currently allowed, whereby only convictions are considered and it addresses the scenario where the competing rights of the individual and the public come into conflict.<\/p><p>  This is an area where we have the moral support of every right thinking member of society.  We have had the various reports, both religious and secular, and the people felt helpless.  They witnessed the harrowing stories and were ashamed at what had been allowed to occur in their midst.  They are all too aware that this great demon of abuse lives among us and I have no doubt this particular suite of legislation enjoys the goodwill and support of everyone who wants to fetter the access of these predators to their innocent victims.  No group of people on this island has an inclination to cause this legislation to fail.  If reservations exist, they lie on the side of ensuring the legislation comprehensibly achieves its objectives.<\/p><p>  I caution against the omission of those in employment from the vetting process for this reason.  Does any sector, profession or socio-economic group have a monopoly on abuse?  Just as none of us has a monopoly on the common cold, none of us has a monopoly on abuse.  Why, therefore, would we exclude the entire working population employed prior to the implementation of this legislation from the vetting process?  Does the fact that predators are in the system exclude them from the evil of perpetrating abuse?  We certainly do not have a system free from potential abusers nor does anybody working in the area involved believe that.  It is my fervent belief that everyone who has contact with the target group being afforded protection should be vetted.  This will create logistical problems but needs to be tackled.  Those in employment in the system, above all others, will be happy to ensure every avenue is explored to ensure the protection of the vulnerable for whom they care for in a good and wholesome way.  The legislation will be implemented.  Let us use it to provide a safer living and educational environment for the most innocent among us.  Let no group opt out of the system.  Those whom we seek to protect deserve a full and comprehensive vetting service - no buts, no exceptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000020#S00200","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1348143600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Sadly, as a society, we embraced wholeheartedly the adage, \"Children should be seen and not heard\".  We now know the impact of this school of thought.  It was detrimental to the well being of our children and vulnerable adults of all ages and abilities.  Not only did they suffer, but our society suffered the consequences of this neglect.<\/p><p>  Children become teenagers who become adults and negative experiences in our childhood and teenage years influence our emotional and physical development.  Too often, we hear of the harrowing stories of men and women whose horror filled childhoods stunted their emotional development, leaving them filled with anger or numbed by their experiences.  I will not go into the details the many reports produced, as they have been well documented, but I wish to acknowledge the work of the legal teams and, more important,the openness of the individuals who contributed, thereby holding up a mirror to us as a society.  What was reflected back at us was not nice to behold.  Anybody who cares about our society could not but act swiftly to ensure those experiences are minimised in the future.  Eliminating them would be ideal but, as previous speakers said, it will be difficult to eliminate predatory behaviour.  I would like our children, teenagers and vulnerable adults to have the opportunities they deserve to lead healthy and contented lives.<\/p><p>  The Bill is most welcome, as it finally transposes into law the procedures required to ensure those in responsible positions undergo vetting by the national vetting bureau.  I acknowledge the excellent work being carried out by the Garda vetting unit, which over the past year has significantly reduced the waiting time for clearance.  Additional resources, where possible, will continue to improve the service.  I agree that being allowed to carry a vetting certificate from one agency or place of work to another should be provided for but a realistic term of validation must be put in place to ensure the information available on the individual being vetted is up to date.  I am a little concerned about the lack of a requirement for individual child care providers to be vetted.  I acknowledge families must make their own choices about child care.  Some may use neighbours or family members they know well while others may use child care workers from different parts of the country or the world.  However, everyone who cares for a child should be vetted because, as we know to our cost, stranger danger is not as common a concept as we might think.  The provision for the Garda to use soft information is welcome.  People are living longer and they want to remain in the security and safety of their own homes, as do people with disabilities.  By vetting those who are entrusted to care for the people we cherish, we can be sure when our turn comes, we will be in the hands of people we can trust.<\/p><p>  The announcement of the long awaited date and wording of the children's rights referendum was most welcome.  Perhaps now, as a society, we can move forward having learned the lessons of the past, to ensure our children, teenagers and vulnerable adults enjoy their lives, whatever their abilities, and be enabled to enrich the lives of their families and our society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000020#S00300","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1348144200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>It is opportune, welcome and long overdue that children and their rights, health and well-being are central to legislation and that such legislation is now centre stage because for too long it was off the stage of anyone's attention.  When I spoke on the Cloyne report some time ago, I made the point that many nations have their dark moments.  For example, the Jewish nation has the Holocaust and Cambodia has its killing fields but in our case, it is the systematic abuse of young people.  I refer to abuse that was physical, sexual, intellectual, emotional and spiritual, carried out by those in authority, in the Church, in the State and within families.  It also was allowed to go on by those authorities who could have intervened and could have made a difference like the health authorities and the Garda.  A number of Bills are or have been before the House on this particular topic.  While the Bill under discussion at present is the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, I also refer to the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, the children's referendum Bill, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill and the mental capacity Bill.  The question is first whether all these Bills will ensure not simply adequate but thorough protection for children and second, whether there will be sufficient staff to cover all these measures.<\/p><p>  Members must take on board that most abuses occur within families or are perpetrated by someone close to the family.  Survivors of child sexual abuse and violence report that nearly 80% of them were abused by someone known to them, such as an immediate family member, a relation or a family friend.  A further 12% were abused by those in authority, such as a religious figure, a teacher or a coach, a further 3% by strangers and then 5% by others.  This means 92% of survivors of child sexual abuse and violence were abused by someone known and trusted by the family.  Consequently, the &quot;stranger danger&quot; approach being taught in schools does not reflect reality.  Children are told not to accept sweets, gifts or lifts from strangers but this is not a true reflection of the reality of child abuse.  In confirmation of this point, statistics from the Rape Crisis Centre indicate that in one particular year, 97% of those abused as a child and who sought help from the centre had been abused by a family member or friend of the family.  It would be difficult to convey in a school setting it is not simply about the stranger danger but also is about the danger within the family and balance is needed in this regard.<\/p><p>  The first point I wish to make is vetting is not the solution but simply is an additional tool for safeguarding children.  It is ironic that while those who put themselves forward to adopt children must go through a highly rigorous, intensive and necessary check that sometimes can go on for years, children can be left in abusive situations within their natural families.  I believe the forthcoming referendum will address this issue.  It is vital to tackle what is wrong and not to undo or to undermine the good that goes on in society and I note Deputy O'Mahony mentioned the work of the voluntary organisations.  It is important to emphasise the vast majority of teachers and those involved with voluntary youth work and in sports organisations, as well as the majority of families, have the welfare of young people at heart and would do absolutely nothing to jeopardise that.  They are equally as appalled and disgusted at what has happened in some families, institutions and organisations.<\/p><p>  Arising from the various reports, namely, the Ryan, Murphy, Cloyne and Ferns reports, the HIQA national standards for protection and welfare of children that came out in July and the independent review report on child deaths, Members have better knowledge of the extent of the vulnerability and mistreatment of children and vulnerable young people and it has been a litany of failures.  It is good this Bill has been welcomed broadly by most organisations dealing with children but the point is all these forthcoming legislative items must complement one another.  Moreover, it is all very well to state the national vetting bureau is being established but the question is whether the staffing and resources are available to ensure this will happen.  I make the point that with mandatory reporting and other demands, social workers are under serious pressure in their work.  Members do not seek to have these highly trained professionals spending all their time on bureaucratic work, administration and writing reports instead of being in direct contact with vulnerable people, who need so much more from those services.  Members are aware of the backlogs, of more than six months in some cases, which led to the Department employing additional staff on a temporary basis, including some under the JobBridge scheme.  As the legislation will place increased demands on the bureau, will it be able to cope?  I note longer delays mean difficulties for those organisations in need of staff, especially those in need of staff quickly.  The other danger, of course, is the quality of the work of the bureau could be jeopardised.<\/p><p>  I note the Bill does not reflect the urgency for clearance in situations where a child is in need of emergency accommodation with family members.  In the constituency I share with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, in particular communities that have been devastated by drugs and suicide, extended families, many of them grandparents, took on the care and rearing of the grandchildren when the parents died because of their addiction or whose addiction meant they were unable to care for those children.  Improvements have been made in the grandparents' ability to access the children's allowance and obviously, the response in this regard must be quicker because many such grandparents are living on State pensions solely.  Consequently, the interim measures that could have been used would have been to use the local knowledge available from the local school, community welfare officer, local community garda or youth club to ascertain that particular family's suitability to look after the children, that is, their grandchildren.  Moreover, it is important the children's voice would be heard, which is a highly welcome addition in the new Bill, and such a commonsense approach is required.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to a particular abuse situation for a couple of minutes and while it is in the past, abuse is never in the past for victims of abuse.  One group that has been protesting outside Leinster House comprises two gentlemen who were involved in swimming circles for many years.  I acknowledge the progress made by Swim Ireland in trying to ensure those horrific abuses at the hands of swimming coaches will never happen again.  However, they have happened in the past and the pain, anguish and suffering of those victims continue.  It is particularly difficult for those people who had great talent in swimming in the past and whose careers were cut short with the consequential lost potential, not to mention their lives and relationships.  Perpetrators still are coming to trial, including one some months ago, but one highly significant perpetrator has not been brought to justice.  A question must be asked, namely, who facilitated his entry into the United States.  I am appalled that two sports organisations in receipt of State funding are pursuing one of his victims for costs in a case.  Regardless of the settlement this person received, I find it appalling that these two organisations should so do, given it was their inactivity, laxness and disregard that led to the abuse in the past - they did not listen to those voices in swimming circles who tried to bring these abuses to the attention of the authorities at that time.  Those voices were ignored.  My sincere wish is this Bill will ensure that no child going to a sports club will ever be subjected to the abuse to which our swimmers were subjected in past years.  While it is too late for some of the swimmers concerned, who are now adults, the pain continues for those who were badly affected.<\/p><p>  The other group to which I wish to refer is the Magdalene survivors.  Members are aware of the abuse that went on and of the lack of care, consideration and everything in their lives.  It is very disappointing to learn that the report, which is in very good hands with Senator McAleese, will not be published for another few months.  It also is disappointing that it will not make recommendations.  Again, these women, who were severely abused by the State and by religious institutions, will not get the apology they seek.  I use the word &quot;compensation&quot; very loosely because no one can compensate for what they went through, but I refer simply to their entitlements now as older people.<\/p><p>  As for the concept of upholding the balance between the competing rights of the individual person to privacy and society, I welcome the argument made by the Minister.  It confirms the ability of someone to rehabilitate, if previously convicted of minor crimes unrelated to children.  Organisations should interpret vetting results on a case-by-case basis to allow people who have shown they are rehabilitated an opportunity to work in certain positions.  I note the HSE has a blanket ban on recruitment of anyone with a previous conviction, regardless of his or her crime.  The legal grounds for the employer must be clarified to protect both the right to rehabilitation and reform and the needs of society.  The data transfer of criminal convictions between Departments, agencies and State institutions still is not unified.  While the Constitution protects the right to privacy, the question is whether this can complicate the rights of the individual to reform and the rights of society to know.  This is the reason vetting is not the sole solution but is simply a tool.  I will turn to the soft information that also will be made available in vetting procedures, as the current legislation only provides the hard information in respect of courts and appeals.  Soft information will now include allegations of harm, neglect or any other information that might suggest someone could harm or cause harm or put a child or a vulnerable person at risk of being harmed, that is, anything that has not led to a criminal case.  I hope commonsense will prevail in this regard.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Human Rights Commission have concerns about people with minor convictions, some of them from years previously.<\/p><p>I hope such convictions will not be an obstacle to their employment.  The word \"allegation\" is used, and that must be handled very sensitively.  I know of adults against whom accusations were made and, following a lengthy process, those allegations were proven to be unfounded, which caused devastation.<\/p><p> There is an appeals mechanism upholding the balance between the rights of the individual and public safety.  The Bill references not just children but also vulnerable persons, including those with mental, physical and intellectual disabilities.  The provisions on re-vetting are positive.  However, the Minister has said this will only happen in the long term owing to lack of resources in the meantime.  It is an important part of protecting children and vulnerable persons as it provides updated information on the status of those working with children.<\/p><p> While I accept improvements have been made in homes for the elderly, it was horrific to read what went on in those institutions.  I know of people who were vetted for one organisation and that vetting did not carry over even a few months later, which puts unnecessary demands on vetting.<\/p><p> An area of concern is children in direct provision centres.  One third of residents in State accommodation for asylum seekers are children who are especially vulnerable because vetting is not part of the employment practice of direct provision providers.  This means children, women and people with mental health difficulties are living side by side, sometimes sharing toilets, accommodation space and dining areas with strangers from around the world, some of whom have had traumatic experiences from different countries.  There are obvious serious safety and overcrowding concerns in this respect.  That is where I see a limitation of the potential of the vetting process.  These vulnerable people in the system are dependent on good practice codes of direct provision providers.  We need further legislation to protect children in those vulnerable situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000021#T00100","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348144800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the impressive body of legislative work he has introduced since the beginning of the 31st D\u00e1il.  The statutory basis for existing procedures whereby a Garda record database is used to vet persons applying for employment working with children is very important.  At the moment 300,000 people per year are being vetted.  However, there is a need to speed this up because there have been many cases of people under pressure to get the vetting completed.  Perhaps this could be done through better training procedures but it is something that needs to be investigated.  It is a testament to the Government's commitment to protecting our children that a great deal of the focus of this week's proceedings has been on that.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on publishing the wording of the constitutional amendment on children's rights.  It will be an historically significant moment when this constitutional change is made and I will be delighted when that day arrives.<\/p><p>  When I studied the Bill, I found myself considering that this level of vetting would probably not be required in tight-knit rural communities such as the one in which I grew up.  However, I realised that was the wrong assumption because there have been many incidents in what we felt were very protected communities.  This is about challenging ourselves and challenging the way we feel.  Vetting is a reality and something that must be done.  The establishment of the database is vital and we need interagency co-operation if we are to provide effective protection.  I say effective because there is no point in having it there in name alone.  There have been too many dreadful cases in Ireland and elsewhere where the agencies involved were not communicating properly with each other and the consequences of that lack of communication were in many cases tragic.<\/p><p>  There are strong safeguards built into the legislation to ensure information will not be disclosed unnecessarily, thereby respecting the rights of the applicant.  There is a sense that it is a sad indictment of the times that we need these procedures, but the reality is that they were probably always needed.  We need to face up to the reality that there are people who harm children in our society, however dreadful that is.  Routinely, parents, including me, put their children in the care of other adults and we are expected to trust those adults.  It does not always start at the school gate.  In many cases it starts at our own gates when children go to school in school transport.  I have been unhappy about the situation for quite a long time.  School transport is being tendered for under a new better value scheme.  I feel that the primary care of children is not at its core.  Drivers, some of whom have been on particular routes for up to 26 years, have been replaced by people who are unknown and may be from the other end of the country.  The many years of good service and trust have been discarded for economic reasons, which is unacceptable because the most important thing in school transport is the children who are involved.<\/p><p>  In recent times the courts have experienced some difficulty in securing reliable and comprehensive criminal records or certificates from police forces in other jurisdictions.  We have had too many incidents of falsified driving licences, not to mention vetting.  This is an area that will need particular attention.  I am not trying to isolate any particular group but we need to be savvy and streetwise.  We cannot ignore the fact that this is a problem that needs to be considered in a very cold fashion.<\/p><p>  We are often asked to help out with children who might be in care and want to get a temporary work placement.  We would always be willing to help out with organisations which do such fabulous work with these children and vulnerable adults.  However, some employers may be reluctant to get involved in the vetting process and may choose not to co-operate.  This may mean that some vulnerable children and adults may not get the opportunity to get good experience in the workplace.<\/p><p>  I am glad this legislation has been welcomed by the Commission for Taxi Regulation as that industry has received some negative media reports in the past.  Vetting benefits not only the users of the service but also the service providers.  I know many people who employ young people under the age of 18, especially for summer work, and they will be subject to vetting.  We need to highlight this to the public because many people are so busy in their daily lives, they do not see the ins and outs of this legislation.  However, this is very practical and will affect them.  I encourage the Department to publish an easy-to-read summary of the Bill's provisions.  People want to abide by the law and do not want to fall foul of it.<\/p><p>  The definition of vulnerable people refers to people suffering from intellectual disability and people who might have a disorder of the mind.  In some cases these are minor and I am conscious that certain people who may be on a social scheme and getting help from the State might not regard themselves as being vulnerable persons, even though on paper they may be.<\/p><p>It is important that employers are aware of the need to vet employees who work with such people so as to ensure no one slips through the net and they do not find themselves on the wrong side of the law.  It is also important that vetting apply across the board, including of those people currently in employment rather than only those seeking work.  People should have nothing to fear if they have nothing to hide.<\/p><p> I favour the introduction of a card containing biometric data which would be continually updated thus ensuring people would not have to seek re-vetting.  While I acknowledge that there are personal rights involved in this regard, such a card could protect employers and employees.  However, that is a matter in respect of which we might find a solution in the future.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill, which is practical legislation that should have been put in place a long time ago.  It is testimony to the Minister and the Government who value children and want to protect them and put them at the heart of our Constitution, as will be done by way of the forthcoming children's rights referendum.  The Bill is well structured and thought out, and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000022#U00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348145400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The introduction of this Bill is a clear statement by the Government of the importance we place on safeguarding our children and vulnerable persons.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and his colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the work they are doing in strengthening our child protection laws and procedures.<\/p><p>  A number of significant reforms in the programme for change for children have already been introduced by the Government.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 has been introduced and the Children First Bill has been published.  More reforms in this area are planned.  Yesterday, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs published the wording for the 31st amendment of the Constitution which, if accepted by the people, will ensure the rights of children are copperfastened in our Constitution.  The draft adoption (amendment) Bill was also published yesterday.  These actions are in stark contrast to the Fianna Fail Party's record over the past ten years.  I note the absence from the Chamber this afternoon of Fianna F\u00e1il Members.  The Fianna F\u00e1il Party failed during its time in office to introduce promised legislation on vetting.  This failure continued even after the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children recommended in September 2008 that such legislation be published no later than December 2008.<\/p><p>  This Government is delivering on its commitment to put children first.  This Bill is an important element of its reforming agenda.  While vetting has been in place for the past number of years, it was not been done on a statutory basis.  This Bill changes that.  In making it mandatory for persons working with children or vulnerable persons to be vetted by the Garda, our child protection procedures are being further enhanced.  This Bill clearly defines the categories of people for whom vetting will be mandatory, details the categories of people excluded from the process, provides a system of offences for abuse of the system and introduces an appeals mechanism.  <\/p><p>  Currently, vetting in respect of 19,000 organisations in the country is carried out by the Garda vetting unit in Thurles.  I welcome that this unit will continue to be run and staffed by the Garda.  This is important.  I also welcome that it will now be clear as to the categories of people to whom mandatory vetting will apply.  Previous legislation did not set out clear guidelines and while vetting was, in essence, mandatory for employees working in certain sectors, much of this vetting was discretionary.  In practice, the majority of people working with children and vulnerable persons were vetted on the basis of a voluntary code.  This Bill now makes vetting mandatory, ensuring consistency across the board.<\/p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill and the Children First Bill outline the role of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the HSE with regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons.  This legislation does not give the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na any additional responsibilities.  It is up to an employer to determine whether a person is suitable for employment or volunteer work.  The Garda simply provide the information according to its records.  Employers then make a decision on receipt of the disclosed vetting as to whether a person poses a threat to the children or vulnerable persons under their care.  It is right and proper that any potential threat which a person may pose to a child is made known in advance of that person taking up employment working with children given that our overriding responsibility is the safety of our children and vulnerable persons.  For too long in this country, a wall of silence protected people who were a risk to children and vulnerable persons.  The Murphy and Ryan reports exposed the extent to which this veil of silence had contributed to further incidents of abuse of other children.  It is important that lessons are learned from the past and that we have in place a legislative framework to protect our children.<\/p><p>  I am happy that the Bill provides for an appeals process.  This is important in cases where a conviction recorded on a vetting is not a conviction for an offence which poses a threat to a child or vulnerable person.  For example, a constituent of mine was convicted of drink driving a number of years ago and had his licence endorsed.  While he has had a clean licence for four years or more, he is consistently refused a job as a bus driver because this conviction is disclosed on his vetting form.  He feels strongly that he has been stigmatised for life for one mistake in his past.  For insurance purposes, a person is not penalised if he or she has had a clean licence for five years or more.  This man makes the point that given that he has had a clean licence for a number of years and poses no direct threat to children, he should be given a second chance.  I thank the Minister for including an appeals mechanism in this Bill.  It is an issue I have previously brought to his attention.  I also suggested to him that an independent adjudicator should be appointed, to whom persons like my constituent could put their case.<\/p><p>  Section 18 outlines the appeal process.  I understand the Minister can appoint independent appeals officers and that the qualifying criteria for appointment is that the person be a solicitor or barrister with a minimum of seven years' professional experience.  Any decision made by the chief bureau officer can then be appealed within 14 days of the person being notified of the decision.  Provision is also made for an extension of this period where reasonable grounds exist.  As I have said earlier, it is up to the employer to determine whether the information received on a person's vetting form prohibits him or her from employing that person.  However, many people experience the same problem as my constituent in that once a conviction is made known on their form - I speaking in this regard of a conviction in respect of which no threat is posed to a child - they find it very difficult to get work.<\/p><p>  In its submission to the Minister following publication of the Bill, the Children's Rights Alliance stated that the Bill must balance the State's duty to protect children, through the operation of a comprehensive vetting system, with the personal rights of individuals.  In particular, it must respect the individual's constitutionally protected rights, including the right to a good name and the right to fair procedures.  The inclusion of the appeals process will facilitate people who feel that they have a genuine case to appeal to an independent arbitrator.  It will then be up to the arbitrator to determine whether the information provided by the central bureau is relevant.<\/p><p>  The passage of this Bill will place a further burden on the resources of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na's Thurles office.  The office is already under pressure and it can take a number of weeks to process a vetting application.  These delays put a lot of pressure on all concerned, particularly jobseekers.  I have been trying to assist a young man who was recently offered a job with a private health care company.  His prospective employer has applied for vetting and has been advised that it will be a number of weeks before this application will be processed.  This young man is very anxious.  While there will be no problem with his vetting, the delay is causing him a lot of stress.  He is concerned that as a result of the delay he could lose this job, which he was due to start a number of weeks ago.  I received another letter yesterday from the mother of a young man who is experiencing the same problem.  It is an issue.<\/p><p> I welcome that the Minister has moved to address the staff demands of the Galway vetting unit in an innovative and cost-effective way.  I understand that 15 clerical officers who were previously employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Ennis in my county of Clare have now been redeployed to a sub-office of the Garda vetting unit which has been set up in Ennis.  That is good news for all concerned, including the staff.  They have completed a training course and when the sub-office is fully functional, they will play an important role in assisting the Garda unit to reduce the processing time of applications.  I wish the staff, many of whom I know, well in their new role in this unit.  In addition to the redeployment of these staff, I also understand the Minister is in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure the Thurles office has been resourced to meet demand.<\/p><p> The legislation compares favourably with best international practice, which is important.  It has taken some time to put into place but it is important.  We need to get it right and the Minister has got it right on this occasion.  The introduction of mandatory vetting for all those who work with children and vulnerable persons is a welcome step in strengthening our child protection systems.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000023#V00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348146000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Deputy \u00d3 Snodaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000024#W00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1348146000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000024#W00300","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1348146000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Sinn F\u00e9in welcomes the proposed introduction of this Bill.  Unfortunately, as a State and society we are all too aware of our abysmal record in terms of the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  Therefore, any measures, especially legislative measures, which aim to safeguard and protect the above groups are very significant and important.<\/p><p>  The proposed legislation is an indication that, perhaps finally, the State is prepared to live up to its statutory, societal and legislative responsibility in this area.  By providing a statutory basis for the existing procedures whereby the Garda criminal records database is used to vet people working with children or young adults, this Bill should act as a deterrent against those who would seek to exploit and abuse vulnerable groups.<\/p><p>  As it stands, approximately 300,000 vetting applications are processed by the Garda vetting unit each year.  The Bill will make it mandatory for persons working with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted, whereas currently this is done on a voluntary code.<\/p><p>  In providing for the use of so-called soft information in such vetting, in other words, information other than a court determined criminal record, the Bill allows local knowledge to be marshalled in the interest of child safety.  However, while Sinn F\u00e9in welcomes and supports this legislation, it does so with the understanding that certain important safeguards will be provided for in the Bill.  Exceptionally in the interests of child protection, Sinn F\u00e9in will in this instance allow for the use of soft information.  However, the party feels strongly that any such measures must also ensure full human rights and data protection compliance.  Further to this, the rights to a good name and to a livelihood of the person being vetted must be balanced with the rights of the children to the highest standards of child protection.  The right to one's good name is covered by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and as such is part of Sinn F\u00e9in policy.  Moreover, this right contains within it the benefits of the presumption of innocence and protection of one's good name and livelihood.<\/p><p>  I reiterate that Sinn F\u00e9in welcomes and supports this Bill.  However, we do so under the assumption that how the Garda vetting unit gains, stores, reproduces and accesses soft information is subjected to clear safeguards, limits and controls, all of which must be monitored by an independent body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000024#W00400","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1348146000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>This is an important Bill and its introduction is welcome.  It was promised by the previous Government but that did not come to pass.  I welcome that it is now before us, that we will have a referendum which will enhance the rights of children in Ireland, and that as well as those rights being enhanced by this Bill, we will enhance the protection for children.  Therefore, the introduction of the Bill is welcome.  The concerns I have regarding parts of it would in no way cause me to oppose it because it is a welcome step forward.  The only concern I have is to ensure it would work well, and we will, obviously, tease out the detail of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages, but when we return to this legislation, perhaps in a number of years time, we could also address some of the concerns I will raise now.<\/p><p>  We have had a vetting scheme in place and it has worked well on occasion.  In the past year it seemed to work quite well in that, to my knowledge, there were not significant undue delays until recently, when there were problems again.  There have been significant delays before and people have lost jobs which were being held for them because they could not get their vetting procedure done in time.  That is one of the key challenges facing the Garda vetting bureau.  It deals with 300,000 applications a year, which is very large number, and they are not all applications in the area of child protection.  It also deals with immigration, citizenship applications and, I presume, visa and other such applications, and its faces a challenge in dealing with all those.  I urge the Minister not only to pass this legislation but to ensure this section within An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has the required resources to make certain there is no undue delay in the processing of applications.  Voluntary groups and volunteers apply for Garda vetting to participate in summer projects, be it GAA clubs, soccer clubs or other projects.  It is important to ensure first, that those people are not discouraged from doing so by an undue delay in the processing of their applications and, second, that they can take up the positions.<\/p><p>  I know of instances where some of the delay was the fault of the applicants concerned in that they did not know the regime in place where Garda vetting was required for those participating in summer projects.  Many of these people had worked on the same summer projects for many years but they could not take up their positions this year because in some cases they failed to apply on time and in other cases there was a delay in the processing of their applications.<\/p><p>  Another case involved youth workers who were friends of mine who had applied for positions and were moving from one child care facility to take a similar position in another county.  The facility had to hold the youth worker's job in the other county open for three months while awaiting the processing of the Garda vetting application, during which time there was no one in that position.  That happened two years ago, matters have moved on since then and I have praised the unit for speeding up the processing of applications.  If we are ensuring that many others will have to comply with Garda vetting, we need to ensure the current regime in place continues to operate and that there will be no delay in the processing of applications.<\/p><p>  A major change to the vetting procedure is that soft information, of which there is a huge range, can be used.  As soft information is not proven fact, there is a concern to ensure it is not used in the wrong way whereby people who are vexatious or who have had a clash with or are bullying someone would make a vexatious report and the person concerned would then suffer as a consequence.  While an appeals process is provided for in the Bill, by the time a decision is reached, the position applied for may have been filled, and even if the person is successful in the appeal, his or her name will have been besmirched in some way, even though the information may not be public.<\/p><p>There will be a black mark against, or a question mark over, those people in the eyes of the person for whom they were going to work.  There is a balancing act between the protection of children's rights and protection of the person.  I will always err on the rights of the child but it is a balancing act.  We have to protect people.<\/p><p> I know a person who applied to work with children and was refused permission.  He had worked with children for many years and the decision was based on a conviction 30 years previously.  The conviction was for exposing himself, which sounds terrible.  However, the garda charged him with that because the man challenged the charge.  He should have been convicted of urinating in a public street, which is not an offence that would block him from working with children.  An appeals process is welcome so that someone in such a situation can explain the circumstances of something that happened 30 years ago.  Hopefully, it will be dealt with in the new legislation, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.  Perhaps it will not obstruct someone who had worked enthusiastically with young people until the failure to get clearance.<\/p><p> Others will welcome the fact that these measures are being introduced.  Anyone who has worked with constituents and in the social work field will welcome the development.  At least soft information can now be fed in to the various systms so that we can know when there is a question over someone.  If the person is looking for a position, he or she may be challenged in terms of what he or she has done in the past.<\/p><p> Ireland has a bad history of protecting young people.  Predators have gone into sporting and cultural organisations with the intention of abusing children.  Now, Irish society is standing up and being honest about its history and putting in place protection for those unable to protect themselves.  Members are all adults and can stand up for their rights but this is a case of taking a step to ensure future generations will not suffer the same scale of abuse.  We have taken the steps to prevent those predators getting into swimming clubs, soccer clubs or Gaelic games clubs, where they have ready access to children.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be enhanced on Committee Stage to ensure the necessary protections are made so that soft information is used properly.  This should be in place in time to have effect if the forthcoming referendum is successful.  The Minister should ensure the vetting section of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has the resources to carry out its job as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000024#W00500","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348146600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with my colleague, Deputy Robert Dowds.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The Bill will work alongside legislation such as the Children First Bill and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information) Bill.  The Bill will be complimented by a new provision in the Constitution if the people decide to pass the children's rights referendum.  We published the wording of the referendum yesterday and it was good to see it broadly welcomed by all sectors.  It is a positive start to see such support and hopefully it will translate into a \"Yes\" vote on Saturday, 10 November.<\/p><p>  I will lead a team of canvassers and campaigners in County Meath.  I was asked to be the director of elections for the Labour Party campaign in Meath this morning.  I aim to make sure we put the case for the referendum to the Irish people and the people of Meath in order to get a strong &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  Such a vote will confirm the strong desire of the people to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  It is not good enough that our vetting procedures are done on a non-statutory basis.<\/p><p>  I noted some criticism in the newspapers by members of the Fianna F\u00e1il Party.  It is important to point out that Fianna F\u00e1il did nothing about this matter through its time in government.  Its members had over 14 years to act but they did nothing.  Fianna F\u00e1il promised to introduce legislation but nothing ever came of it.  The promise remained broken even after the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children recommended, in September 2008, that such legislation should be published no later than December of that year.  At the same time, there were countless reports outlining the State's abject failure to protect children.  Each report chronicled a history of pain and neglect.  No one on this side of the House wants such reports to be written in 40 years' time about a child's life in Ireland today.  That is why we mean to see action.<\/p><p>  The procedures we have today are not working.  A HIQA investigation found that 43% of staff working in elderly homes have not been vetted.  The Teaching Council stated that over 40,000 teachers registered with the council have not been vetted.  Garda vetting for HSE staff has only been mandatory since 2007.  We need to see improvements and the Bill will set up vetting procedures to be followed by all professions.  As much as possible, it will ensure children are only in contact with adults who have been confirmed as not being a threat to their welfare.  The Bill is another step in the right direction for child protection in Ireland and I wish the Minister well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000025#X00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1348146600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>N\u00edl mor\u00e1n le r\u00e1 agam ach t\u00e1 pointe t\u00e1bhactach amh\u00e1in agam.  I welcome the legislation.  Other speakers have referred to the reasons it is important.  It is vitally important to do everything we can to safeguard children and vulnerable adults in their dealings with different organisations.  As Deputy Hannigan alluded to, a national vetting system has been called for since 2004.  The legislation is long overdue and I thank the Government for introducing it.<\/p><p>  It should be possible for vetting reports to be transferred between organisations or stored in a central location and remain valid for a set period of time.  This will reduce the need for repeated vetting of people found to have no marks against them.  It will speed up the processing of vetting applications and allow people to take up jobs or start volunteering with organisations.  I want to ensure the administrative burden on voluntary organisations and people who want to volunteer is as low as possible, while protecting children and vulnerable adults.  The subject is close to the heart of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and it is important people are welcome as volunteers.  They should be able to start volunteering within a reasonable time while they are motivated and before their circumstances change.  We all know how important volunteering organisations are in this country.  The obvious example is the GAA.  No country has an organisation like it and it is one example of many around the country.<\/p><p> The issue of making vetting portable in some form was raised at the justice committee, but it has not made its way into the legislation.  This may be because the Minister is concerned that people could forge certificates, as he stated in response to a parliamentary question on 19 June 2012.  Forgery could be avoided by having, for instance, a central database of vetting reports, each of which would be valid for a few years before one had to be re-vetted.  During that period, an organisation could apply to check one's vetting record without vetting having to commence again from scratch.  I make these remarks partly because I am aware that our neighbour across the water has a vetting system whose procedures are, in part, extremely cumbersome.  Even when people move from one job to a similar one, the vetting procedure must start from scratch.  The faster the procedure is, the better, but speed is less important than getting things right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000025#X00300","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348147200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>It is often remarked by people that if we had such a law 30 years ago, it would have saved a lot of people from misery and harm.  How true that is when we consider the legislation before us.  When I hear the Opposition, including Fianna F\u00e1il, which was in power for 14 years, criticise this legislation, I recall that the Oireachtas joint committee responsible for the constitutional amendment on children recommended that legislation be published not later than September 2008.  This never took place.  Therefore, I welcome what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is doing.  If the structures proposed in this Bill had been in place since the foundation of the State more than 90 years ago, many whose lives were broken would have been saved from evil human predators.  So many people in the top social classes were allowed gainful employment as teachers, minders, doctors, carers and sport instructors.  Some of these very people engaged in horrible behaviour and wilfully abused vulnerable children and people with special needs.<\/p><p>  As the House is well aware, vetting procedures are already a requirement under the Children First national guidelines.  Approximately 300,000 vetting applications are processed by the Garda vetting unit each year.  This is an enormous number.  I have been aware of the many delays in processing these applications but believe the process has speeded up.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who has responded to vetting concerns by increasing the staff at the Garda vetting unit.  There are a total of 89 garda\u00ed and civilian personnel assigned to the unit, which provides its service to more than 18,000 organisations.  I encourage the Minister to ensure the new bureau will be sufficiently staffed to ensure there will be no undue delays in the processing of applications.  I urge the Government to be aware that jobs could be lost if there is to be a prolonged waiting period for clearance from the new national bureau.<\/p><p>  The primary purpose of the Bill is to put into law the procedures that have been developed to vet applications.  More important, the Bill makes it mandatory for persons working with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted.  At present, this is done on the basis of a voluntary code.  I have no doubt the current number of applications will probably increase by 40% to 50%, which is all the more reason to ensure there are sufficient personnel to run the bureau.  I welcome the fact this Bill will create offences and penalties for persons who fail to comply with the provisions, as set out, including employers.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the use of certain other information in regard to vetting, which is referred to as &quot;specified information&quot; in the Bill.  Specified information is information other than a court-determined criminal record.  I welcome the fact that information emanating from investigations by the Garda or, in particular, the HSE, which may not have been followed by a criminal conviction, can be used in the determination of whether one is suitable as a worker with children or vulnerable adults.  Similar conclusions arising from fitness-to-practice inquiries by statutory bodies, such as those conducted by the Irish Medical Council or Teaching Council, can also be considered by the bureau.<\/p><p>  Over the years, garda\u00ed investigated cases in which a victim made a case against a person but later withdrew it when he or she felt he or she could not countenance a court case.  In such circumstances, there may be genuine concern that a person without a criminal record poses a threat to children or a vulnerable person.  Some people may be concerned that disclosure in this regard is a step too far.  However, the legislation provides that where a member of the bureau staff considers there is specified information in regard to the applicant, it will be referred to the chief bureau officer for assessment as to whether the information should be disclosed.<\/p><p>  Section 15 sets out the procedures to be followed by the chief bureau officer in assessing specified information for the purpose of its inclusion in a vetting disclosure.  This includes a provision that the vetting subject must be provided with a summary of the information and must be informed of his or her right to make a written submission in regard to the information.  A subsequent decision to disclose the specified information requires the chief bureau officer to believe that the information in question is of such a nature as to give rise to a bona fide concern that the vetting subject may harm, attempt to harm or put at risk of harm a child or vulnerable person.  The chief bureau officer must also be satisfied that the disclosure is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances, and relevant to the position for which the person is applying.<\/p><p>  The Bill, in section 18, sets out in detail the manner of an appeal.  This is fair and one can appeal on a point of law to the High Court, whose determination is final and conclusive.<\/p><p>  I welcome section 20, which provides for the periodic re-vetting of persons previously vetted for their current position.  This will ensure we maintain the safety of our children and vulnerable adults and will not allow an accredited person to get away with what the authorities believe to be inappropriate behaviour in another part of the country.  A person will not be allowed to continue in his position without being checked periodically.<\/p><p>  The Schedule to the Bill lists in detail the types of jobs or activities that require vetting.  These include quite obvious positions, such as those in child care services, schools, residential services or accommodation for children or vulnerable persons, and other positions not as obvious, such as those involving the provision of leisure, sports or physical activities for children and the promotion of religious beliefs.<\/p><p>  This Bill is to be balanced and I am sure it will be widely supported across the House considering many of the recommendations were from the 2008 Oireachtas joint committee's interim report, which recommended that legislation be introduced to further share and control information and further protect our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000026#Y00200","speaker":"1082"},{"type":"speech","time":1348147200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is very important and was long sought by many Members.  I claim credit for raising this issue on the Order of Business for at least five years.  It is well known that the need for this legislation was heralded in 2008.  At that time, the then Government was advised to introduce it.  I acknowledge it was otherwise engaged but the legislation was of considerable importance.  Despite the current Government's being otherwise engaged at present, I congratulate it, including the Minister for Justice and Equality, on introducing the legislation now.  It is needed, and has been for some considerable time.<\/p><p>It will prove to be of major significance in the protection of children and vulnerable adults.<\/p><p> In the past 24 hours, the main Opposition party generated a debate in the House wherein it claimed that the state of the health service was solely due to the alleged tardiness of the Government and Minister for Health.  What that party's Deputies forgot during the debate was the degree to which they had contributed for many years to the demise of the service.  They had considerable opportunity to address the issues in question, yet failed to do so.  Not one of them had the guts to admit this in the House.<\/p><p> This important legislation was flagged as long as ten years ago after a number of high-profile cases brought into the public arena information to the effect that certain people had been allowed to work unsupervised with children and vulnerable adults.  This led to questions about the degree of protection children and vulnerable adults could expect.  That sexual and other abuses were committed for a long time without legislative intervention is something of which we should be ashamed.  The abuses could not have been perpetrated without someone knowing about them.  People were moved from position to position, sometimes over long periods, and committed numerous offences, but an attempt was never made to address the issue fundamentally.<\/p><p> From the information made public at the time, we know that there was a recurring pattern.  The perpetrator sought a position in close proximity to vulnerable people, who comprise a broad class.  For example, some impressionable young and old people were easily led into unfamiliar situations over which they had no control.  How often have we read the evidence of victims in these cases?  They explained how, through the gradual process known as grooming, they were led into situations in which they suddenly found themselves compromised and abused and had their futures destroyed thanks to the State's failure to recognise the necessity of protective legislation.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise that the Bill is not an attempt in any way to damage the character of genuine persons working in what is a vital service, namely, caring for others.  As with all legislation, this Bill is only as good as its interpretation and enforcement.  Everyone applying for a position cannot be held suspect.  Instead, the applicant must be of good character and have the right intentions.  The applicant cannot intend to defile the people for whom care will be provided.<\/p><p> The reality was far from this model.  It became important for perpetrators to work themselves into positions whereby they could gain the trust of organisations and individuals.  They would then use that trust to abuse unfortunate, innocent and vulnerable people.  It was an appalling situation that should never have happened.  People who were fully aware of it and did nothing were equally culpable.  Neither I nor the Acting Chairman know how their consciences let them sleep at night.  No Deputy can surmise what their thinking was.<\/p><p> Some cases involved children and young adults with special needs.  It is appalling that they fell victim to people with long track records of abusing young people.  The Bill has been introduced to address that problem and it is important that it be handled directly.  People's records should be carefully vetted, authenticated and truthful.  Any attempt to pervert the course of justice or to tamper with a file will be dealt with strictly, which is as it should be.<\/p><p> Let us review past events.  By virtue of a series of unfortunate events, perpetrators gained positions of trust and responsibility and were able to carry out heinous deeds against innocent victims.  The number of times this was allowed to happen is appalling.  We proclaim to be a caring society, yet there was little uproar.  Why was that the case?  We tend to disassociate ourselves from actions that are done in our name.  We must address this issue.  If a wrong is brought to our attention, that it went unchallenged previously is insufficient reason to allow it to continue.<\/p><p> The major lesson to take from this is the degree to which we are prepared to respond in future when similar abuses are brought to the attention of public authorities and public representatives, including Deputies.  Some Members of the House raised this matter previously and I hope they will continue to do so.  No reason exists for postponing action in such circumstances.<\/p><p> Someone always has responsibility.  The State, its agencies and private agencies that take unto themselves responsibility for caring for others have a duty of care.  Their responsibility does not end after the person appointed to the job goes home in the evening.  Their duty of care has consequences.  The State is liable in the event of no action being taken to address issues, as is only right.  Following the passage of the Bill victims will have a right to seek recompense from the State if there is a failure in the system.<\/p><p>The vetting of the individuals must be carried out, taking in those people working with children, young adults and vulnerable people.  The State will become liable by this process, which was lacking in the past.  That is as it should be, as who will protect the vulnerable if the State does not?  Who else has the responsibility?<\/p><p> In the past, we seemed to shuffle our feet with these kinds of issues, as we did with many matters.  We have suddenly looked back over recent years and realised we should have acted in a particular fashion before.  That may be true but why did we not act?  I can never understand such behaviour, and I do not know if anyone else in the House understands it.  There were some atrocious and appalling acts committed against unfortunate young people and adults, when it was well known that the perpetrators had a long history of similar activity.  In whatever aspect of our society that occurs, there is no excuse for it.  If there was no track history and it was a one-off incident, one could argue that the excuse could be that we did not know about the problem.  There is no excuse whatever for an issue that may arise when a child or vulnerable adult has been sexually or otherwise abused by unscrupulous people in a position of power and authority and who exercised that power in such a heinous manner.<\/p><p> I hope in future we will not have to revisit matters like this or the kind of incidents we read about and saw unfolding before us over the past ten years or more.  Ten years is a long time and much abuse took place in that period.  Much abuse took place even in one year.  We can have regard for some of the court cases of which we read over a number of years, detailing how some of these incidents took place over ten, 15 or 20 years.  It is an appalling reflection on our society that this could happen.  The Opposition may have had a reason for delaying the introduction of this legislation.  I believe it came down to competing demands, and although I am sure the reasons were genuine, there is no acceptable excuse.<\/p><p> I hope the legislation, when put in place, will address the issues that have caused concern for many people who have expressed a worry about the well-being of children and vulnerable adults in schools, churches and State or voluntary institutions.  I hope the legislation will be adequate to protect those people and that the vetting system put in place will be sufficiently strong to ensure no one can use the system to follow through on a desire to abuse people.  These people may have psychological problems that need to be attended to.  In the case of persons being refused authentication by the authorities, I hope there is an assurance that if these people go elsewhere and make an application for a similar post, there is no means to circumnavigate the system for their own objectives.<\/p><p> I welcome the legislation, which is much needed and long sought.  As someone who has promoted its introduction to the House over recent years, like many others in the House, including the Acting Chairman, I hope it will have the desired effect of once and for all setting into history the unfortunate series of events that have damned this country with regard to child abuse and a lack of adequate protection over a long number of years.  That culminated in the kinds of atrocities that we have heard or read about, and up to now we have not had the opportunity to act on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000026#Y00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348148400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I am also delighted to be able to make a contribution on this very important legislation.  I commend the Government on introducing the Bill and the officials for drafting it.  The process will not be easy but I hope there will be a good and fair discussion of the issues, as it behoves us all to ensure that none of those heinous crimes are ever perpetrated again.  It is difficult to say \"never\" for anything but it is reasonable to introduce a vetting system that is transparent, in-depth and thorough.  There will be no slipping through the net or similar failures to what have led to some of the most appalling cases, some of which have been referred to during the debate.  We will never know about some of these cases because of the clandestine way in which the issues may have been dealt with over the years.<\/p><p>  We have matured as a society over the past 20 years but there was a slowness in facing up to the problem and dealing with it adequately.  Vulnerable children may have been in care because of a disability or an inability of a family to take care of them.  Everyone believed these people were placed in trust but they found the trust placed in institutions was breached, with well-being violated.  There have been cases in the sporting area down to the people's private homes, and some awful cases have been highlighted.  I suppose it is easy to be wise in hindsight but I hope this new system will be rigorous and resistant to the serious and ingenious efforts of people with a certain failing that leads them to want to abuse or misuse another human being.<\/p><p>  History has taught us that many of these people use subtle means, moving in on people's space to befriend them.  These people can get into a position of trust to achieve easy prey, although that is probably a horrible term.  Even worse, they seem to cajole or otherwise wiggle their way into the trust of boards and employment agencies in institutions.<\/p><p>This is more serious and it will take much legislation to deal with it.  However, legislation can only do so much.  It is about enactment and enforcement and those in trust and in governance of these places who must be ever vigilant 24-7 to ensure those entrusted into their care by the State are safe and able to live out their lives as best as possible in safety above all else.  This is where I believe the legislation will help but what is important is its implementation and enactment.  Vetting was introduced in recent years but it is not foolproof.  To look at it simply and coldly, a local garda in a community knew everybody in the parish.  Now, vetting is done by a national bureau.  I am not criticising anybody working there but I question whether they are able to obtain accurate information.  If you want to know me come and live with me, so if we do not know the person or the family how can we know the background?<\/p><p> This is a double-edged sword because we must endeavour to have the knowledge and proper references but we must also safeguard this knowledge and not allow it in any way to be misused or abused.  The records of individuals, which I hope are accurate, cannot be used to damage anybody.  They cannot be used to undermine the good name or character of the person.  It is a very delicate issue both ways.<\/p><p> It is interesting that we are discussing the Bill as I have come from a briefing with the officials of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the proposed wording for the referendum on children's rights.  We have moved on and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on this.  I also compliment those who worked on it previously.  It has been difficult to get to this stage and I hope we will get the wording right and that it will be satisfactorily adopted by the people whom we represent.  I have not attended too many briefings but I thank all the officials in all Departments because I have found the briefings very helpful and much tedious work goes into them.  To do or not to do, that is the question.  How far do we go and what words and syllables should we use?  Our Constitution is a delicate matter and changes to it are serious.<\/p><p> The Bill is long overdue and will receive support from all sides of the House.  We can criticise previous Governments if we wish but none of us was quick enough to recognise what was going on.  None of us can throw stones because we will have heard stories and anecdotes in our constituencies and we should have had a more listening ear.  We should have had our antennae up much sooner and we should have ensured these things did not happen.<\/p><p> I have a concern about the Bill and I heard other Deputies referring to this also.  What do we do with the sizeable cohort of people who are already in situ without vetting?  They were never vetted because vetting did not take place.  I am not casting aspersions on any of them but how can we be sure some undesirable people have not got through the net and are in positions of trust and, if they are that way inclined, might abuse children or adults?  I suppose it is speaking about legislating retrospectively, but how can we ensure this deals with every person charged with the part-time or full-time safekeeping of vulnerable children and adults?  We must also consider this matter.  We cannot just close the door now; we must ensure safeguards exist for these people also.  I do not know how we can deal with it.  Yesterday, we spoke about penalty points on licenses.  It is a simple matter to understand and better train ourselves as motorists not to receive penalty points.  How can we out people in situations of trust who are not fit to be in such positions?<\/p><p> I welcome the efforts being made and add my support to them.  However, I would like to tease out the issues further to find out how we can deal with people who are in the system who should not be.  There are many good people in the system including foster and adoptive parents, social workers, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, and hard-working people in front-line services trying to deal with many delicate issues.  The Bill deals with ensuring new people coming into the system are vetted but how do we legislate for those already in the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000028#AA00200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348149000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu\u00edochas a thabhairt do na Teachta\u00ed go l\u00e9ir a labhair ar an mBille seo \u00f3 thosna\u00edomar \u00e1 phl\u00e9 anseo.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate and their support for this important legislation.  The Minister and I have noted the points that have been raised and the Minister looks forward to discussing and teasing out the various issues raised with the Deputies on Committee Stage.  I would, however, like to take this opportunity to make some preliminary responses in regard to a number of issues.<\/p><p>  Deputy Niall Collins raised the issue of babysitters and childminders being exempt from vetting.  In the discussions on Committee Stage this will need to be teased out.  We need to consider the fact that many private child minding arrangements exist whereby people employ neighbours' children, family members, in-laws or nannies in the child's own home.  There are also many formal and informal arrangements whereby people leave a child with a neighbour or a relative for child minding.  At present, under the statutory Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006, &quot;A person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers who have access to a child.&quot;  The Bill will also create the requirement that childminders or nannies employed with an agency must be vetted by that agency, as this would fall within the definition of &quot;employment&quot; covered by the Bill.  Any parent who wants to hire a childminder or nanny who is vetted can therefore do so through an agency.  However, I pose the question whether it is appropriate or feasible for the State to extend this requirement and effectively to prevent parents from making their own arrangements for the care of their children.  In preparing the Bill it was considered that this would be neither appropriate nor feasible.<\/p><p>  I also want to refer to the issue of making vetting disclosures portable between jobs so that, as in the example given by Deputy Pringle, a person vetted to be a GAA volunteer would not have to submit a separate vetting application to apply to be a nurse.  Similar points were made by a number of other Deputies.  As Deputy O'Donovan pointed out, once there is any time lapse between two applications for two different jobs, any convictions incurred after the first application would not be contained in the vetting disclosure.  There is therefore a very real danger posed to children or vulnerable persons by such an approach.  Separately, I would like to add that this issue is much broader than is encompassed by the Bill.  Portability of disclosures in the manner suggested would be contrary to the provisions of a broad range of existing Acts which require vetting at the time a person is being considered for appointment.  The Bill does, however, make provision for each vetting applicant to be given a unique ID number.<\/p><p>This will then be used where duplicate vetting applications are received over time in respect of individuals.  Instead of each application being treated as a new application, the previous vetting record will be used and any additional information that has arisen since the last application will be added to the disclosure.  This is expected to significantly speed up the processing of repeat applications concerning the same individual.<\/p><p> In regard to the issue of solo practitioners in the arts, an issue raised by Deputy Halligan, the Bill provides that these solo practitioners can submit vetting applications through the organisation engaging their services - for example, a school or community organisation - or through an umbrella organisation which represents them for the purpose of vetting.  CREATE Ireland represents persons in the arts for vetting purposes, but many vetting applications also come through schools, community organisations or colleges.  It should also be borne in mind that under the provisions of the Bill, persons in the arts providing once-off or occasional services to schools or community organisations will not require vetting.<\/p><p> Deputy Murphy made the comment that we should not consider it valid to have a vetting system based on self-disclosure.  This is a very important point.  It is the reason the Bill does not provide for self-employed persons to be responsible for their own vetting.  It is also the reason the Bill does not provide for persons to provide their own copy of a previous disclosure record to employers.  Under the system we have at present, disclosures are issued by the Garda direct to the organisation seeking vetting.<\/p><p> The discussion this week has suggested that organisations might exchange vetting disclosures.  The Bill does not make such a provision.  It is considered that organisations would not, in many cases, be willing to do this.  However, more importantly, under the provisions of the Data Protection Acts, personal data cannot be used for purposes that were not disclosed at the time that the data was obtained.  <\/p><p> The Data Protection Acts already apply to the collation of criminal records data by the vetting unit.  The Acts also apply to the collation of soft information in accordance the provisions of this Bill.  The Data Protection Commissioner, therefore, has an inspection and oversight role in regard to the use of both the criminal records database and the soft information database which will be established under this Bill. <\/p><p> I should add that the reason there is no provision for the use of PPS numbers in regard to vetting is also because of data protection considerations.  The use of PPS numbers in this way would be outside the scope of current legislation.  In any case, because the Bill provides for the use of passport numbers and mother's maiden names, in addition to the usual information regarding identity, the vetting unit is satisfied that the use of PPS numbers would not be necessary.<\/p><p> The Minister is in full agreement regarding the suggestion of online vetting.  Plans to introduce online vetting are in train with the national vetting unit.  The Bill has been drafted to facilitate this development.  <\/p><p> The Minister is very aware of the need to continue to ensure the bureau is satisfactorily resourced and the need for it to provide an efficient service.  As the Minister acknowledged in his opening speech, the number of staff in the unit decreased by 20 between March and May this year as temporary staff contracts came to an end.  This reduction in staff numbers has been partly offset by the redeployment of 15 clerical officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in May.  The Minister is engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure adequate staffing to meet the new demands in the Bill and he will continue to ensure that this issue is prioritised.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Healy's comments on re-vetting, I wish to advise the House that the intention is that re-vetting will commence once the retrospective vetting of teachers and health workers has been completed.  It is sensible not to prioritise re-vetting of persons already vetted until everybody who requires vetting has been vetted at least once.<\/p><p> The Minister and I look forward to having further detailed discussion of these and other aspects of the Bill with the Deputies on Committee stage.  As the Deputies will be aware, this Bill is an important part of a suite of legislation the Government is bringing forward in order to ensure that the rights of children and vulnerable persons are protected.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 has already been passed by the Oireachtas.  It makes it an offence for any person to fail to notify the Garda where a child or vulnerable person has been the victim of a serious offence.  The Children First Bill 2012 will further enhance the protection of children by ensuring the HSE is informed about children at risk. <\/p><p> The wording of the proposed children's rights amendment was published this week.  This will seek to enshrine in the Constitution key principles to protect children which will guide our legislation into the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000029#BB00200","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348149600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1348149600,"count":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000030#CC00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1348149600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I move:<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">That the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees<b>.<\/b><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000030#CC00400","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348149600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348149600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.06 p.m. and resumed at 3.42 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1348150200,"count":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the threatened loss of 30 jobs at Simpson Strong-Tie, Killorglin, County Kerry; (2) Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor - the need to revise the health professions admission test; (3) Deputy Pearse Doherty - the need to reinstate the children and adolescent mental health service at its outreach clinics in Dungloe, Killybegs, Ballybofey and Buncrana, County Donegal; (4) Deputy Clare Daly - the progress being made by the expert group established in relation to the A, B and C rulings; (5) Deputy Derek Keating - the problems in collecting social welfare payments at Lucan village, Dublin; (6) Deputy Robert Dowds - the designation of Glendalough, County Wicklow, as a World Heritage Site; (7) Deputy Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh - the delay in the payment of fuel allowances due to be paid in October; (8) Deputy Michael Healy-Rae - the regulations concerning mineral oil trader's licences; (9) Deputy Charles Flanagan - the extension of the eligibility period for workers on community employment schemes to three years, specifically in respect of those working in the Citizens Information Service; (10) Deputy Eoghan Murphy - the investment policies of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; (11) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - the need to address conditions at Rushbrooke national school, Cobh, County Cork; (12) Deputy Michelle Mulherin - the need to conduct a regulatory impact assessment before placing the burden for sick pay of employees on business; (13) Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan - the further delay in publishing the report into State involvement in the Magdalene laundries; (14) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - the position of teachers employed in VECs in view of new Teaching Council regulations; (15) Deputy Barry Cowen - the need to discuss the recent announcement of job losses in Bord Na M\u00f3na; (16) Deputy Dara Calleary - the need to create jobs in response to the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office on unemployment; (17) Deputy Mattie McGrath - the proposed changes to sick pay arrangements; and (18) Deputy Catherine Murphy - the delay in awarding back to education allowances.<\/p><p>  The matters raised by Deputies Mary Mitchell O'Connor, Dara Calleary, Robert Dowds and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1348150200,"count":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Professions Admission Test","time":1348150200,"count":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The health professionals admissions test, HPAT, is not doing what it is supposed to do.  It is designed to test the aptitude of potential medical students but it is not doing so in a fair and transparent manner.  Some 85% of those who repeat the HPAT secure a higher score on their second attempt.  I do not understand how this is possible.  The HPAT system is supposed to test for personality traits.  The core idea behind the test is to ensure that potential medical students have the aptitude and personality required to become top-notch doctors with suitably caring and empathetic personalities.  However, students who repeat the test do significantly better after taking preparatory courses.  These students do not magically receive personality transplants in the intervening; they learn how to beat the test and the system.<\/p><p>  The test was also introduced to increase the number of boys who enter medical schools.  It achieved its aim in its first year but girls are now outscoring boys again.  In the second part of the test, which focuses specifically on empathy, girls are outscoring boys.  It has also given an unfair advantage to those who can afford expensive preparatory and repeat courses.  It has simply become a revenue generator for course providers.  I concur with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors that the test is adding yet another financial barrier to students who hope to embark on a career in medicine.  One institute offering a HPAT preparation course charges a standard rate of \u20ac625 for a platinum package which supposedly includes two full days of quality preparation from an expert educator.  <\/p><p>  The recent report by the review team of experts in medical education indicates those who can afford expensive preparatory and repeat courses do 10% better on the test.  It is estimated that more than 50% of HPAT candidates take these expensive coaching courses.  Instead of broadening the type of doctors Ireland produces we are in danger of restricting the profession to those who come from the higher echelons of society.  It is wrong and unfair that a student who studies hard, makes sacrifices and gets 635 points in the leaving certificate examination cannot enroll in his or her course of choice, as happened this year.  Students with six A1s in relevant subjects such as biology, chemistry and physics cannot get into medical school but a student who has a C1 in biology may do so if he or she paid for a cramming course.<\/p><p>  Many students take up a college course in a related field while they are learning how to beat the test and leave the course after the first or second year once they successfully fool the HPAT.  In 2010, 111 students vacated another third level course in Ireland to accept a place in medical school.  This has financial repercussions for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00400","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for raising this matter.  The determination of selection criteria and processes for admission to medical schools is a matter for the universities and the medical schools in line with their statutory autonomy in academic affairs.  A new entry process for admission to medical schools was introduced in 2009 on foot of a recommendation of the Fottrell working group on undergraduate medical education and training.  The report of the Fottrell working group formed the basis for a programme of wide ranging reform and expansion of medical education and training in Ireland.  These reforms also provided for an increase in the number of undergraduate places from 305 to 485 and the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme with 240 places annually.<\/p><p>  The report recommended that leaving certificate results should no longer be the sole selection method for entry to medical education at undergraduate level and that a two stage mechanism should be applied consisting of the results obtained in leaving certificate and a standardised admissions test which would assess non-academic skills and attributes regarded as important for the practice of medicine.  The new entry mechanism, which was introduced by the medical schools in 2009, is based on a combination of leaving certificate results and performance in an independent admissions test, HPAT, designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills.<\/p><p>  At the outset the medical schools committed to a review of the new entry mechanism within three years of its introduction.  On foot of this commitment, a national research group evaluating revised entry and selection mechanisms to medicine was convened under the auspices of the council of deans of faculties of medical schools in Ireland in 2009.  The research group comprised representatives from the academic medical education staff of each medical school, university admission officers and the Central Applications Office.  Several international medical education experts have advised the group and continue to do so.<\/p><p>  The research group has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation to determine the educational impact, reliability, validity and stakeholder acceptability of the new entry and selection approach.  An interim report has recently been completed by the group and is due to be published on the websites of the medical schools in the next few days.  I have been advised that the findings of the report of the research group will now be considered by the academic councils in the five institutions concerned.  Approval of the academic councils would be required for any possible modifications to the operation of the admissions test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000031#DD00500","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I have listened to the Minister of State's contribution but I continue to question the validity of the HPAT.  I understand it has been recommended that students will only be allowed to sit the test once.  In the interest of students who are currently studying for the leaving certificate or are cramming to resit the test, I urge that a decision be made to allow them to resit the test.<\/p><p>  The test needs to be phased out or at least amended so that it is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the following actual example.  Three leaving certificate students all have higher mathematics in their top six subjects.  Not including extra mathematics points, student A achieves 525 points, student B achieves 550 points and student C achieves 600 points.  Adding the extra mathematics points, student A will have 550 points, student B will have 575 and student C will have 625 points, a perfect leaving certificate.  With the introduction of HPAT, every five points over 550 is worth one point.  Thus, student A achieves 550 points, student B has 555 and student C is reduced to 565 points.  The system reduces the gap between 525 and 625 points to 15 points.  This dismisses the months of work to achieve the difference between these two scores.<\/p><p> I urge greater transparency in our education system.  Project Maths skewed the leaving certificate results this year.  Some will say more students did honours and that 97% of them passed the paper.  If students attempted all sections of the honours paper this year they achieved 49% of the total mark.  In 2010, students who attempted all sections of the paper scored 38% of the overall mark.  In Scotland, for example, the pass rate for students aged 18 on the advanced level mathematics paper was 66%.  Ours was 97%.

They are incredibly stark. The total number of people unemployed, according to CSO measurements, is 308,500.  The long-term unemployment rate has increased from 7.7% to 8.8% over the year to the second quarter of 2012.  Long-term unemployment accounts for 59.9% of total unemployment in the second quarter.  That figure, in itself, is incredibly stark and it has been rising consistently for the last number of years.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister of State will outline a list of initiatives that people think are working and that we want to work.  I have been that soldier.  However, they are not working, as is illustrated by the CSO figures.  The long-term unemployment figures are particularly worrying.  These people are moving into a situation where they may become unemployable and suffer all the consequences of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>  Despite this, we have a skills shortage.  We have companies that cannot fill vacancies.  I pay tribute to the IDA and to the work it is doing and acknowledge the announcements made this week, but some IDA client companies are unable to fill vacancies.  We have a skills challenge as well as an unemployment challenge.  Surely, somewhere in Government system - I am not speaking about the political parties - someone needs to knock heads together and match up the skills shortage with the 308,500 people who are unemployed, 60% of whom are long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>  We are putting so much effort into getting a deal on bank debt and fiscal debt.  When the Government came to office the T\u00e1naiste moved the trade function to the Department of Foreign Affairs to beef up that Department and make it more commercial.  However, in Ireland and across Europe, governments are not putting a similar level of effort, fire power and imagination into resolving the unemployment problem.  We see the measures Ben Bernanke has announced in the United States, where the unemployment rate is 8%.  That is the kind of fire power we need on an EU-wide basis.<\/p><p>  Many of those who are unemployed come from a construction background, and the country still needs major capital investment.  Many of them could do with the old style conversion courses that were run back in the mid and late 1990s, although the course content may need to change.  That would allow people to move their skills over the course of a year or 18 months into technology or to where there are labour market vacancies.  We need a huge investment in that kind of course.<\/p><p>  If the message goes out to the multinational community that Ireland is a great place to invest but the jobs, when they are announced, cannot be filled, we will lose further jobs to places such as Singapore, to the BRIC countries and elsewhere.  Meanwhile, 308,500 people are looking for work.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State will read the list of jobs initiatives and funding for businesses.  I know the loan guarantee scheme is on the way and I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on that measure.  The opposition to it in the Department of Finance was intense but it was eventually brought over the line.  It is incredibly important.  Businesses and employers are crying out for capital investment from banks and they are not getting it.  The banks, the Government and various Departments come up with figures but all of us in the Chamber know it is not happening on the ground.  Very little new investment is happening.  Without new investment we will not create jobs.  I do not speak in any party political sense.  As an Oireachtas, we have a duty to the country to put this issue front and centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000032#EE00900","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the tenor in which he made his contribution.  I acknowledge that the latest quarterly national household survey, QNHS, figures show an increase in unemployment, but we never said recovery would be fast or easy.<\/p><p>The Government inherited a jobs market in free fall with more than 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before we took office.  That is not a political charge; it is a fact.<\/p><p> At the peak of the boom, almost 24% of GNP was attributable to construction, 12% of total employment.  The economy is in transition and since assuming office, we have delivered on the plan to build a new economy.  Part of this is supporting a transition from the old failed economy based on property, banking and debt to a new sustainable economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation.  The Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs, through the action plan for jobs, has direct identifiable targets that are addressed directly with the Taoiseach on a regular basis using that reporting mechanism.  Part of that process involves the small business advisory group, which includes all of stakeholders, such as ISME and IBEC.  They are part of the process of getting the recovery we so badly need.<\/p><p> Deputy Calleary mentioned the skills shortage.  There is a constant engagement with industry.  I met with Google the day before yesterday to see how we could get a further engagement with such companies on the STEM area and that will directly feed into how we address the skills shortage.  There are already programmes in play in terms of bridging courses but we must ensure there is a longer term policy goal that ensures we have a throughput of students from secondary into tertiary who are actively engaged in the STEM agenda, through courses such as Project Maths, so the right sort of software engineers and ICT graduates exist for the skills pool needed to sustain the economy in the longer term.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, as part of the necessary transition, jobs continue to be lost in construction, banking and the public sector as these sectors return to more realistic levels.  While the headline numbers out of work have risen in the latest returns, the CSO data show that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, there was a quarterly decrease of 3,700 in the number of persons unemployed in quarter two compared to quarter one, from 312,000 to 309,000.<\/p><p> We are in a period of transformation of the public sector as a necessary step to managing our public finances in a better way.  The number of employees in the public sector has declined by 25,800 or 6.3% in the year to June 2012 while the number of employees in the private sector decreased by 0.3% over the same period.

Her suggestion has been floating around for a while now that she will completely change that regime.

Let me talk, however, about the EU Presidency.  One of the central themes of the Irish EU Presidency will be job creation.  There will be statements on Ireland's position on getting Europe to engage on this agenda in due course.  The planning is ongoing and this week there was a Cabinet sub-committee on European Affairs where each of the Ministers and Ministers of State involved had an opportunity to discuss the EU Presidency and the core themes we want to ensure are at the forefront.  Job creation and growth with the European economy will form part of that.<\/p><p>  I take the Deputy's point on the public utterances of Ben Bernanke on the US Federal Reserve.  There is a different dynamic in the US because it operates on a federal basis.  There is a challenge for a member state like Ireland to ensure greater EU co-ordination but it is the Government's view that the role of job creation must be to the forefront of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  Horizon 2020 is a major pot of money, around \u20ac80 billion, that must be negotiated, along with the multiannual financial framework.  There are many Irish companies that will ultimately benefit from that once it is negotiated.  It will do more to inject further capital into the research and development arms of Irish companies and SMEs in particular to create those jobs that we want in the economy.  There is much to be done on the macroeconomic side.  I reiterate, however, that the action plan for jobs is a clear policy statement by the Government that involves all of the stakeholders, including small business, IBEC and so on.

During the Dark Ages, Ireland was a beacon of light in the context of learning, scholarship and civilisation when it was lacking in most other parts of Europe.  During that time, Saint Kevin founded a monastery in Glendalough.  I strongly urge the visiting delegation to visit the site, which is approximately 40 km south of Dublin.  They will not see anything like it anywhere else in the world.  Glendalough is home to the remains of an ancient Celtic Christian monastery and it is a unique site.  The island of Ireland only has three world heritage sites: Skellig Michael, Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne and Giant's Causeway.  Although Skellig Michael is an example of a Celtic monastery, it is quite different from Glendalough and it is partly because of this that Glendalough deserves this recognition.  The site was in its time one of the most important centres in Ireland both as a religious site and as a place of learning, trade, commerce and scholarship.<\/p><p>  I have been visiting the site for as long as I can remember but it was not until I travelled abroad that I realised what a unique place it is.  Its uniqueness is enhanced by its natural beauty.  Other major monasteries such as Clonmacnoise do not equate to Glendalough in the context of natural beauty.  While I am prepared to accept that Wicklow is the garden of Ireland, Glendalough is the jewel of the county and it is one of the jewels of the State.  To be inscribed on the world heritage site list, Glendalough must meet at least one of ten criteria that the World Heritage Council uses in determining such matters.  I am firmly of the belief that the site fulfils at least three of them comfortably.  It is an exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation, therefore, fulfilling the third criterion.  It is also an outstanding example of an architectural ensemble, which illustrates a significant stage in human history, therefore, fulfilling the fourth criterion.  It also directly related with events or living traditions, with beliefs and with artistic or literary works which are of outstanding universal significance, which fulfils the sixth criterion.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister for this reason to do all in his power to present the case to UNESCO for Glendalough to be made a world heritage site.  It would be a more outstanding site than many others abroad and it deserves such recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000034#GG00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1348152000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I assure Deputy Ferris that her interest has been taken on board and acknowledged, given that she represents the constituency.   I fully agree with Deputy Dowds that the monastic complex at Glendalough is one of the foremost national monuments in the country.  It attracts huge numbers of visitors to Wicklow.  The quality of its setting, together with its cultural and heritage significance, is instrumental in bringing many people to Ireland in the first place. It is a marvellous expression of the heritage and history of which Irish people are rightly proud.<\/p><p>  In March 2010 Ireland forwarded a new tentative list of world heritage sites to UNESCO on the basis of the recommendations of an expert advisory group established by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and of an extensive public consultation process.  The list contained seven new sites, including, as a single unit, the early medieval monastic sites at Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice.  Glendalough is rightly there because of its outstanding archaeological value, not to mention its great natural beauty.  It is one of the most visited sites in the country and is close to the Wicklow National Park.<\/p><p>  The site is protected as a national monument and it sits proudly in the company of the other early Christian monasteries included with it for consideration by UNESCO.  These sites have been chosen as a representative sample of the best of the early medieval monastic sites in Ireland whose outstanding universal value can be shown by any criteria one cares to mention.  They embody the culture of the early church and they played a crucial role in educational and artistic development throughout western Europe in the so-called Dark Ages.  They respond to the objectives promoted by UNESCO, in that they bear witness to a cultural tradition that has partly disappeared, as well as being outstanding examples of a particular type of monument.  The sites form part of a landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history and are tangibly associated with living traditions, ideas and beliefs.<\/p><p>  The importance of these monasteries as holy places, proto cities, places of trade and craftsmanship cannot be overestimated and I hope that they will become world heritage sites in the fullness of time.  It is an onerous task to progress applications for world heritage site inscription and it is not something my Department can achieve on its own.  While only the State can propose a site from the tentative list for inscription as a world heritage site, it is critical for local communities to become fully engaged in the process.  The impetus for developing a new application should come from the community itself, rather than from the top down.  An appreciation of the potential benefits to a community of having a world heritage site in its midst, along with an understanding of the obligations and measure that are necessary to protect its status, can best be gained through direct participation in the preparation of the application for inscription.<\/p><p>  Local authorities should also play a more proactive role. They have the resources and the expertise to assist local communities to focus their engagement and to provide the necessary leadership where appropriate.  This is in addition their more formal pre-existing role of ensuring county development plans and local area plans include policies and objectives to protect these sites.<\/p><p>  A positive development that will provide practical support for community participation in heritage initiatives, including world heritage, is the fact that new sources of funding are becoming available to community groups that are not accessible to State agencies.  Important changes to the regulations governing Leader funded projects have just been agreed between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Under the new rules, which I understand will be issued shortly, it will be possible for community groups to apply for Leader money for projects involving the development of historical or archaeological monuments for the benefit of the community itself or for world heritage status.<\/p><p>  I cannot overemphasise the importance of the role of local communities in protecting and promoting our heritage and in advancing nominations for inscription on the world heritage list.  The resources are being put in place to make this sort of community involvement a genuinely realistic proposition.  For our part, the Department will do all that we can to guide and assist the nominations process as expeditiously as we can.  I look forward to the Glendalough nomination making progress through this route and eventually to full world heritage status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000034#GG00300","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1348152000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris, as the local representative, will contact the heritage officer of Wicklow County Council with a view to taking on board some of the suggestions made by the Minister of State.

I understand that thousands of families who are dependent on social welfare benefits received a letter last month, of which I have a copy to hand, informing them that due to a departmental error last April, they will not receive their fuel allowance payments for the week commencing on 8 October, that is, they will receive it a week later than everyone else who qualifies.  This is not the Minister of State's brief and it is a pity the Minister responsible is not present because she appears to be determined to leave people in the cold.  I will set out the context.  As the fuel allowance is a means-tested payment, the Minister of State will understand the number of people who depend on it in rural areas in particular but also here in the city, where there is substandard housing that is cold, miserable and damp much of the time.  Moreover, for quite a number of years we appear to have been breaking all records for dampness and cold.<\/p><p>  Following the election, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, cut the fuel allowance for people in smokeless zone areas by 16% from \u20ac23.90 to \u20ac20.  At the same time, she also cut the fuel components of the household benefits package and the Minister of State will have been lobbied in this regard.  Electricity and gas allowances were cut by 25% and 20%, respectively, and while such cuts were the brainchild of the outgoing Fianna F\u00e1il Administration, the present Government implemented them.  As I noted, fuel allowance is means-tested but the Minister did not think she had gone far enough.  She then introduced a reduction in the fuel allowance season by six full weeks, which represents a cut of \u20ac120.  This might not be much to the Minister of State or to me but this is a huge cut to a pensioner who lives in poverty - the fact they are in receipt of fuel allowance means they have been means tested as living in poverty.  Altogether, the Minister already has cut fuel allowance to the people who have received the aforementioned letter by 35%.  This is a huge amount of money when one considers these people do not have the disposable income to make up the shortfall.  Moreover, the Commission for Energy Regulation has also just approved a hike in the cost of electricity and gas, which comes on top of all the cuts the Minister has introduced.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Social Protection in particular to reverse this cut.  She should indicate to the Department that this cut in fuel allowance will not proceed.  It is a mistake and the figures available to me indicate this will affect up to 60,000 people.  The Minister of State should confirm the number of social welfare recipients who have received a letter similar to the one I have to hand, which indicates it was the Department that made the error.  It has taken it this length of time to issue a letter to those people in receipt of the allowance.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate that the Government will reverse this cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000035#HH00900","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1348152600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  The national fuel scheme is intended to help households that depend on long-term social welfare benefits and are unable to provide fully for their own heating needs.  The estimated provision for 2012 is \u20ac214.3 million.  At the end of the fuel season last April, in excess of 400,000 customers were in receipt of the fuel allowance.  It is important to note that all recipients of the fuel allowance will receive their correct number of payments during the 2012 calendar year, that is, for 26 weeks, and consequently no customer has been short-changed.  However, an error in the timeframe for delivery did occur and I will now set out the details.<\/p><p>  In budget 2012, the number of weeks in which the fuel allowance is payable was reduced from 32 to 26 weeks.  Under these arrangements, the fuel season for 2011-12 was due to end in early April.  However, due to an inadvertent error in the application of the changes to the cohort of customers paid from the Department's ISTS system, the original fuel season termination date remained in place for approximately 60,000 jobseeker customers for one week longer and a further payment issued in the week ending 6 April 2012.  This resulted in an overpayment of \u20ac20 per client at an overall cost to the Exchequer of approximately \u20ac1.2 million.  Under Government accounting procedures, the Department is obliged to recover all overpayments, in so far as is possible and feasible to so do, and of course the customer has had the additional benefit in this instance of the additional week's payment.  The Department is doing this by delaying the commencement of the fuel payment season for those affected customers who still are in receipt of welfare payments by one week.  For those customers who no longer are in receipt of scheme payments, this overpayment will be recorded against their account and in the event that in the future they again are in receipt of payments from the Department, the matter will be addressed with them at that point.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the Minister, I apologise for this error, which is unfortunate.  As stated however, it is important that it is explained to customers that all recipients of the free fuel allowance will receive the correct number of payments during 2012, that is, for 26 weeks, and no customer has been at a loss.  I note some have been overpaid in that they received an additional week early on.  While I accept the situation is not ideal for those customers affected, the manner of recovery proposed is considered to be the one that will have least impact on the customer.  The systems have been reviewed fully in the Department and measures taken to try to ensure there will be no recurrence of this type of difficulty in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000035#HH01000","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1348152600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but as I noted earlier, it is a pity the Minister herself is not present.  It is an appalling answer to state the Government accepts the situation is not ideal.  The poorest people will not receive a payment fuel allowance on the correct date.  It is getting colder and this is about pensioners who do not have the additional \u20ac20 that was paid to them.  The allowance already has been cut because the Government cut back on the fuel allowance allocation in last year's budget by six weeks.  I note that 120,000 gas and 83,000 electricity customers are in arrears.<\/p><p>That is the scale of fuel poverty and people's inability to pay.  In addition, people would have planned on having that \u20ac20 from 1 October to pay for fuel.  An increasing number of people are dependent on social welfare.  They are the poorest in our society and this punishes them.  The constituents who have contacted me will tell the Minister of State exactly where to shove his apology.

He sends his apologies.  As Minister of State in the Department of Defence, I am taking questions on his behalf.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to maintaining the capacity and capability of the Defence Forces to undertake the roles assigned by Government within an establishment of 9,500 serving personnel.  Against that background, the Minister tasked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to bring forward proposals for a reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  Those proposals recommended that the Army component of the Defence Forces be reduced from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  A three brigade structure, which had originally been designed for a force of 11,500, could not be sustained in the context of maintaining numbers at 9,500 without impacting on the capacity of the Defence Forces to deliver the services required by Government.  The Minister, having considered the matter in detail, accepted the proposals of the Secretary General and the chief of staff for the reorganisation of the Army into a two brigade structure.  A reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service within their reduced strengths as set out in the employment-control framework is also being finalised as part of the reorganisation.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the current reorganisation is being overseen by a high level implementation group comprising senior civil and military management of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  The group has been meeting weekly since the announcement of the reorganisation.  They are planning the detailed implementation of the reorganisation in a manner which best addresses the future organisational needs and capability requirements of the Defence Forces while facilitating as far as possible the circumstances and expressed preferences of individual members.  The representative associations in the Defence Forces, RACO and PDFORRA have been closely engaged in the implementation planning process as part of the Croke Park agreement and have had significant input into the planning of the implementation process.<\/p><p>  The reorganisation under way is a major change in the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  The extent of it should not be underestimated.  It will impact on the lives and future careers of serving and future members of the Defence Forces right across the organisation.  This reorganisation has been extensively facilitated by the Croke Park agreement and the commitments given by the representative associations under that agreement to co-operate with major reorganisation and change.  The current initiatives being brought forward by defence management for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, taken with the earlier barracks closures, are far-reaching and challenging.<\/p><p>  Under the reorganisation, 118 officer promotion posts in the Army across all ranks up to brigadier general are being eliminated while NCO appointments are also being reduced by 225.  In addition, units are being relocated throughout the country while other units, such as the brigade headquarters in Athlone, are being disestablished.<\/p><p>  In implementing the reorganisation we must be conscious of the personal impact these changes will have on the lives and future careers of individual members of the Defence Forces.  To that end and contrary to much media speculation, there is no question of mandatorily requiring all the personnel serving in units changing location to move with their unit.  The Minister for Defence would like to allay concerns in that regard.<\/p><p>  The implementation plan, which has been designed by the high level implementation group, is designed to limit as far as possible the dislocation of personnel.  The reorganisation also generally maintains existing serving staff numbers in all the existing locations.  In so far as is practicable, serving members in the Defence Forces whose units are being moved or disbanded will have the opportunity either to move with their unit or to take up new appointments within or close to their existing locations as part of the reassignment process.  That said, it is inevitable that some personnel will have to change location or will be mandatorily relocated to fill out the appointments in the new organisation.  This is part and parcel of the employment conditions of members of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  It is not possible at this stage in the process to state how many personnel will be transferred across the Defence Forces on the basis of the current reorganisation.  The specific requirements in this regard will only become apparent as the implementation process proceeds and personnel indicate their particular preferences as to whether to move location or take up alternative appointments in their existing locations.  Obviously, this also applies to the transfer of the McKee Barracks staff and the choices they make on transfer or taking up alternative appointments in McKee Barracks.<\/p><p>  All personnel in the Defence Forces have been extensively briefed on the reorganisation proposals.  They will receive further briefings and information on the many options available to them as the implementation stage progresses.  As there are extensive vacancies in the organisation, many serving personnel will also benefit by moving to new roles and promotional opportunities to fill vacancies in the organisation.  The detailed administrative order setting out the implementation plan, which has been the subject of extensive consultation with the representative associations, has now been finalised and issued to formation commanders and made available to all members of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  This current radical reorganisation of the Defence Forces depends for its success on two elements.  First is the continued proactive engagement and leadership of civil and military management in the Department of Defence in modernising and restructuring the organisation to meet the new security challenges of today.  Second is the robust, positive and constructive engagement of the representative associations, on behalf of their members, under the provisions of the Croke Park agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000036#JJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1348153200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I must ask the Minister of State to leave it there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000036#JJ00900","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1348153200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I have only two paragraphs to go and I think it is important.<\/p><p>  The country is facing serious challenges in managing our current economic and fiscal situation.

I am sure the Minister of State will agree that what we are dealing with today is the fall-out from that reorganisation process.  The Minister of State's response is something of a curate's egg in that it is good in parts but somewhat contradictory.  I welcome that there has been engagement with RACO and PDFORRA.  Does the Minister of State regret that this engagement did not occur prior to the decisions being made and would he agree that it was somewhat perverse to announce that major reorganisation in advance of work being undertaken on the Green Paper?  <\/p><p> The Minister of State appeared to intimate in the earlier part of his response that relocation would be voluntary, that people would be consulted and given an opportunity to decide where they might go.  He then went on to speak about the inevitability of mandatory relocations.  Can the Minister of State indicate what quantum of personnel will have to move against their wishes to other locations?  The Minister of State also referred to career paths and stated that there would be new promotional opportunities.  However, he also, in the earlier part of his response, listed a plethora of promotional posts that would be done away with.  Perhaps he will clarify that point for us and will confirm what percentage of those to be relocated will be mandatorily relocated and the timescale for the changes envisaged.  This is a major problem in the area of the western brigade and the environs of Athlone, with many members who have huge mortgages and under real financial pressure concerned about the impact on them and their families of a forced move to a barracks at a considerable distance from where they are based and the ensuing costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000036#JJ01100","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348153800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I fully understand from where the Deputy is coming.

Monetary savings have been delivered through the reduction in personnel strength and the re-organisation will absorb the reduction in numbers and improve operational effectiveness.  The reduction in the number of brigades from a three brigade structure to a two brigade structure will free up military personnel from administrative and support functions.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the plans to transfer personnel from McKee Barracks to Cathal Brugha Barracks.  With regard to the projected strength of McKee Barracks and Cathal Brugha Barracks arising out of the re-assignment due to the re-organisation, the comparative strength as per the end of March 2012 was 663 for McKee Barracks while it was 760 for Cathal Brugha Barracks.

In this context, the review has taken longer than anticipated.  However, in practical terms, the development of proposals for the reserve would have been premature in advance of the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure.  Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure, the Government stabilised the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel and a major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force was initiated.  This encompasses a reduction in the number of army brigades from the current three to two.  As part of the re-organisation, Permanent Defence Force personnel are being re-deployed from administrative and support tasks to operational units.  As part of this process, the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel available to work full time with the Army reserve, known as the Permanent Defence Force cadre, is being reduced to 24 in each Army brigade - 48 in total - and additional support will be available to the reserve from within Permanent Defence Force units. <\/p><p>  The steering committee undertaking the value for money review of the reserve must have due regard to the revised Permanent Defence Force organisational structures and available resource envelope when framing its recommendations.

I am advised that the 2012 provision for the purchase of defensive equipment and ammunition is \u20ac27.5 million.  This allows for the acquisition of a range of priority defensive equipment and munitions, such as force protection equipment, chemical agent detection equipment, protective visors, body armour and the implementation of the rifle enhancement programme for the Steyr rifle, which has been in service for nearly 25 years.  The rifle upgrade programme is a multi-annual programme and represents one of the most significant investments the Government is making in terms of the impact it will have on Defence Forces personnel at the coal face.  The project is the subject of a number of tender competitions, the results of which will dictate the value of the programme.<\/p><p>  The provision also allows for the commencement of an upgrade and refurbishment programme of the explosive ordnance disposal HOBO robots.  Given the increased levels of call-outs for these services in recent years, the Minister is of the view that this will be one of the most important programmes to be carried out in the defence organisation in the coming years.<\/p><p>  The 2012 provision also allows for the acquisition of the ammunition types necessary to maintain stocks in light of training and overseas requirements throughout the year.  The 2012 allocation stands at \u20ac16 million for the placement of new and existing contracts.  A focus is maintained on ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations.  In this regard, the personal equipment that the individual soldier has at his or her disposal in Lebanon is second to none and compares favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.<\/p><p>  As many Deputies will be aware, the Department, with the Naval Service, is overseeing the acquisition of two new offshore patrol vessels.  The contract price for their provision to the Naval Service is \u20ac99 million exclusive of VAT and subject to contract terms and final agreed costs.  In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on LE R\u00f3is\u00edn and LE Niamh, will be \u20ac7.8 million exclusive of VAT.  The contract for the two new ships was placed with Babcock Marine Services, UK, in October 2010.  Payments on the contract are scheduled over a period of eight years - 2010 to 2017 - and are being funded from within the annual defence budget.  The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014 and the second will follow one year later.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Air Corps, there are no plans for the acquisition of new aircraft, but this situation must be seen in the context of significant expenditure on the Air Corps in recent years.<\/p><p>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/p><p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for the Minister for Defence.

This will determine the overall financial envelope available to the Department for the acquisition of new military equipment and for upgrade and refurbishment programmes during the coming years.

It is estimated by the World Health Organization that approximately 1 million people die every year from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It has long been recognised as being a serious threat to any military force operating in a malarious area.<\/p><p>  Lariam is a malaria chemo-prophylactic agent first authorised for use in 1989 by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Research has indicated that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  Whereas certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in drug safety newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the IMB remained of the view that the benefit-risk profile for the product remained acceptable. The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate.<\/p><p>  Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the IMB.  In accordance with best international practice in prescribing Lariam and taking account of the contra-indications, warnings and side-effects highlighted by the IMB, the Defence Forces screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system rules out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, such as depression, anxiety and other disorders which, as has been indicated by the IMB and other regulatory bodies worldwide, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.<\/p><p>  In the case of overseas missions to malarious areas, the medical screening involves a one-on-one assessment of the individual\u2019s suitability to be prescribed the selected anti-malarial agent in line with current IMB guidelines.  This typically involves a review of the individual\u2019s previous experience, if any, with the medication.  The individual\u2019s medical history is also screened for those conditions which have been identified as precipitating serious side-effects in association with the medication.  In addition, blood tests are carried out to ensure the liver is healthy, as liver disease is an accepted contra-indication to the use of Lariam.<\/p><p>  It is the policy of the Defence Forces medical corps that personnel found suitable for Lariam should commence their medication three to four weeks in advance of their travel.  This precaution allows a slow build up of the medication in the bloodstream and it also permits assessment by the person of the individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland.  Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure those with contra-indications to Lariam use are not prescribed the medication.<\/p><p>  To date, legal proceedings have been served against the Minister for Defence in five cases concerning the prescription of Lariam.  These claims are being managed by the State Claims Agency in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Given that legal proceedings have been served, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to comment further on individual cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000042#PP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1348156800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  There is ongoing international controversy, not least in the United States, about the impact of this particular drug.  I welcome the Minister of State's assurances that the position within the Defence Forces is being carefully monitored.

It would be unlikely to find many who would not be a bit anxious at the prospect of going to Chad, Syria or Lebanon.<\/p><p>  I took Lariam in the mid-1990s before a trip to Africa and suffered no ill-effects.

Three other antimalarial medications are available.  However, there are specific reasons for each of these products not being suitable for use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  Chloroquine is no longer in use because of the development of widespread resistance.  Doxycycline must be taken in the absence of dairy products.  It also produces some sensitivity to sun and sun rashes in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climates and for this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed by the Irish Medicines Board to be used for no more than 28 continuous days.  In this context, the prophylactic agent is suitable only for use where overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.  These are some of the reasons lariam remains the antimalarial agent of choice where malaria is virulent.  Advice has been sought from the Medicines Board and the World Health Organization.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reorganisation","time":1348157400,"count":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00450"},{"type":"question","time":1348157400,"counter":395,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[39493\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"if he will postpone his plans for the restructuring of the Defence Forces until the White Paper on Defence is published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00500"},{"type":"question","time":1348157400,"counter":396,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[39490\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"if he will report on his recent proposals for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces including the Southern, Eastern and Western Brigades; his plans to implement a personnel ceiling of 9,500 members of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1348157400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>To speed matters up can we take the reply as read because it is the same as a previous reply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00650","answer":true,"speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1348157400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>We can take it as read.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000043#QQ00675","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1348157400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p><p>  Information not given on the floor of the House.<\/p><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 22 together.<\/p><p>  Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure which reported at end 2011, the Defence Forces must operate within a significantly reduced resource envelope.  The Minister for Defence secured the agreement of the Government to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  However, at this strength ceiling, the organisational structures that had been in place for a strength ceiling of 11,500 personnel were no longer viable.  Accordingly, the Minister initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  A Green Paper on Defence is being prepared and is scheduled for completion at the end of this year.  When published, the Green Paper will initiate and inform a broad consultative process as part of the development of a new White Paper on defence.  The new White Paper on defence is scheduled for completion at the end of 2013 and will address defence policy and inform long-term capability requirements for implementation over and beyond the next decade.  In the context of the immediate financial realities and in order to maintain the operational capabilities of the Permanent Defence Force to the greatest extent possible, it was neither prudent nor practical to delay the re-organisation of the Defence Forces until completion of the Green and White Paper process.<\/p><p>  The Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff brought forward re-organisation proposals and the Minister announced the details of the re-organisation in July of this year.  This encompasses a reduction in the number of Army brigades from three to two larger brigades, a reduction in the number of headquarters, re-deployment of personnel to operational units, the consolidation of under-strength units and the disestablishment of certain units.

In 2011, some 57 alleged victims of human trafficking, including 13 children, were reported to the Garda.  I have no doubt some of them were transferred across the Border or potentially could have been.  We have had recent reports that the Real IRA has developed an alliance with three other dissident factions with a combined active membership of between 250 and 300.  These are two significant threats along our Border and the Athlone brigade headquarters at Custume barracks has traditionally been a vital cog in policing the Border.  This is why the PricewaterhouseCoopers report at the time recommended a structure remain in place that would facilitate the retention of the status of Custume barracks.

Notwithstanding this, the overall priority of the Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.   As the Deputy will be aware the Minister has confirmed that no further barrack closures are envisaged at this time.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces have the necessary resources to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government, including the provision of assistance to the civil authorities in any emergency situations that may arise throughout the country.  In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.

A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in relation to ATCP issues.<\/p><p>  Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they will continue to provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather emergency.

These arrangements continue to work well locally.<\/p><p>  The various procedures that are in place, both nationally and locally, were seen to operate very effectively during the Winter of 2010 as the Defence Forces made all assets, resources and capabilities available to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the periods of severe weather that occurred that Winter. The response of the Defence Forces proved to be extremely effective then and they will continue to provide the same level of support if requested should the need arise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000044#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reorganisation","time":1348158000,"count":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000044#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","time":1348158000,"counter":415,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[39523\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"if the option of voluntary relocation will be open to members of the Defence Forces as part of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000044#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","time":1348158000,"counter":416,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[39492\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"the scale of re-deployment of Defence Force personnel which will be required to facilitate the restructuring of the Defence Forces organisation to a two brigade structure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000044#WRA00900"},{"type":"question","time":1348158000,"counter":417,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[39524\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"if he has opened discussions with the representative bodies in relation to the implementation of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces; his views on reports that there is much confusion over whether or not Defence Forces personnel will have the option of voluntary relocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000044#WRA01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1348158000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 23 together. <\/p><p>  I have addressed many of the issues raised in these questions in my reply to the earlier priority questions. In relation to the disbandment of the Western Brigade, the Minister tasked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to bring forward proposals for a reorganization of the Defence Forces within the context of the reduced strength of 9,500 serving personnel.  Those proposals recommended that the Army component of the Defence Forces be reduced from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  This was on the basis that the three brigade structure, which had originally been designed for a force of 11,500, could not be sustained in the context of maintaining numbers at 9,500, without impacting on the capacity of the Defence Forces to deliver the services required by Government.  The Minister, having considered the matter in detail, accepted the proposals of the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff for the reorganisation of the Army into a two Brigade structure with Brigade Headquarters being located in Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>  On the transfer of the Mc Kee Barracks staff, the transfer requirement will not become apparent until such time as the implementation process proceeds further and personnel have indicated their preferences in relation to transfer or remaining in their current location.  On reassignment or transfer criteria, as I indicated in my answer to the earlier questions, this will be voluntary as far as possible.  Personnel will be reassigned using the following criteria - <ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">1.  Hold the substantive Rank of the appointment in question. <\/p><p>2.  Where a number of candidates meet the requirement for the appointment the following will be considered in order: <\/p><p>- If the applicant has had to change station due to Barrack closures during the period 01 August 2008 to 01 August 2012; <\/p><p>- Length of Service in the Rank relevant to the appointment <\/p><p>- Length of Service. <\/ul>  Opportunities will also be given for personnel to retrain and reskill to fill vacancies in their current locations, and this is being incorporated into the Defence Forces Training directive for 2013.  <\/p><p>  The maintenance of Defence Forces operational requirements must be prioritised within the reorganization implementation process.  However, within that context, where possible, all practical alternatives, including reskilling will be explored to avoid or minimize relocation.  Undoubtedly it will be necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disbanded or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.  This cannot be avoided.  It needs to be emphasised that this is not a painless process for personnel serving in the Defence Forces.  <\/p><p>  Serving members of the Defence Forces, officers and enlisted personnel, are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation which they would not otherwise make or in different times have had to consider.

Once this process is complete the matter will be submitted to Government by the Minister proposing that the Government recommend to the President that the person successful in the current competition be appointed as the new Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  It is anticipated that this process will be completed by the end of October.  While there will be a short interregnum before the appointment of the new Ombudsman, this is not a major concern.  The staff in the Office of the Ombudsman will continue to process and investigate cases pending the new appointment.<\/p><p>  The primary role of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is provided for in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces who have processed a complaint through the internal Defence Forces redress of wrongs process but remain dissatisfied with the outcome or the manner in which the complaint was handled. The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces. There are no plans to change these roles.<\/p><p>  Recent trends show a significant increase in the number of redress of wrongs complaints being resolved within the military system, thus reducing the number of cases being referred to the Ombudsman for investigation, a fact I very much welcome.  In addition, it is anticipated that the new and comprehensive promotion system for NCOs agreed and introduced earlier this year will eliminate the many complaint referrals to the Ombudsman, which account for about a third of the caseload.  Against this background, the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was advertised on a part time, three day week basis, subject to ongoing review of caseload and referrals.

Mortgage holders who are in difficulty with their mortgage obligations in respect of their primary residence have significant protections available to them under the Central Bank\u2019s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. In addition, the Department of Social Protection\u2019s mortgage interest supplement scheme also provides for direct support to mortgage holders that have had to avail of social welfare support.  Budgeting and debt advice is also available through MABS which is also funded by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  The &quot;Keane report&quot; made a number of recommendations to tackle the mortgage arrears problem, but it indicated that bankruptcy reform would be a central catalyst to the resolution of the problem and that, in particular, the early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial personal insolvency options is vital.  The 2010 Law Reform Commission Report also took a similar view on the overall personal debt situation and it also made a significant number of detailed recommendations for change.  The Government, having regard to its Programme for Government commitment to fast-track personal bankruptcy reform, took account of these reports in the development of the Personal Insolvency Bill which was published on 29 June 2012 by the Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Deputy will be aware that the Bill is currently before the Oireachtas and that the Bill has now been considered by the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.<\/p><p>  The provision of a mortgage advisory function is also key.  The Minister for Social Protection has recently launched this service which includes the provision of a mortgage arrears information helpline and the provision of \u2018one-to-one\u2019 independent financial advice by qualified accountants to mortgage holders when they are considering the offer of a long term forbearance\/resolution offer by their regulated mortgage lender.<\/p><p>  This service will tie in with the development and implementation of Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies by lenders as required by the Central Bank.  Under this initiative, mortgage holders are requested to segment their loan book and to put in place a framework for all mortgage holders experiencing difficulty, including those with the most difficult mortgage position and for whom a long term forbearance\/resolution option is likely to be the best option in the best interest of the customer.  In addition the mortgage to rent scheme involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and voluntary housing bodies is now in place on a nationwide basis.<\/p><p>  Regarding taxation measures, Budget 2012 provided for significant measures to help mortgage holders including the increase in mortgage interest relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008. Details of any future taxation changes will be a matter for decision at budget time.<\/p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progress measures to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet.  It is the intention of Government to ensure that those mortgage holders in genuine difficulty will receive appropriate assistance and a high priority has been assigned by Government to the implementation of this broad range of measures to assist those experiencing difficulty on their mortgage across the relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000046#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Clearance Certificates","time":1348159200,"count":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000046#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","time":1348159200,"counter":488,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[39915\/12]","dept":"Department of Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be issued with a notice of assessment for 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000046#WRCC02400"},{"type":"speech","time":1348159200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are awaiting the person\u2019s Income Tax return for 2011.

To this end, in November last year, I established a dedicated Reform and Delivery Office in my Department, led by an externally recruited Programme Director who has many years experience in leading change in the private sector.  Other key skills have also been brought into this office, for example on shared services and external service delivery.  The key role of the Reform and Delivery Office is to lead, support and coordinate the reform programme across the Public Service and good progress is being made in this regard, as set out in the Progress Report published on 6 September.  In addition, each Department \/ major Office has its own Change Delivery Team to manage and drive the reform process at organisational \/ sectoral level. <\/p><p>  In terms of formal governance, the key driver of the reform programme is the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform which provides political direction and accountability for reform.  The Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and which I convene, meets on a quarterly basis to consider priority issues and ensure that overall progress is being achieved.  <\/p><p>  An Advisory Group of Secretaries General has also been established, which provides support and advice on strategic \/ policy issues to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, a Reform and Delivery Board, primarily comprising Assistant Secretaries responsible for leading reform in each Department \/ Office, meets regularly to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and provide assurance to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to the Cabinet Committee that Public Service Reform is being successfully delivered.  <\/p><p>  In line with best practice governance, Project Boards have been established for many of the projects which are being implemented under the Reform Plan, for example for the various shared services projects.  In addition, each of the actions in the overall Reform Plan is assigned to a lead official, with Senior Responsible Owners appointed to lead the Major Projects which have been identified as being of major strategic importance.  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department is also working closely with each of the main sectors to ensure that they have appropriate governance arrangements in place to drive and support the delivery of their reform programmes.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, this Government is strongly committed to its ambitious programme of Public Service Reform and I believe that a robust governance framework is in place to ensure its successful implementation.

There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided \u20ac436 million for 2012.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department\u2019s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  Where a recipient\u2019s circumstances change, they must inform the officer dealing with their rent supplement claim who will determine if the change affects their on-going entitlement to the payment. In the case where a recipient changes address the rent supplement claim is closed and a new application must be made in respect of a new tenancy arrangement.<\/p><p>  Control is an integral part of the day-to-day administration of the rent supplement scheme. There are a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of rent supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims and warning reports issuing to officers where there is a change in the recipients circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent or is receiving payment in respect of accommodation where they no longer reside.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs at the address provided, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  I have recently introduced powers of enquiry for appropriate staff to formally request landlords to provide information in respect of their rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure will improve both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.<\/p><p>  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board\u2019s dispute resolution process.  Overpayments of rent supplement are recoverable from the recipient. A departmental debt will remain on the customers\u2019 records until fully recovered and may result in a reduction of all future entitlements, up to and including state pension and the disbursement of any likely estate upon death.  My Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments, including the initiation of civil proceedings, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000049#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","time":1348161000,"count":584,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000049#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","time":1348161000,"counter":585,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39685\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"the basis on which a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 is being assessed for rent allowance; and the amount they qualify for.","asker":"1021","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000049#WRF01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1348161000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>The person concerned is living alone and is renting a one bedroom property for which the rent is &#8364;529.00 monthly.

At present, there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement and the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future. In addition to this, spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure and in the context of the current fiscal crisis savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>  In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &#8216;risk of poverty&#8217; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.  The Government has made decisions on a number of changes to State pension provision including the changes to the rate bands which came into effect in September 2012 for new customers.<\/p><p>  Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &#8364;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) will be introduced to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant. <\/p><p>  The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. For information, the new rate bands are included in the table.  In addition, with effect from 6<sup>th<\/sup>   April 2012, late claims for the State pension (transition), State pension (contributory), widow&#8217;s, widower&#8217;s or surviving partner&#8217;s contributory pension will be limited to a maximum period of 6 months.<\/p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  In terms of the changes in the rate bands for determining the level of pension payment, allowing persons affected to sign on for credited PRSI contributions will not automatically guarantee an enhanced rate of pension.  For those due to reach pension age in the near future this is likely to be of marginal or no value.  Allowing retrospective credited contributions bridge any shortfall would remove all budget savings and could potentially give rise to significant additional costs.<\/p><p>  An information campaign in relation to all of the changes has been underway since March 2012 and all information can be accessed at <i><\/i>.  My Department also met with the relevant representative groups and information leaflets were disseminated to all relevant groups as part of the information campaign<\/p><p><b>Current State Pension (Contributory) Rates of payment <\/b><table><tr><th>Yearly average contributions<\/th><th>Personal Rate <\/p><p>per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years<\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years <\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>48 or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19 <\/td><td>&#8364;172.70<\/td><td>&#8364;115.10<\/td><td>&#8364;154.70<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; 14<\/td><td>&#8364;115.20<\/td><td>&#8364;76.80<\/td><td>&#8364;103.20<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>New State Pension (Contributory) Rates of payment <\/b><table><tr><th>Yearly average contributions<\/th><th>Personal Rate <\/p><p>per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years<\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years <\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>48 or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>&#8364;146.00<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 &#8211; 39 <\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>&#8364;139.00<\/td><td>&#8364;186.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 &#8211; 29<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><td>&#8364;130.00<\/td><td>&#8364;175.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19<\/td><td>&#8364;150.00<\/td><td>&#8364;100.00<\/td><td>&#8364;134.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; 14<\/td><td>&#8364;92.00<\/td><td>&#8364;61.00<\/td><td>&#8364;83.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Current State Pension (Transition) Rates of payment <\/b><table><tr><th>Yearly average contributions<\/th><th>Personal Rate <\/p><p>per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years<\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years <\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>48 or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>New State Pension (Transition) &#8211; Rates of payment <\/b><table><tr><th>Yearly average contributions<\/th><th>Personal Rate <\/p><p>per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years<\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><th>Increase for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years <\/p><p>Rate per week<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>48 or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>&#8364;153.50<\/td><td>&#8364;206.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>&#8364;146.00<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 &#8211; 39<\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>&#8364;139.00<\/td><td>&#8364;186.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24 &#8211; 29<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><td>&#8364;130.00<\/td><td>&#8364;175.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000053#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme","time":1348163400,"count":693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000053#WRK01800"},{"type":"question","time":1348163400,"counter":694,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[39851\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"if it is her procedure when processing rent allowance applications to ensure that the rented property owner in question is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.","asker":"1021","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000053#WRK01900"},{"type":"speech","time":1348163400,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

SAORSAT launched in March 2012.  Currently, SAORSAT provides access to the RT\u00c9 channels including the new RT\u00c9 channels developed for SAORVIEW and TG4.

The overall aim is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Also it should be noted that 7% of the TV licence revenue goes to the Broadcasting Funding Scheme to assist independent broadcasters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation","time":1348165200,"count":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","time":1348165200,"counter":767,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[39711\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the expert report on the property tax conducted by Dr. Thornhill will be published; if a job impact assessment has been conducted on the introduction of a property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00600"},{"type":"question","time":1348165200,"counter":768,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[39832\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to continue with the non principal private residence charge on second homes when the residential property tax is introduced in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00700"},{"type":"question","time":1348165200,"counter":769,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[39835\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the proposed property tax to be introduced next year will recognise and give credit to householders who are paying management charges in housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge by the local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","time":1348165200,"counter":770,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[39853\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that there will be eight bands with regard to the property tax and if band A is to take the lowest value of a property at \u20ac150,000 if he will explain the position in relation to properties, of which there are many, which will be valued at less than \u20ac150,000; his proposals with regard to these properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000056#WRN00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1348165200,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 139, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable local property tax to replace the household charge.   <\/p><p>The Group recently submitted its report to me and its recommendations will be considered in due course.\u00a0 Proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible and it will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation taking into account the modalities involved.

The 21-year pension consists of the following elements, all of which are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime: (a) basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank; <u>plus <\/u>(b) an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990; <u>and <\/u>(c) if applicable, fixed percentage additions in respect of certain other qualifying payments such as technician pay.<\/p><p>  An &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  However, the additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension (Contributory), or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65. At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p>  These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. &#8216;<i>Integration<\/i>&#8217; means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p>  However, the method of integration for military pensioners is actually less severe than in other areas of the public service.  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on qualification for the State Pension.<\/p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i> Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to these retired NCOs and Privates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000059#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","time":1348167000,"count":885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000059#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","time":1348167000,"counter":886,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[39719\/12]","dept":"Department of Defence","question":"the facilities or procedures available to army personnel (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000059#WRQ02200"},{"type":"speech","time":1348167000,"counter":887,"content":"<p>The provision of assistance to a family of a deceased member of the Defence Forces to help meet bereavement costs is provided for in Defence Forces Regulations A10 (New Series) Ceremonials and Funerals.

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State\u2019s fishery protection legislation and its obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.     It should be noted that responsibility for the prevention of drug-trafficking and people trafficking rests primarily with the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na respectively.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this work.  In this regard all Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in countering all form of smuggling and illegal fishery activity.<\/p><p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. The EU has provided funding towards the cost of purchase and upgrade of these aircraft.<\/p><p>  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.<\/p><p>  Funding is available from the EU under the Fisheries Control Programmes to strengthen fishery surveillance systems in Member State countries.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps through my Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, apply on an annual basis for EU funding for projects that enhance their fisheries surveillance role.  In recent years, my Department has received \u20ac0.325m (2010) and \u20ac1.073m (2011). The ship replacement programme accounted for \u20ac0.9m of the 2011 funding.  <\/p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.  The Group is working towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.<\/p><p>  Ireland along with other EU Member States participate in the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre \u2013 Narcotics (MAOC-N).  This Centre has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000060#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1348167600,"counter":906,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[39825\/12]","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the quantities of vegetables and carrots that were imported into this State in 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"991","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000060#WRR01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1348167600,"counter":907,"content":"<p> Imports of fresh vegetables into Ireland for the year 2011 and the period January-July 2012 are presented in <b><i>Table 1<\/i><\/b>   below.

This was the sixth in a series of reports based on data collected by the NEWB on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools through the Annual Attendance Report. This data can be used to monitor the levels of attendance, exclusions and suspensions across all of the country&#8217;s primary and post-primary schools. The series of reports is available in full on the website of the NEWB at<i><\/i>.  Data for the schools years 2010\/2011 and 2011\/2012 are currently being collated and verified with schools by the NEWB. <\/p><p>  The data gathered describe absences reported to the NEWB in specific circumstances such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the school generally has concerns about the educational welfare of a child in accordance of the statutory requirements of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Accordingly, the Board advises that data are not collated in such a way as to allow all the breakdowns requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual case can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating. For example, this work includes assistance with finding a school place and advice and support around Section 29 Appeals, suspensions and expulsions. In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level. <\/p><p>  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress. Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified. These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances. In 2011 there were a total of 3,845 children who received an intensive intervention from the Educational Welfare Service.  I have requested the NEWB to forward a copy of the 2011\/2012 analysis of school attendance data in primary and post-primary schools to the Deputy when it is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000061#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","time":1348168200,"count":946,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000061#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","time":1348168200,"counter":947,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[39715\/12]","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding free child care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick","asker":"1056","askee":"1009","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000061#WRS02200"},{"type":"speech","time":1348168200,"counter":948,"content":"<p>The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010 and is implemented by my Department.

Savings are being achieved through on-going off-patent price cuts; the pricing mechanism for new products has been changed; and we now have a review mechanism that takes account of price reductions in other countries. Since 2010 these actions have achieved savings in the region of \u20ac250 million. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, regulations made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 have reduced margins and mark-ups in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The combined full-year savings from these measures are \u20ac154 million.In addition, I announced on the 18th June 2012 that an interim agreement had been reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) to reduce the price of certain off patent medicines. This is expected to deliver savings of \u20ac10 million in 2012 (\u20ac20 million in a full-year). These price cuts were accepted in advance of further discussions which are expected to deliver more significant savings. Negotiations are ongoing between officials of the Department\/HSE and the IPHA since the interim agreement was reached. These discussions are expected to reach a conclusion shortly.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012.

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient\u2019s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. <\/p><p>  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that both taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market.  Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine, and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1348170300,"count":1065,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","time":1348170300,"counter":1066,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[39863\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"his views on the recent development whereby the Health Service Executive has introduced a cut in removing the facility in which persons that were in district hospitals or community hospitals and needed to go to a larger hospital to meet consultants or have tests done, transport which was previously organised by the HSE is now left to the families to organise the transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1348170300,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards Applications","time":1348170300,"count":1068,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01250"},{"type":"question","time":1348170300,"counter":1069,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[39866\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01300"},{"type":"speech","time":1348170300,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348170300,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","time":1348170300,"count":1072,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01550"},{"type":"question","time":1348170300,"counter":1073,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[39906\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"if an urgent hearing test can be arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Cork who was supplied with an unsuitable hearing aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1348170300,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards Eligibility","time":1348170300,"count":1075,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","time":1348170300,"counter":1076,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[39913\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"if he will consider amending the requirement for persons with genetic rare disorders to regularly re-apply for medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092000065#WRW01800"},{"type":"speech","time":1348170300,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive for a report on the issue raised by the Deputy.
