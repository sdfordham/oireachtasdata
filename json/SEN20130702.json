After learning the details of the revised code of conduct, the matter has become so urgent that I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance or his deputy, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, come to the House to explain the Government's strategy on mortgage arrears and the thinking behind giving the banks everything they wanted in the code of conduct.  I am sure most Senators have looked at the code, but, for those who have not, the context is that one in every four mortgages is either in arrears or has been restructured.  The Government is now permitting the banks open season on distressed borrowers and those in mortgage arrears.  It has removed the 12 month moratorium to which the banks had to adhere under the previous code of conduct.  After three months, or eight months in some instances, the Government will permit the banks to go to court to seek repossession orders.  That is reprehensible.  One of the protections the previous Government and Oireachtas gave to borrowers was to permit banks to contact distressed borrowers no more than three times per month.  That protection has been completely removed.  The Government is allowing the banks to contact distressed persons who are in arrears as many times as they want.  They are being allowed to call to borrowers' doors or ring them at any time of the day or night.  The Government is going to push people over the edge.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he understands the stress people are under and why, in God's name, he gave these discredited banks which we all know too well everything they wanted.  The banks keep speaking about co-operating and unco-operative borrowers.  What defines a co-operating or unco-operative bank?  When do we say a bank is not co-operating with the people to whom they lent money?  All the Government is requiring from the banks in the code of conduct is that they be proportionate and not excessive.  What is the definition of this in the context of what is being proposed?<\/p><p>The Government has refused to accept any legislation from this side of the House to establish an independent mortgage appeals board or an independent office that would make a decision on the future of a mortgage or the resolution of a mortgage problem.  It is allowing that decision to stay firmly with the banks.  I could say much more on this subject - I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence - but three minutes is insufficient time in which to do so.<\/p> <p>That is why I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance come to the House today to explain how this new code of conduct, agreed by the Government and the Central Bank, will help anyone in Ireland who is in mortgage arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200004#C00400","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372772400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will repeat what I said last week, following the continuing revelations from Anglo Irish Bank.  The key issue is to make every resource available to the Garda and the ODCE to ensure that prosecutions may be brought in a timely fashion.  There has already been a long period of investigation and the main concern for most people is to see the individuals responsible for the collapse of the banks being brought to justice in the criminal courts.  That is where the focus should be.  I was pleased to see the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Jim Hamilton, suggest that the priority should be the criminal investigation.  As legislators, we should ensure that there are adequate resources and structures in place so that any investigation can be carried out expeditiously.<\/p><p>I would like to commend the organisers of the Pride parade which took place in Dublin city centre last Saturday.  I took part in that, as did many other colleagues.  It was a really great celebration of the achievements of the LGBT community, legislators and civil society in ensuring progressive change.  There is still one outstanding issue, of course, which is that of marriage equality.  I hope we will see a referendum on that issue next year, as recommended by the constitutional convention.  I ask the Leader to allow for a debate on the recommendations of the convention.  We should follow up on the suggestion he made last week to invite Tom Arnold, the chairman of the convention, to the House in September to update us on the reports of the convention and on what he hopes to see arising out of it.<\/p><p>We will be debating the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 this afternoon.  Senator van Turnhout has tabled an amendment on the disclosure of psychotherapy and counselling reports in respect of children in sexual offence trials.  I know the Minister told us last week that the Law Reform Commission would be dealing with the general issue of disclosure of counselling notes in sexual offence trials, and not just those pertaining to child complainants.

I hope that our MEPs, whom he has met in this House, will alert him to the close links between Irish MEPs and the Seanad.  As Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, said to us when he was here, &quot;I wish to congratulate the Seanad in being to the fore in our national discourse on the issue.&quot;  Jim Higgins, MEP, told us that he is the envy of MEPs from other countries because of his links with the Seanad.  I hope the Taoiseach notes that.  He will also note that next week is the 34th anniversary of direct elections to the European Parliament.  Previously it was an appointed body, rather like the replacement for the Senate that the Taoiseach apparently had in mind at one stage.  Yesterday was also the 14th anniversary of the restoration of the Scottish Parliament and 26 July is the anniversary of the restoration of the Welsh Assembly.  It is a very good time for parliamentary democracy, and rather than going around finding out about Parliaments that were shut down 40 or 50 years ago, the Taoiseach should get in touch with new uses for parliamentary assemblies and devolved powers.  I hope all of that comes to light when he addresses the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  I read in a report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> on Saturday that a new postcode system is expected to be introduced within 18 months.

This system for the Republic will cost &euro;15 million and will have an annual running cost of &euro;2.5 million.<\/p> <p>That is all that is mentioned in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>article.  We would want to achieve savings of between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million to make the project worthwhile.  Will the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources disclose the overall cost-benefit analysis of the proposed system?  Of course, the company providing the system will have salesmen to say it is wonderful.  From the article, however, it looks as if it will cost &euro;15 million, money we do not have, with an extra &euro;2.5 million in running costs.  When the project was previously presented to the Government, it was claimed that it would save money.  A proper appraisal of the project needs to be made to see if it is worthwhile.  It is much easier to write addresses on letters in the Republic of Ireland than it is in the United Kingdom because we do not have a postcode system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200005#D00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372772700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I join my colleague Senator Sean D.

It relates to a number of banks which have been contacting customers who have tracker mortgages.  These banks are now trying to induce these customers into using their savings to make higher payments on their mortgages.  However, the banks in this scenario are not coming to this with clean hands.  It has been well reported in the past that the banks are losing a vast amount of money on tracker mortgages and it is clear that any steps that are being taken by the banks are to benefit themselves, not their customers.  For that reason, I am genuinely fearful their customers will be duped.  Any alteration in the terms and conditions of a contract between the bank and its consumer could result in the customer prejudicing himself or herself and his or her position, and I would urge customers to get independent legal advice before they do anything further in this regard.<\/p><p>Moreover, as we all will be aware, the property market is improving, with a 12% increase in prices recorded in Dublin recently.  The reality is that as time goes on the value of houses will increase and the mortgage repayments will decrease due to inflation.  This will undoubtedly put mortgage holders in a good position.

I stand to be corrected on this and I would be grateful if the Leader could get clarification from the Minster for Health.  The State has 30 dermatologists but the old Comhairle na nOispid&eacute;al recommended many years ago that we should have 45, which equates to one per 100,000 of population.  The UK ratio is one per 60,000, which is one of the lowest in Europe.  Even if this recommendation was fully implemented, we would have one dermatologist or skin specialist per 100,000 of population, which would still be among the lowest in Europe.  Between 1998 and 2008, the incidence of potentially lethal malignant melanoma in this country doubled from 400 to 800 per year while the number of potentially fatal cases also doubled from approximately 100 to 200 per year.

However, the SDU has told staff in outpatient scheduling divisions to no longer notify patients who have been on a waiting list for more than six months what the date of their appointment will be.

We were told by the assistant commissioner in Brussels that the basis for any resolution of the issue was in the TCCA's proposals on the 53 raised bogs in the State.  Since then the Department has not engaged with the TCCA.  There have been stand offs and will be more. <\/p><p>The turbary, property and constitutional rights people have to cut turf are not clear in terms of designations.  We need to have a debate with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, in a very measured way in order that we can tease these issues out.  If the Minister is wrong there could be a massive bill for the State if the matter ends up in the courts.  None of us want to see that happen.  We all want a proper resolution.

Unfortunately, it takes time for the law to take its course and people are frustrated by the amount of time it takes.  We must remember, however, that three people have been charged and I am sure there will be quite a number of other charges relating to that period a number of years ago.  The Garda must build a case and have evidence.  There is no point in bringing something to court without the proper evidence.

I refer to his comments on the special delivery unit and the notice to patients and I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  Senator Harte asked for a debate on rates and the fact that the property charges will help in that regard but that there is a need for an overall policy on rates.  I understand that 80% of the property charge will go to local authorities.  That is my information at the moment but I am not 100% certain.  This will have certain consequences for the equalisation fund because only 20% will remain for a number of other counties outside of areas with strong rateable bases.  That is a matter which I am sure will be discussed here with the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan.  Senator White and Senator Norris asked that asylum be granted to Edward Snowden.  It should be noted that asylum applications are not generally accepted from persons resident or present in other countries as our refugee status discrimination process is based on applications for asylum being made within the Irish jurisdiction.

The main purpose of amendment No. 1 which I hope will be welcomed is to extend, for human trafficking offences, existing rules that make it easier for children to give evidence in criminal prosecutions.  Article 15.4 of the EU human trafficking directive provides that member states shall take the necessary measures to ensure that in criminal prosecutions of human trafficking offences all interviews with a child victim or, where appropriate, a child witness may be video recorded and that such video-recorded interviews may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.  For the purposes of the directive, a child is any person below the age of 18 years.  Amendment No. 1 effects two significant changes to section 16(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 in respect of human trafficking offences.  First, to comply with the directive, it increases, from 14 to 18 years, the upper age threshold for out-of-court video recording of a complainant's evidence.  Second, the amendment also applies to a child witness, other than the accused, who is under the age of 18 years.<\/p><p>  While the scope of the amendment is limited to human trafficking offences, the extension of child evidence rules in the Bill is the first phase of plans for a wider extension of the rules.  There are provisions similar to Article 15.4 of the human trafficking directive in an EU directive on combating sexual abuse and exploitation and also in the EU directive on victims' rights.<\/p><p>  The other elements of amendment No. 1 are of a consequential nature.  The amendments to section 15 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 provide for consequential changes to the rules of criminal procedure.  At present, the prosecution must give notice to the accused that it is intended to give evidence in the form of an out-of-court video-recorded statement of a victim under the age of 14 years and give the accused an opportunity of viewing the video recording.  The amendments to section 15 extend this requirement to reflect the new categories of child witness whose evidence can be video recorded out of court.  Section 19 of the 1992 Act cross-references other provisions in that Act so as to apply rules relating to child evidence to vulnerable persons under 18 or 14 years, as the case may be.  The amendment to section 19 adjusts these references to reflect the new categories of child witness whose evidence can be video recorded out of court.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 2 makes a consequential change to the Long Title of the Act.  <\/p><p>  These are significant and worthwhile developments in assisting child victims of human trafficking offences in criminal investigations and proceedings.  I hope Senators will support them and I commend them to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#X00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p>I support these amendments to the Bill.

I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing on prevention and, hopefully, broadening the net.  I compliment the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on its recently published report and recommendations.  The most notable recommendation is to criminalise the purchase of sexual services by another person by means of prostitution or any request, agreement or attempt to do so.  The proposal should be clarified to ensure that no offence is committed by the person whose sexual services are sold.  The Minister has something to consider in that regard.  The amendments made by the D&aacute;il, particularly the amendment to section 4, are very positive.  I will speak on that later.<\/p><p>International co-operation on trafficking is very important.  We must ensure that the national referral mechanism works to its full capacity. The Minister is co-operating in that context with non-governmental organisations.  The mechanism is working well but could be strengthened further.  I was in Romania at the weekend to attend a meeting of parliamentarians against human trafficking.  A recommendation that emerged from the meeting was that every border agency should ensure full co-operation among all agencies.  I was alarmed to read during the week the comments of PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggot on the proposed national crime agency in the North to combat crime, including trafficking, across the Border.  Trafficking has no boundaries.  The Chief Constable said lives would be put at risk by curtailing the powers of the national crime agency.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP who blocked the initiative in the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in should ensure there is the fullest co-operation with all agencies of the Assembly and of this State so that policing operations work closely with those in the south of Ireland.  Constable Matt Baggott said there would be huge restrictions and lives would be at risk.  He expressed concerns that this was not given full support by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP.  The reason given was that they feared there was not enough transparency.  What transparency exists in trafficking?  There is very little; it is all hidden.  We must do all in our power to ensure there is full transparency.

I thank the Department for the help given to the BIPA committee on trafficking.  The European project of a common language and a dictionary of common terms used in trafficking, so that we are all using the same terminology across Europe, is important.

It is important that nothing be done to impede or prevent co-operation or to dilute the focus on targeting individuals engaged in trafficking.  What is particularly important is that we provide protection for individuals who have been trafficked and that we encourage and work with them to provide necessary information and evidence, North and South, to facilitate appropriate prosecutions while ensuring that those who are the victims of human trafficking do not feel intimidated in any way should they need to give evidence in our courts.

It has not been long since we took Committee Stage and I had hoped the Minister would take more time to deliberate on the discussion we had about the accreditation issue last week.  However, when we returned to our offices, we found that Report Stage would be taken today.  The Minister either deliberates quickly or there was not a huge amount of deliberation on the issue.  He was probably busy tabling his own amendments and I will take that on board.<\/p><p>  We have another suggestion regarding accreditation of the press when reporting in the context of the Bill.  It is an issue.  If anybody wants to report on a gig or a GAA football match or even the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a system of accreditation is in place.  For example, the Oireachtas will not allow any old journalists or a student with an NUJ card to walk in and report on the workings of the Houses nor would they get into the All-Ireland Final in Croke Park.  It is not a complicated system to put in place but the benefits of having a system of accreditation in the courts would be useful.  The amendment states:<blockquote>&quot;Bona fide representatives of the Press, in order to be permitted to attend proceedings referred to in subsection (1), shall be required to provide accreditation of the form prescribed in paragraph (b).<br \/>(b) Accreditation for the purposes of paragraph (a) shall be provided by the Court Reporting Accreditation Committee, which shall consist of the following ordinary members:<br \/>(i) a representative of the Press Council,<br \/>(ii) a representative of the Press Ombudsman's Office,<br \/>(iii) a representative of the Department of Justice and Equality, and<br \/>(iv) a representative of the Children's Ombudsman's office,<br \/>and the Minister for Justice and Equality shall also appoint a judge of the High Court as the chair of the Courts Reporting Accreditation Committee. The Courts Reporting Accreditation Committee shall operate on the basis of majority decision, and in the event of a tied decision among the ordinary members, the chair of the committee shall have the casting vote.<br \/>(c) Bona fide representatives of the Press, without accreditation as provided for in subsections (a) and (b) shall be prohibited from attending proceedings referred to in subsection (1).<br \/>(d) Subject to subsection (c), nothing contained in this section shall operate to prohibit bona fide representatives of the Press from attending proceedings referred to in subsection (1). <br \/>(e) Subject to paragraphs (f) and (g), where, in proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so<br \/> --&#8221;.<\/blockquote>  We are suggesting a simple procedure to be followed.  On Committee Stage, a number of Members said one would expect the judge to know the members of the press in the gallery.  That would not be a prudent way to go about this.  I have worked in the media for a number of years.<\/p> <p>It is not very difficult to get a NUJ card or even to have a NUJ card in a probationary position.  If someone has a valid NUJ card, he or she could easily argue to the person at the door of the courthouse that he or she should be allowed to come into the court and report on the proceedings.<\/p><p>It is not prudent to think a judge in Galway, for example, would know anybody from Galway who potentially has a NUJ card.  I could name hundreds of people in Galway who have either done media degrees or are bona fide journalists working in journalism on a daily basis and who would have a NUJ card.  Also, there might be a situation where the people involved in the case are from different areas or counties.  If, for example, one of the parties is from Dublin, somebody in the press in Dublin might be interested in the case and present at a courthouse in Galway to report on it in a bona fide way in their medium.<\/p><p>What we are proposing is a practical measure.  It would not be over-onerous.  It simply calls for an accreditation system to be put in place.  I realise the Minister has many amendments to deal with, but this is a genuine attempt to bring forward an amendment that would be workable and practical but which would put safeguards in place in order that there would be responsible journalism in cases of this nature.  I hope he will accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#AA01600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  As I said last week, the move towards greater transparency in the reporting of family law cases is good.  There has been far too much secrecy and at times it has undermined people's faith in the system unnecessarily.  It is good to have more reporting.  However, it is important - this is the objective of the Bill - that this be done in a responsible way, that there be adequate protection for privacy and anonymity in sensitive family law cases and that members of the press who report on such cases abide by these principles and ensure any reporting on child protection, divorce and other sensitive family law cases is appropriate, respectful and done in a responsible way.<\/p><p>This is a very positive amendment.  The process proposed is sensible and not overly cumbersome.  I agree with Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on whether a judge would know whether somebody was a member of the press and would know what was the most appropriate form of identity to seek.  Would it simply be a NUJ card or would more be required in such a sensitive case?  I do not believe most judges would like to be put in that position.  It would be sensible to have a simple process which journalists could go through to be vetted and receive accreditation.  That is the case for sports events and in reporting on proceedings in this House.  In the case of the most basic conference a journalist wishes to attend, he or she must register in advance and receive accreditation.  That should be the least we should expect in reporting on family law cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#BB00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for proposing the amendment.  I deliberate in a deliberate and focused manner and was conscious of this issue.  We might be dealing with this Stage at some speed, but obviously these are issues that were given consideration during the drafting of the various provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>I agree that there must be very careful rules regarding the publishing of material about family law and child care cases.  As Senator Averil Power said, it is important that cases be reported carefully and responsibly and that there be sufficient insight on the part of journalists to ensure that in their reportage they do not reveal identities or other information.  Of course, there are specific provisions in the Bill that seek to ensure this does not occur.  As I said on the last occasion, it would be useful if, following the enactment of the legislation, there could be an agreed protocol with and between media outlets on how they will report family and child care cases to ensure there is a degree of consistency in the non-disclosure of sensitive information or any other information that could identify individuals.  This has worked well in the context of the reporting of criminal prosecutions for sexual offences and where such reports are made by bona fide members of the media, there has been no major difficulty arising as to whether an individual is a bona fide member of the media.<\/p> <p>The Bill does not take a prescriptive approach to regulating the members of the media who may or may not be permitted access to relevant child care, family law and adoption proceedings.  The Bill leaves it to the court to allow bona fide members of the media to be present in certain circumstances.  It is a matter for the individual judge to be satisfied as to the bona fide nature of a representative of the press in this respect. <\/p><p>I reiterate that where this terminology has been used in other circumstances in respect of court proceedings it has not given rise, in practice, to any major difficulty of which I am aware.  As I said, the same approach is used in many legislative provisions and they also use the term &quot;bone fide representatives of the press&quot;.  If that term has allowed for matters to be reported in a matter that preserves people's anonymity and does not provide for the disclosure of information that would be an identifying feature in serious sexual offences when they are taken to court and prosecuted, there is no reason for it to give rise to any unexpected difficulty in dealing with family law matters.  The experience to date is that the approach works well.  I believe it is the correct approach in the circumstances of these provisions also.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I do not intend to accept the amendment, but I hope a protocol might be agreed with the media with regard to consistency in reporting and the protection of people's identities.  I think that would be a desirable thing.  It is my hope and expectation that the reporting of such proceedings will be undertaken with a degree of responsibility.  Of course, if reporting occurs that identifies individuals, that will constitute an offence under the legislation and will create a particular difficulty for the reporter and media outlet that so breach the legislation. <\/p><p>I would expect that there would be care and caution in the use of this.  Of course, if a difficulty arises that is not anticipated at the moment we will always have recourse, if needs be, to further changes in the law.  I am very conscious that this is a new departure in family proceedings.  Whereas I think it is desirable that we bring transparency to this area, the legislative structure we have provided is a very cautious one.  It gives rise to myriad circumstances in which the press may still be excluded from reporting particular family, child care or adoption proceedings, including circumstances in which it is in the best interests of the child that this occurs.  <\/p><p>This is a very careful approach because I am conscious, as someone who has worked in this area, of the huge importance of ensuring no barrier is placed in the way of individuals having their personal issues addressed in the courts and that there is no fear that matters of very personal nature could get publicity for sensational reasons where there is no real public interest in their reportage.  One bit of me has a reluctance to go down this road for fear that it may well be abused, but I think there is an overwhelming case for greater transparency so that people who use our court system have some understanding of how family proceedings take place, that there is some transparency in how justice is administered and that there are some insights into the approach taken and the consistency in that approach.  That may also be of assistance to Members of this House as legislators in determining on occasions whether laws as enacted are working as envisaged or whether there is a need for reform because the original intent of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not necessarily reflected in the manner in which cases are being heard and determined.  This a very sensitive and difficult area of the law which causes great emotional stress to any individual who finds himself or herself coming into our courts, particularly in circumstances of family breakdown, child care issues or conflicts in adoption cases, which can give rise to a great deal of stress and understandable emotion. <\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this.  It is a seriously intended amendment.  It is important that we tease these issues out.  It is important, as I have said on other occasions, that we acknowledge none of us has a monopoly on wisdom.<\/p> <p>However, the creation of the type of committee the Senator is suggesting could result in bona fide individuals assigned to report on family law proceedings having to go through a labyrinthine procedure or unnecessary delays before they can have access to the courts to report properly and responsibly on these matters.  That is a cause for concern.<\/p><p>The proposal in this amendment has not proved necessary in the reporting of serious criminal sexual offences in our courts, and I do not consider it necessary for the reportage of family law.  Any judge hearing a family case who sees a person sitting in the court will be in a position to query that individual's presence and to seek a validation, if need be and if there is any suggestion otherwise, that he or she is a member of the press.  The likelihood is, as is the case at present in other court proceedings, that reporters in family cases will be well known to the court clerks, registrars and judges because they are regularly reporting matters before the courts.  It is very unlikely that there will be myriad different reporters descending on the court system on different days.  As it stands, a large number of cases are litigated in the criminal and civil areas on a day-to-day basis, the vast majority of which never see the light of day in newspaper reports.  Only a minority will generate coverage by either the broadcast or print media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#BB00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am disappointed, however, that he will not take on board this amendment.  Some of the arguments he advanced actually strengthen the case for our proposal.  He acknowledged that this is a new departure in the law and that many of the cases involved are very sensitive.  This proposal would provide an additional layer of safety for the persons involved.  The Minister notes that it will be a criminal offence to breach the guidelines or the spirit of the legislation.  For the people who are victimised by that breach, however, by way, for instance, of a media report which names people it should not or gives details that should not be given, any action in that regard may well be too late.  Although we have a very responsible media in general in this country, we have seen how unscrupulous media outlets in other jurisdictions, not very far away, will pick up on the salacious details of these types of cases in an effort to sell newspapers.  That is precisely what we are anxious to avoid.<\/p><p>I do not agree that the procedure outlined in our amendment would be over-cumbersome.  I am aware of organisations which have an annual procedure whereby court reporters must apply for the relevant accreditation.  There is also the question of the time a judge might have to spend in ascertaining whether persons sitting in the courtroom are bona fide journalists.  An annual process of accreditation which furnishes journalists with a form of identification that can be presented for inspection would provide an easy and speedy means for the clerk or other official to verify their identity.  I appreciate where the Minister is coming from on this issue and acknowledge the extent of his experience in this area.  I remain of the view, however, that this provision would provide an additional safety valve, so to speak, in the context of this new departure in court proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#DD00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#DD00500","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 7:\r\nIn page 21, lines 10 and 11, to delete &quot;additional jurors have been sworn in the trial of a\r\ncriminal issue pursuant to&quot; and substitute &quot;jurors have been sworn in the trial of a criminal issue following the making of&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that these technical drafting amendments are necessary to improve the clarity of section 23.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#DD00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 8:\r\nIn page 21, line 33, to delete &quot;additional jurors have been selected pursuant to&quot; and substitute &quot;jurors have been selected following the making of an order under&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#DD01100","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372779000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 9:\r\nIn page 26, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:&quot;(b) by the insertion of the following definition:&quot;'Director' means the Director of the Insolvency Service;&quot;,&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>This amendment inserts the definition of \"Director\" in section 3 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 into the Bill.<\/p> <p>The definition is necessary for the interpretation of the Act, given the transfer of responsibility for the office of the official assignee in bankruptcy to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 corrects an error in the text.

It seeks to improve on the current text of the 2012 Act to make clearer what happens when a specified debtor's payment or payments under section 36(2) or 36(3) or section 37 amount to 50% or more of the specified qualifying debts concerned and when this happens.  Under the amendment, on the date on which a single payment is made that amounts to 50% or more of the specified qualifying debts on the date on which the aggregate of payments made amounts to 50%, the debt relief notice ceases to have effect and the specified debtor stands discharged of the specified qualifying debt.  In addition, the insolvency service is obliged to remove the information from the register of debt relief notices within three months of the date.<\/p><p>  The amendment is linked to similar amendments I moved on Committee Stage, which provide for the removal of information from the insolvency register &quot;within three months&quot; rather than &quot;without delay&quot;.  The more precise requirement necessitated a precise date from which the three months began.  The proposed amendment also makes clearer the fact that a single payment under section 36(2) or 36(3) that is worth 50% or more of the specified qualifying debts can lead to the debt relief notice ceasing to have effect.  This is not entirely clear from the current wording of section 37(3) of the Act, which suggests that payments under section 37 can only be taken into account in calculating an aggregate figure.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 14 provides for the amendment of section 34(4)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.

The amendment of section 34(5) is a technical amendment to remove the reference to &quot;the approved intermediary concerned&quot;.  The deletion is required for consistency with the rest of the 2012 Act as the approved intermediary has no role in the debt relief notice process at this stage.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 15, which provides for the amendment of section 36 of the Personal Insolvency Act, also arises as a result of the proposed amendment to section 37.

Last Wednesday on Committee Stage, I outlined in great detail the rationale and urgency behind my amendment, and I do not propose to do so again today because we are all here.  I have conducted extensive legislative analysis on my proposal, which I believe strikes the appropriate balance between the right of the accused to procedural fairness and the right of the child witness to privacy and personal dignity.  Without ready access to legislative drafters, it is difficult to translate a legitimate and necessary reform such as this into a legislative proposal, and I thank the Minister for his critique of my amendment on Committee Stage.  It has given me this opportunity, albeit with an extremely short turnaround time, to revert with a more robust amendment that I urge him to accept today.<\/p><p>  The Minister's primary concern on core procedure is very valid.  I have altered the wording to allow the matter to be considered pre-trial.  I have also added a reference to the rule of court to allow for further regulation of the application process by way of an amendment to the rules of court, should the Minister or the court rules committee find it necessary to do so.  For example, the rules could set out a prescribed form for such applications, time limits and so on.<\/p><p>  I noted the Minister's concerns in respect of the qualifications of a counsellor and clarity as to whom communication should be regarded as confidential.  It is unwise to specify any particular credential for counsellors.  This is partly due to the wide range of training and education approaches in the area.  More important is the avoidance of a situation where communication made by a child in confidence is disclosed simply because the counsellor did not pass all the exams, or passed the wrong kind of exams.  The regulation of the counselling profession is an important question, but there is a danger of allowing a preoccupation with credentials to distract from the purpose of this amendment.  However, to address the Minister's concern, I have added the following short provision which allows the Minister to refine, by way of statutory instrument, the definition of &quot;counselling&quot; and &quot;counsellor&quot;, while allowing the amendment to proceed.<\/p><p>  The amendment I have proposed states that the Minister &quot;may by order set out detailed criteria regarding the conduct of sexual assault counselling, and the training or qualifications of those who provide sexual assault counselling for the purposes of this Act.&quot;  I also noted the points the Minister made about the word &quot;encouragement&quot;.  While I believe it is a remote concern, I have removed the word from the section.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for his letter following the Committee Stage debate and I would like to address some of the points he raised therein.  He said that any proposal should address the rights of an adult as well as child complainants, and that immediate action is required, and as such he has decided to deal with the issue in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill.  In my Committee Stage intervention, I stressed the urgent to address the issue of third party disclosure of confidential records for adults complainants.  I know that there is a considerable amount of work being done by interested members, including myself and Senator Bacik, and by advocacy groups, and I welcome the Minister's commitment to act.  However, I do not see any justification for not proceeding with a legislative solution for children immediately in this Bill, as opposed to the sexual offences Bill, for which the heads have not yet been approved by the Government.  In February 2012 I brought forward a motion on child abuse material, and at that point I was promised it would be in the sexual offences Bill that would be published shortly.  I hope the Minister can understand that this is a very real and pertinent issue that is being dealt with at the moment.  Every child has the right to protection from harm, abuse and exploitation, including from criminal justice arrangements.<\/p><p>  As an aside, I must raise the experience of child victims of sexual abuse and the criminal justice system about repeated interviewing by separate agencies, most commonly in the context of parallel Garda investigations alongside a child protection investigation.  The attendant risk of further trauma and upset for a child in this context can be avoided by joint interviewing, which is done in other countries.  From a legal perspective, limiting the number of times a child is interviewed will reduce the potential for the type of contamination of a child's recollections of events which can lead to the failure to secure a conviction.<\/p><p>  We need effective co-ordination and training of garda&iacute; and social workers interviewing child victims of sexual abuse.  I note the arrangements in place for this in our neighbouring jurisdictions, such as the UK, in achieving best evidence, video interviews and the detailed, recommended practice for interviewing child witnesses in the latest edition of &quot;Achieving best evidence in criminal proceedings, Guidance on interviewing victims and witnesses, Guidance on using special measures&quot; and &quot;Guidance on joint interviewing of child witnesses in Scotland in 2011.&quot;<\/p><p>  I have already pointed out that there has been a notable increase in requests from the DPP's office seeking access to therapists' notes of children's private and confidential therapy sessions over the last six to 12 months.  That is a very real issue right now.  As an independent office, I appreciate that the Minister cannot directly instruct the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to revise its practice in this area.  There is no time to waste in introducing legislative guidelines.  I also appreciate the need for a solution that is workable from both a prosecution and defence perspective, but the arrangements proposed do not affect in any way the disclosure of material evidence or evidence relevant to a criminal trial.  The issue has been raised on a number of occasions, most recently in 2010 by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who is the Government appointed special<i> rapporteur<\/i> on child protection.  He stressed the urgent need for legislation then.  That was three years ago and no legislation has come forward.<\/p><p>  I do not have the legislative drafters that the Minister has at his disposal and the advice that he receives.  I do not need it for this amendment today in the Seanad, but it is not good enough that this will be promised in a Bill in the near future.  This is about children at the moment whose records are being handed over.  Parents have told me they are not sending their child to counselling because of this situation.  We have an obligation to do something.  I appreciate the Minister understands this issue as much as I do; probably more so from dealing with cases.  I have put this amendment forward in good faith and I have tried to get the balancing right.  I am willing to go back and work on this.  If it has to be brought through in the D&aacute;il, I have no difficulty with that.  It is not about my name, but about the children in these cases.  We have seen the increase in the DPP requests in the last six to 12 months.  This issue is escalating rather than going away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#FF01700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; mollta.  I would like to second the amendment.  We had a very comprehensive debate on the issue last week and I was hoping that the Minister might bring forward an amendment on it.  Last week, Senator van Turnhout showed that she had done a huge amount of research in the area.  She spoke a lot about NGOs.<\/p> <p>We raised issues between us which we have been discussing with other NGOs, such as the Rape Crisis Centre.  They have genuine concerns that the law is stacked against the victim in many cases and that the fear of coming forward to give information is increased by allowing access to notes from private therapy sessions.  It is a serious and telling issue which the Minister referred to last week.  Will he use his good offices to take on board the spirit of Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#FF01900","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator van Turnhout for her eloquent and passionate discussion of this amendment on Committee Stage at which the Minister engaged with us and which we all appreciated.<\/p><p>Several of us are working on the broader level of the disclosure of counselling records of adult complainants in sexual offence trials and not just complainants in respect of child sexual abuse.  As Senator van Turnhout said, there is a real concern that there are an increasing number of requests for disclosure made by defence teams.  Having worked in criminal defence at the Bar for some years, I noted there can be an increased tendency among defence counsels to undermine the evidence of complainants by way of a fishing exercise in seeking disclosure of their therapy sessions.  I accept it can be relevant in some cases but there is a concern that this is having a detrimental effect on complainants and their families.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated it is important the Attorney General would review the issues involved.  Clearly, there has to be regard for the due-process rights of the accused.  It is to be welcomed that the Law Reform Commission will undertake a review of this area of the law.  The Minister is correct that all of these issues should be codified in one Bill dealing with sex offences.  I have said before that it is unfortunate that so many of our provisions on sex offences are contained in many piecemeal Bills.  In principle, it would be much better if a provision on the disclosure of therapy and counselling notes in sex offence trials would also be contained in one Bill.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s point about delays is an important one.  It would be welcome if the Minister would review some limited form of amendment in the other House dealing with the specific issue of particular rules on the admissibility of evidence where the complainant is still under 18.  We have very specific provisions and protections around the provision of evidence by child witnesses.  For example, I have visited the excellent facilities for child witnesses in the new Criminal Courts of Justice building, a significant improvement to those in the Four Courts building.  If we were to make a special provision for the more restricted rule on disclosure of evidence in cases where the complainant is under 18, it would more likely withstand constitutional scrutiny than if it were a more general provision.  If we were to examine international conventions and case law, we would find more support for this special rule.<\/p><p>If the Minister cannot accept this amendment, will he consider a more refined version dealing with child complainants and the disclosure of counselling records to be taken in the D&aacute;il?  This might be a way of dealing with the particular concerns so eloquently expressed by Senator van Turnhout and those expressed to me by counsellors and those working in the Rape Crisis Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#GG00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Again, I want to thank Senator van Turnhout for raising this matter.  It is one on which, in principle, we are all agreed.  The issue is how we address it appropriately.  On Committee Stage, I said we should deal with it as speedily as possible.  I did point out that the issue is complex and requires careful consideration to ensure any proposal in this area correctly balances the constitutional right of the accused to due process along with the privacy rights of the complainant.  The Attorney General has advised me that a detailed examination is required to precisely identify and provide for the rights concerned.<\/p><p>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider whether it would feasible to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage or on D&aacute;il Committee Stage that could satisfactorily address the issue.  It is intended to complete the Bill&rsquo;s passage before the Houses rise for the summer vacation.  I have decided in such circumstances that there is, unfortunately, not enough time to comprehensively address this issue with the careful consideration required.  I have come to this conclusion because I believe further consultation is necessary with interested parties to bring forward a robust and workable solution.  I also want to allow time for full consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure any proposal put forward will work in practice to protect the rights concerned and ensure the effectiveness of the prosecution process.  I am also concerned that any proposal in this regard should be comprehensive and address the rights of adult as well as child complainants.<\/p><p>The examination and consultation on this subject, proposed by the Law Reform Commission, would be a suitable way of examining this complex issue.  I am conscious that the timeframe for such an examination is not appropriate and more immediate action is required.  Accordingly, I have decided this issue will be addressed in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill.  I am conscious this legislation has not yet been published due to other areas of legislation we have been addressing and the pressure on the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  However, it is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I expect the Bill to be before the Cabinet after the summer vacation and to be published at the end of October at the latest.<\/p><p>I believe this is the correct approach to ensure a suitable legislative solution is found as soon as possible to resolve the issue.  I hope the House will understand I cannot accept the amendment, not because I reject its purpose or value, but because the subject demands a fuller examination.  The difficulties in addressing this area are seen by the very helpful approach Senator van Turnhout has taken.<\/p> <p>We now have a new version of this proposal.  That is not a criticism of it.  Senator van Turnhout has tried to address some of the issues I raised of difficulty and complexity.  I welcome that and thank her for the work she has done on the provision that we now have.  I do not want to take up the House's time going through it in detail.  One of the issues I raised the last day, for example, was that this would be better as a pretrial procedure in the most cases.  Senator van Turnhout has prescribed it in those circumstances but I did say that, for example, during the course of an actual trial an issue could arise which would indicate that perhaps it would be legitimate for notes to be made available.  This provision does not envisage that.  I understand it does not because of the complexities involved.  This is not easy to draft.  There is also the question of treating the accused equally with regard to sexual offences.  Despite all of my concerns in addressing this in respect of children, I do think that, for example, an adult could be charged with the rape of a 17 year old or of a 19 year old and have different evidential rules in place with regard to the disclosure of information.  That could generate a difficulty in the criminal law area and might create constitutional problems.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik has highlighted another issue which we did not touch on the last time we discussed this Bill.  That discussion envisaged, although we did not all necessarily put it this way, a sexual prosecution taking place in circumstances where the court hearing occurred at a time when the alleged victim was still a child, not when the victim was an adult.  There is great complexity, a lot of law, a lot of court judgments and a lot of difficulty, for example, in validating allegations of sexual assault going back over the past 20 years.  In other jurisdictions it has arisen that someone in their 30s or 40s has gone through a form of counselling and perhaps that individual had difficulties in his or her life and retrospectively realised he or she was sexually assaulted at the age of eight or nine or 12 or 13.  There is a lot of literature about genuine memories and recollections or people being conditioned into recalling or believing events occurred in their lives that may not have occurred.<\/p><p>I can well understand Senator Bacik&rsquo;s approach in saying that perhaps this should apply only in circumstances in which at the time of the prosecution the alleged victim is a child but we do not live in a black and white world.  What happens if the prosecution is initiated when the victim is a child but becomes an adult before the case is put to trial?  We need an all-encompassing rule in this area that deals with the issue of access to these notes, whether the victim is or was at the time of the assault and prosecution a child, or whether the victim was a child at the time of the alleged offence but is an adult at the time of the trial, or whether the victim first said an offence occurred 20 years after becoming an adult.<\/p><p>We need a consistent and careful legal architecture that seeks to ensure that people who seek counselling are not presented with barriers but seeks also to ensure that there is due process where an accusation is made, and that, on the other side, we have the balance of protecting people's privacy, the need and right they have to have access to help, be it psychological, psychiatric or counselling of another nature, following being a victim in this area.  Unfortunately, this is a complicated issue.  It is best that we address it comprehensively and that we engage in, and complete, a consultative process.  It is my intention that we address it in this sexual offences Bill.<\/p><p>I could well conceive that because the Bill is so advanced we would be at a point where we could publish it as heads of a Bill before we finalise it in the way we have done, where this particular matter has not been completed but work on it will continue and be completed before we publish the Bill in final form.  That could well be the case but I want to assure Members of the House that I do take this issue seriously.  I am of course aware of Geoffrey Shannon's 2010 report on this issue.  I recall raising it when I was in opposition and I hope we get the opportunity to address it.  I genuinely thank Senator van Turnhout for what has been an important discussion, one which has probably contributed to ensuring that the matter is not delayed until the Law Reform Commission addresses it but that we do address it within the Bill.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout made a very important point in talking about the impact, particularly on children, of repeated interviews by different agencies.  That is an issue on which I know there is supposed to be a co-ordinated approach.  Repetitive interviews are supposed to be avoided.  I will discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the approach taken by the HSE and the new child protection agency, when it is in place, to these matters and the coordinated and cooperative nature of Garda involvement where it is required.  There are of course occasions when interviews take place on the social service side, which may involve child protection issues at a time when it may not be immediately clear that garda&iacute; need to be present, or at a time when their presence might be counter-productive.  Garda&iacute; may be present and there may be a need on occasion for the HSE to refer the matter to the Garda.  There will be instances in the future when it is impossible that there be one set of interviews by social services and members of the Garda.  I will also raise this issue with the Garda Commissioner to see, where it is possible, that repetitive interviews be avoided so that a young person who has suffered a trauma and been the victim of an alleged assault does not have consistently to relive that experience.<\/p><p>I am, nevertheless, also cognisant of the fact that not all information necessarily comes out in an initial interview, that individuals may be traumatised, that they may be able only to give limited information but if the problem could result in a criminal law process, in order for that process to take place and for a Garda file to be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, it may well be necessary for a young person, who is the victim of a sexual assault, to be interviewed on more than one or two occasions so that there is clarity about the nature of his or her description of events.  Alternatively, if issues arise during the course of an investigation it can well occur that the alleged victim must again be consulted and further questions may arise to ensure that the full background is understood and any inconsistencies that emerge are addressed so that if a file is sent to the DPP it contains the fullest and most comprehensive information possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#GG00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  On the last point, the Cabinet Secretary on Justice at the Scottish Parliament has issued guidance notes on joint investigative interviewing of child witnesses.  That could perhaps be done quite easily in co-operation.<\/p><p>  With regard to the substantive amendment, perhaps in the consultations the Minister might, in addition to consulting the DPP, consult the NGOs and the victims' units that deal with the cases at the moment, and discuss their relationship with the DPP.  They are very conflicted over the role they play in counselling and how to ensure that people are brought to trial for the offences they have committed.  They face an impossible dilemma.  We need urgently to find a way to deal with it.<\/p><p>  I am very happy to share the work I have done so far with officials to see if we can progress this issue.

It started off as a relatively modest courts Bill.  In the context of the myriad issues that I am anxious we address and the reforms that I want to see implemented, it has proved, because having published it we let it sit for some time to give different groups and individuals an opportunity to consider its contents and make submissions on it, particularly in the matter of the reporting on family and child care cases, to be a useful legislative vehicle to try to address some other reforming issues.  There were still others that I had hoped we might be able to deal with, but, unfortunately, that did not prove possible in the timeframe involved.<\/p><p>I can tell Senator Jillian van Turnhout that I can guarantee that we will have another civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill sometime in the next 12 months to address a number of other issues, in respect of which I have got bees in my bonnet, that I want to reform and that affect important areas but to which we could not devote a Bill on its own.  There are one or two further amendments to the Insolvency Act that we did not have ready for the Seanad that I expect we will introduce in the D&aacute;il, which means that this Bill will revisit this House for a short time following its progress through the D&aacute;il.  I am not sure whether the Attorney General will put up with my adding any subject matter to it.  I do not think we will do this.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their very careful and detailed consideration of all the provisions in the Bill.  At its heart, the Bill is important, from its starting point.  It will have a dramatic impact on the courts system and we are effecting very important reforms.  For 20 years the jurisdictional basis of the courts and civil proceedings has remained unchanged.  No notice has been taken of the increase in the cost of living.  The reality is that today the District Court has, because of the increase in monetary values, a far more restrictive jurisdiction than it had in 1991, which is bizarre based on current values.  In the Bill we are increasing its jurisdiction to &euro;15,000 across the board generally.  It is only &euro;6,000 now.  Had we simply dealt with cost of living issues, it would be in the region of &euro;10,500.  That indicates the extent to which the value of monetary disputes has diminished in the District Court during the years.  The same applies to the Circuit Court.  It has had a jurisdiction generally in the region of just over &euro;38,000 since 1991.  Based on inflation, even to keep step with 1991 values, it should be in the region of approximately &euro;65,000.  We are increasing it to &euro;75,000 to take cognisance of the fact that this is important to the stability of the jurisdiction for a number of years and to take account of what are the appropriate capacities in both courts.  The effect of this will be that a substantial amount of work currently undertaken by the Circuit Court will now be done at District Court level.  It will save substantial legal costs for those who have to resort to court proceedings.  Some of the litigation that currently takes place in the High Court will, when the Bill becomes operative, be undertaken at Circuit Court level.  For those who need to use the court system in civil matters, there will be substantial savings in legal costs.  The other impact will be to free the High Court from some work in which it currently engages where there are disputes over sums of money below &euro;75,000 which will in the future be addressed in the Circuit Court.  The add-on impact will be fewer appeals to the Supreme Court.  It will take some time for this to impact on the system because the cases initiated before these changes take effect will have to continue within the court system in which they have been taken.<\/p><p>It is my objective - this is why I am very anxious we complete the legislative process before the summer vacation - that the relevant provisions in the Bill will come into force very early in order that when the courts are open in October after the summer vacation, they will operate under the new financial jurisdictional limits.  That is very important.  The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is being increased to only &euro;60,000 in the case of personal injury actions.  We will have a new approach in the context of jurisdiction, which is in the public interest.  It will mean that we will better utilise the court structure.  The exciting development for the court structure is that before we get too far into the autumn, we will have the referendum to establish a general court of appeal, which I hope will have the universal support of all sides of the House and will be supported by the public.  This will be another brick in the wall of the reforming agenda that we are seeking to implement in the public interest, which is important.<\/p><p>I thank Members of the House for their assistance and co-operation and dealing in a very considered way with the additional matters we have now included in this legislation.  I am sorry that I will be imposing on them again on matters that will arise in the D&aacute;il that we could not have ready in time for the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#JJ00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Several colleagues have said they would like to make a brief comment.

The Minister has my support in that regard.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 1 inserts, &quot;The Bank [that is, the Central Bank] shall publish in its Annual Report a statement of the reforms undertaken by bodies in respect of which reports of breaches were made.&quot;  On Committee Stage, the Minister was concerned that we referred to what had happened to the individuals.  The object that we had in mind was that if Mr. X made a complaint, where is he now?  The Minister was concerned that complainants should have anonymity and we have rephrased that to put the emphasis on the reforms.<\/p><p>  I mentioned on the previous occasion - it is mentioned in the briefing notes that the library service helpfully prepared for us - that the misgivings of Ms Estelle Feldman, who has studied this in Trinity College, Dublin, about breaches and whistleblowing are that the organisation never gets reformed and the whistleblower is punished.  I am also concerned that in some banks this has been going on for decades.  I refer to the ICI affair in the 1980s, the offshore deposits that were not offshore at all, secret pension funds for executives in the Caribbean, and then the gold medal one on 29 September.<\/p><p>  We must be able to measure progress as we try to eliminate these malpractices from Irish banking.  There have been a serious number of insurance collapses also.  How does the Central Bank know if we are making any progress in these matters?  Is it worthwhile reporting any breaches at all?  Nothing happens, they continue on as before, they get bailed out and the taxpayer gets stung again.<\/p><p>  We have rephrased the amendment in light of the Minister for Finance's concerns which, of course, we accept, in that we were not protecting anonymity.  How do we know if this is having any effect at all?  From listening to radio programmes, the furious wish of the Irish people is that the banking system should reform itself.  Can we have a measure of progress?<\/p><p>  As with all of these amendments, if they are of use to the Minister, we offer them in that spirit.  If Deputy Brian Hayes finds that they are not, it will not cause any great annoyance.  The public wants a new regime for regulating banks and these are suggestions from me and my colleagues on these Independent benches that could be off assistance.  If they are worse than that and might obstruct the Minister in the reforms, obviously, we would not push them.<\/p> <p>They are offered in the context of the anger since the release of the Anglo Irish Bank tapes about the conduct of banking in Ireland and the need for a stricter regulatory regime.  Every day in the House, Senators on all sides express their conviction that we are not making progress and that Irish banking is unreformed.  Banks do not treat people who fall into arrears well and they try to induce people to get away from their tracker mortgages.  Paddy O'Gorman of RTE discussed in the last couple of days cheque cashing services coming within the general remit of financial services.  Where one seeks to cash a cheque for &euro;50, one receives &euro;38 in cash.  This happens where people cannot wait five days for the money.  Why does it take five days for a bank to perform cash transmission in the era of electronics?  No credit is available for businesses.  This is about dealing with breaches, reforming the sector and looking for evidence that it has reformed.  Deputy Hayes and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, must deal with these issues on a daily basis.  I am not so sure the corporate culture has changed.  It must be sent a message from the Houses of the Oireachtas that we are opting for stricter regulation.  In that spirit, I offer my proposal to the Minister of State.  If it helps his hand, that would be good.  If there is no positive impact on what he is trying to do, that is fine.  We tried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#LL00800","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I am happy to second the amendment.

In the context of banking reform and Central Bank supervision and enforcement, I wonder how the Central Bank operates currently in dealing with the newly published code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which, in effect, gives the banks everything they want.  While the Government is apparently reforming, as is badly needed, the banking sector, we have opened the floodgates for the banks.  They have the nod of Government and the Central Bank.

I see that there is a problem with doing that, but we have not, unfortunately, been provided with any time to discuss the new code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The Central Bank, which is the subject of the Bill, is allowing the banks to make as much contact with customers as they deem fit.  The limit of three times a month which was set out in the previous statutory code is gone.  The Central Bank says it will allow proportionate and not excessive contact.

Has Government, or the Central Bank, set out a definition of &quot;non-co-operating bank&quot;?  In the new code of conduct, all power is vested in the banks and the Government has not taken into account the need for an independent mortgage appeals office, as called for by many, to take matters out of the remit of the banks, which did such damage to the country.  When one adds the figures for those in arrears of 90 days or more, those in arrears of 30 to 90 days and those who have had their mortgages restructured, one sees that 20% of all mortgages in the State are in distress.  While Central Bank supervision and enforcement, which is the subject matter of the Bill, are very important, we have taken the legs from under citizens who are paying for the very banks that ruined the economy.

The Minister for Finance and I accept fully what has been said by Senator Barrett, whose only objective is to improve the Bill.  He seeks not to stand in the way of its passage but to add to it.  The Bill, which I took on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, has been hanging around, as it were, for the past 18 months.  It came in as one Bill, but was substantially amendmended on foot of two very significant Private Members' Bills introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on finance, Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p> <p>These were inculcated into the Bill and it showed a readiness on the part of the Minister for Finance to respond to good ideas on the part of Opposition Deputies and Senators.  He has continued in that vein with this Bill.<\/p><p> I take the point that the Senator raises and I will explain the reasons we think the amendment is superfluous.  It is important to put this on record because these matters are often referred to in court.  Having the opportunity to explain them gives an insight into the minds of the Oireachtas Members in terms of the passage of any amendment to the legislation.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to include a new provision into Part V of the Bill, which requires the Central Bank to include in its annual report a statement of the reforms undertaken by financial services providers on foot of whistleblower disclosures.  I remind Senators that the Minister introduced an amendment in the D&aacute;il in response to concerns raised by Opposition parties on a similar point.  This is effectively section 38 of the Bill, the new section introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage on page 28.  The amendment inserts a new section into the Bill requiring the Governor to report to the Central Bank Commission on whistleblower disclosures and the action taken by the Central Bank on foot of them.  In this way, there will be appropriate oversight of the Central Bank's responsiveness to whistleblower disclosures.  Section 38(4) reads: <blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) The Governor shall provide a report to the Central Bank Commission at least annually on any action taken or not taken in response to protected disclosures.<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) The Central Bank Commission shall determine the form and content of the report to be provided under <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>.<\/blockquote>In our view, what Senators Quinn and Barrett are looking for is already contained in the legislation.  The report will be given, in the first instance, by the Governor to the Central Bank Commission and the commission will issue a report on an annual basis.<\/p><p> In the course of performing its function under the Central Bank Acts, the Central Bank receives information through a variety of means, including the provision of information by firms in response to statutory requests, information from authorised officer inspections and information obtained through regulatory returns.  The Central Bank also receives information through voluntary disclosures by financial services providers through routine reporting and other engagement on compliance issues.  It is a matter for the Central Bank to decide what action, if any, is required on foot of it receiving particular information, whether through whistleblowers or other means.  Based on its assessment and on subsequent investigations, the Central Bank may require action by the financial service provider.  The action may include compliance with regulatory direction, the provision of customer redress, administrative sanctions or the prosecution of an offence.  The Central Bank cannot require action on foot of the whistleblower disclosure alone.  It must first satisfy itself there are sufficient grounds that warrant action.  The action may only be required following due process and fair procedure.  In such cases, financial services legislation already provides for the publication of details of the action to be taken, the nature of the sanction or direction, albeit subject to some ground rules including, for example, ensuring the publication of the administrative sanction does not inhibit the prosecution of an offence.  On that basis, I am satisfied there are appropriate measures in place to ensure oversight of Central Bank action and transparency on the action required to be undertaken by financial service providers following due process and fair procedure.  This addresses much of the substance of the points raised by Senator Barrett.  The Minister for Finance is more than happy that the Senator is raising this issue again this evening.<\/p><p> I agree that what is required is a strong regulatory regime, which is clear and transparent for all to see.  Senator Barrett referred to Estelle Feldman, who is a friend of mine and who has written extensively on the topic of whistleblowers.  She is also a distinguished academic in Senator Barrett's university.  She has done much of the pioneering work in this area and has helped Opposition Deputies in producing legislation.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, would make the following point if he was here.  It is firm intent of the Government to produce, for the first time ever, legislation to protect whistleblowers across Irish public administration.  It is a key part of what we want to do in the political reform area and much of what Ms Feldman has written about over the course of the past decade and a half in her extensive research has greatly helped the Government and informed it of the legislative approach it should take.  We need to protect people who have information and use it in such a way as to act in the public interest.  We also need discretion for public agencies to investigate these matters and to come to a view on the substance of the allegations being made.  With regard to amendment No. 1, it is already provided for under section 38.  The Minister responded to an Opposition Deputy on Committee Stage in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#MM01600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  We are <i>ad idem<\/i> on this.  In response to these appalling bank crises and flops in the country, let us consider what was the reaction to the first crisis.  It was that banks shall not buy insurance companies, or certainly not the one that bought an insurance company in London.  We took action against the illegal offshore accounts and the pensions in the Caribbean for bank executives.  All of this happened in one bank.  There was an array of policy responses to the people who bankrupted the country.  For Ireland's credibility internationally, we protected the whistleblower.  However, what about the rest of us?  Are we protecting society from this kind of conduct, which we all agree has been appalling?<\/p><p>  I might have tackled the problem in a different way but I share the goal of the Minister of State.  My concern is that it is not locked away in subsection 56.  When the Minister of State goes to European meetings, he can say that it is in our report that we took certain measures.  It is in section 38 and presumably it can be announced in reply to parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  We might have been ripped off on the first occasion but we took measures to ensure it does not happen again.  Everyone who lends money to the country will want to know what we did in response to the people who wasted it previously.  It is important the Seanad has received from the Minister of State a strong undertaking that we cannot keep doing this and that we will take measures to prevent a recurrence.  That is what the Minister of State said and it is what I am seeking.  I will not press the amendment but I thank the Cathaoirleach for his forbearance.  This is important because otherwise banks will shrug their shoulders and continue on as before.  Many people in the House and in the country are wondering when the banks will reform.

We were talking to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, last Thursday and saying that we must distinguish, according to the American model, between Wall Street and Main Street.  Regulation of banks in the interests of banks is what we have had up to now.<\/p> <p>Attempts to correct the problem through quantitative easing promote asset bubbles which are again in the interests of banks and stockbrokers and not in the interest of the wider economy.  The shortage of capital as we try to develop a new entrepreneurial economy will not help.  The Minister's view last Thursday in the House was that he hoped that the competitive aspect of Irish banking would be improved by banks coming in from abroad.  He was hopeful that we would attract an industrial bank, which would provide competition.  While it had to be done at the time, the pillar bank concept is flawed in that it lead to a duopoly.  It may be such a duopoly that no foreign banks will want to set up here and that deterrent would not be in the interests of the wider economy.  Bearing in mind that the Minister says the State could try to develop a more competitive banking system and discussions may be taking place, we have a problem with the banking sector.<\/p><p>The June 2013 edition of the Compecon publication dealing with regulatory easing and competition states it is important to analyse competition agency decisions.  At EU level and in most member states, competition agencies are responsible for investigating and deciding on alleged infringements of competition law.  Ireland is somewhat unique in an EU context in this regard.  The Competition Authority's role is limited to carrying out investigations while it is for the courts to decide if parties have broken the law.  Central Bank regulation of banking failed spectacularly in 2008.  The Government is trying to get the regulation of banks out of a silo.  They have a blinkered look.  What is this doing to the economy, asset prices and people's living standards?  Why can housing or industry not be funded in a different way?<\/p><p>We experienced a classic case of regulatory capture prior to 2008.  The agency which was supposed to regulate banks in the wider public interest was captured to the extent of staff playing golf and winning prizes with the people they were supposed to regulate.  It was a disgraceful performance.  The Minister of State will note the deficiencies in our policy highlighted by Pat Massey in the Compecon paper.  Banking is too important to be left to bankers.  The new Governor, who is a former colleague of mine in the economics department of TCD, will seek to steer a different course given that his predecessors were captured.<\/p><p>This is not unique.  I asked on Second Stage who is supposed to regulate accountants.  They prepared accounts for the banks and the bankers were not regulated.  The State has tame regulators for electricity where the chief executive officer earns multiples of the Taoiseach's salary and the same can be said of the airport and transport sectors.  I am worried about sectoral regulation by regulators who have a tradition of being tamed and utterly dominated by the sector and who operate regardless of the consequences for the rest of society.  It is necessary to have somebody say a sector is not competitive and it could be made more competitive if the Competition Authority was brought in.  The competition regulator in Ireland is much weaker than in other countries, as Pat Massey says, which damages our competitiveness.  Having an input ensures we do not drift back to a regulatory regime where banking is unduly influenced by bankers attaining control over the Central Bank as they did so ignominiously in the past.<\/p><p>The amendment is an attempt to make the control of banking more of a team game in the interest of the public.  Perhaps if the Central Bank, Competition Authority and Competitiveness Council look at the competitiveness aspects, they will diverge but we badly need new insights into what banking has done to the rest of the economy.  Currently, the emphasis is entirely on restoring the financial health of the bank.  We know in this House, as does the Minister of State, that we are trying to restore the economy and the two are not the same.  The two certainly were not the same on 29 September 2008.  That is why I have tried to broaden the way we look at banking.  It is interesting that the Irish-Canadian, Mark Carney, has taken over as governor of the Bank of England.  He is trying to broaden bank regulation.  He comes from a highly successful background in Canada where none of these banking problems occurred and economic growth continues.  We need more inputs to get away from a silo.  If we had more inputs, the problem we are trying to correct now would not have happened.  I am not interested in prosperous banks; I would much prefer a prosperous economy.  I would like the other impacts to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#NN00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  It was interesting to read British financial newspapers over the past week and see references to Mark Carney and Canada being saved because of his regulation.  We got used to light touch regulation over the past 20 years and it seemed to do a world of good for some aspects of the economy until everything went wrong.  I did not realise that Ireland had such a weak regulatory system.  We thought we had a good system, not only in the banking sectors but in other sectors.  It appears we were incorrect and the light touch regulation got us into trouble.  Senator Barrett's amendment is worthy of consideration.  It takes a long time to get anything done in Ireland and not only in the context of regulation.  The US, UK and Japan moved much more quickly than we did to deal with criminal offences in the banking sector.  We take a long time.

The prosperity of the economy is inextricably connected to the prosperity of our banks because we own most of them and the greater part of one of them.  The only way we will get our money back in some shape or form is to bring them back to some trajectory of profitability over the years.  Given the enormous amount of taxpayers' money put into these entities, the only way to get it back is to bring them back to a financially viable position.  We need a change of culture in banking where bankers know their business no different from Senator Quinn when he was in the retail business or Senator Barrett when he taught young people in TCD.  One has to knows one's business.  The great dilemma in the banking system was bankers were disconnected from their business.  They did not know the people who had deposits in their banks and regarded them with arrogance.  They did not make prudential investments in businesses or entrepreneurs and put all their money into bricks and mortar.<\/p><p>  We need to imbue a fundamental change of culture and I hope this legislation, which has been hanging around for a long time, meets the challenge of better regulation and exposes us to international experience.  Senator Barrett's point in this regard is well made.  We need to expose our entire regulatory establishment to the international rigour other countries employ.  It is more important in Ireland than other countries because we are small and highly deleveraged.  We have a huge private sector economy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> our public sector economy.  The financial services sector comprises 16% of the economy, which is large, although it is 30% in Luxembourg.  In a large financial services sector, which the State wants to expand, a regulatory environment is needed within the Central Bank culture which meets that need and which people say meets the international standard people will stand over.  I very much agree with that.<\/p> <p>I very much agree with that.<\/p><p>On the substance of the amendment, section 49 already provides for the Central Bank to consult with any entity it considers appropriate, so the consultation envisaged by Senator Barrett is already permitted under the Bill.  Section 49(1)(c) provides that the Central Bank may consult with such other persons as the bank considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.  There is no difficulty with the Central Bank consulting with the Competition Authority and the National Competitiveness Council, as it sees fit.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out earlier today in the Lower House, ultimately the Central Bank is independent of the political system.  It must be, by definition.  Unless it is we will not have a regulatory environment or culture that is free of the political shenanigans that can sometimes take place.  Section 49 empowers the Central Bank to consult with whatever it chooses in its work.<\/p><p>I read the transcript of the Senator's discussion with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on Committee Stage.  It was an interesting discussion in which the Senator discussed the issue of competitiveness.  We need a competitive model in this country.  The Senator suggested that the pillar bank model will not fit the bill and will fail.  It is a little like the French Revolution in that it is probably too early to tell.  However, the Senator is at one with the Minister for Finance when he speaks about competition.  In a series of later amendments we try to address that in respect of foreign banks from outside the European Union.  We would allow those banks to open branches following approval of the Central Bank, to encourage the type of competition the Senator wishes to see.  There is nothing to stop such banks coming to this country at present.  The success and stability of the Irish economy is predicated on more international banks coming to invest in Ireland and seeing Ireland as an opportunity.  They will not come unless they see a future for the country.  The Irish economy and the banks are inextricably linked.<\/p><p>In amendments Nos. 5 and 6 we will deal with the lack of competition issue, which the Senator discussed with the Minister for Finance.  It is on foot of that discussion that the Minister has tabled amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to try to deal with that issue and to have a more flexible approach for encouraging non-EU banks to come to this country to establish branches.  That will provide the competition and international experience suggested by the Senator.<\/p><p>The Irish banking system has gone through a torrent of change and it is only fair for Senators to ask if that has led to a cultural change.  That is the kernel of the issue here.  We have set out our stall in terms of the pillar banks.  The banks have become smaller entities and following the Mercer report the Government is now seeking reductions of between 6% and 10% in pay and remuneration across the banks.  All of the boards have effectively been taken out.  There is now more international experience within those banks.  If one examines the stress testing that followed the establishment of the pillar banks in March and April 2011, there was a very strong tiered capital ratio of 10.5%.  The likelihood is that when the new EU stress testing of banks emerges in the first quarter of next year the capital ratios will be approximately 9.5%.  There has been much change within the banks, and they need to get on with that change and make sure they have the people in their retail and commercial settings to deliver the model that is required.  Fundamental to that there must be a regulatory environment that works for everybody.<\/p><p>The collapse we experienced was not just a banking collapse but essentially a collapse of the entire regulatory system.  There is no doubt about that.  It is a matter of huge concern to the Irish people.  I agree with the Senator's remarks earlier about the tapes.  People want to get to the bottom of this.  They want answers and, ultimately, they wish to see prosecutions in the courts.  All of these matters will be resolved, hopefully to the satisfaction of the public and these Houses, through the inquiry system the Government intends to put in place.  All of those banks, regardless of whether their tapes have been published so far, would have to make themselves available with that information to an inquiry, were it to be established.  That point has been made very forcefully by the Minister for Finance today.<\/p><p>While I welcome the Senator's amendment, there is no need for it.  Under section 49 the Central Bank can consult with any entity it chooses in respect of the competition issue.  We are hoping to deal with the substance of the Senator's point about competition in amendments Nos. 5 and 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#OO00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Section 49 provides that it may consult with such other persons as the bank considers appropriate.  That is what happened.  We now have a Central Bank Governor who I hope, and particularly if he is listening to this debate, will consider what something is doing for competition and competitiveness in the Irish economy.  However, if the bank does not consider that appropriate, it will not happen.  Obviously, in the past it did not consider it appropriate because that is how we got into trouble.  My preference would be to push the Central Bank to take a wider interest and, as the Minister of State said, to take a look at what the new governor of the Bank of England is doing.  We have referred to bad banks but we probably had a bad Central Bank as well which did not do its job up to 2007.  If they gain control of the Central Bank again, they might say they will just consult with the people they like because the choice is entirely theirs under section 49, which provides that the bank consult such persons as it considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.  We are trying to provide that it should include the interests of competition and competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Our ability to draft these amendments was limited.  When the debate was adjourned last Thursday it was adjourned to Tuesday.  Tuesday means <i>ma&ntilde;ana<\/i> in the Seanad, as the Minister of State will know from his time here, so we did not expect it to happen on Tuesday.  There was hardly any time to frame amendments because they had to be tabled by 11 a.m. on Friday and we finished late on Thursday.  I had hoped the Minister was moving towards running banking in the interests of the wider economy and not just as the bank considers appropriate, given that this institution really let the country down.  One version of what happened is that the Central Bank was the bigger failure and the banks just did whatever they got away with.  That was massively damaging to the country.  At this stage, I would not be interested in what the Central Bank considers the appropriate way to regulate banks because whatever the model was it did not work and we are now paying the bill.<\/p><p>  Why will it not consult widely before it makes regulations, as we are asking it to do in this amendment?  Is it that in Ireland we always think in silos and people do not venture outside their own narrow patch, so nobody is looking after the wider national interest?  Who in the Central Bank or in the Department of Finance does not want to consult the two bodies mentioned?  It is really silly that they will not.  Why is the Central Bank seeking such power whereby it will decide whom it will consult?  That is the way it is phrased at present in that it can consult such other persons as the bank considers appropriate.  The Central Bank failed and we, as legislators, are telling it to do things better in future even if, informally, it could assure the House that it will never again be dominated by the sector it is supposed to be regulating in the national interest.  That is the silo mentality we have, with people not thinking outside the box or looking at other areas of the economy and the damage they do to those areas.<\/p><p>  I regret that the amendment is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>It would improve the Bill if it was.  The Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banks have to up their game on what they did to this country.  I do not understand why the Minister of State was advised not to accept even a mild amendment like this, particularly as we thought the Minister was heading in our direction before the debate had to end rather suddenly and it turned out to be a real rather than ma&ntilde;ana Tuesday.  We hoped he would think about it more. <\/p><p> I do not know how this will be read outside Ireland.  The Government is not willing to accept a statutory consultative role for the wider economy in the way we run banks so soon after the banks developed a rather strange and unacceptable vocabulary, as the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the President have said.  It is a strange and unacceptable way of running banks.  It indicates a certain dismissive nature towards Parliament when the Minister of State is advised to respond in this way.  It would not have done any harm.  A few egos may have been bruised a little but that is mild compared to what has happened to the rest of the country.  The Minister of State has had to deal with that in terms of special needs assistants and reductions in pay and child benefit.<\/p><p> It is strange that we cannot have a mentality that it is a good idea to have people on board discussing what this will do for competitiveness and competition.  As we have said <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, Ireland has high cost and sheltered sectors, which restricts our ability to develop competitive international sectors.  Banking is one of those sectors; no other sector has imposed such a burden on the rest of us.  It is regrettable that there is a mentality of not reforming what should be reformed and continuing to defend what we used to do in the past, given all the evidence of the damage that has been done to the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#PP00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>It is not fair to say we are in disagreement on this.

In the normal course of events such discussions will take place. <\/p><p>  I agree that wider influences would have to be brought to bear in making any regulations.  The section is about consultation before regulations occur.  Specifying one or two agencies may lead to difficulties, rather than stating a bank be given the power to consult with whatever it so chooses because it is independent of Government.  It represents the Irish taxpayer and the ECB system, one could argue, given its legislative role, but in its functions it is independent of political interference.  I have absolute no difficulty in saying to the Senator publicly that we expect this would happen in the normal course of events.  It may be an issue on which the Governor wants to comment when he comes before committees or is questioned by Members of Parliament.  To stitch it into the legislation is not necessary <i>per se<\/i> but we appreciate the point the Senator is making.<\/p><p>  As I said, if one included two agencies there would be an argument for including 105 other agencies.

I do not wish to detain the Minister of State.<\/p><p>  The amendment proposes that the ombudsman report include information about complaints.  We seek to add what is stated in the amendment.  The rest is covered, such as the name of the regulated financial provider, including any trading name, the identity of any group of which the regulated financial services provider is a member and the number of complaints signed to be substantiated or partially substantiated in respect of the regulated financial services provider in the preceding financial year.  <\/p><p>  There was a complaint yesterday about a situation in which a bank decided not to charge a person &euro;12 to cash a &euro;50 cheque.  These organisations have a tradition of cocking a snook at the Government, the Central Bank and the rest of us, and are still talking to us through their tapes on a daily basis.  We need to know what happened and whether the abuses were addressed and corrected.  This is against the background of the work of Estelle Feldman, whom the Minister of State mentioned.  She fears that organisations do not reform and whistleblowers are penalised.<\/p><p>  There was a report on 22 April 2012 by Daniel McConnell and Tom Lyons on the whistleblowers' dire warnings which were silenced by senior finance chiefs.  It quotes Robert Pye and Marie Mackle.  Ms Mackle said, &quot;I've paid the price for being an internal whistleblower.  As matters stand currently, I am completely ostracised and my work is ignored.&quot;  If people are going to go out on a limb we have to know whether anybody listened when they drew to our attention what happened and whether the reforms that took place can be included in a report.  This is a good place in the Bill to introduce that.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State said, we are trying to change a corporate culture.  I appreciate what he said but many in the House would see it has not changed.  Banking in Ireland used to be a utility service.  People lodged savings which were looked after and ready for them when they grew old.  It inculcated a habit of thrift among young people.  That was replaced by the managerial casino generation which wrecked banks.  I am not sure whether the latter group has been fully expunged from the banking system, because it is not the picture painted in the House on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  This section gives the Government a mechanism to ask what happened in regard to complaints.<\/p> <p>The Financial Services Ombudsman will then be able to include that information in his or her annual report.  The banks might not like this proposal, but the rest of us who are paying dearly for their actions will not tolerate a situation where they are not held fully accountable.  Ensuring full accountability is the object of this proposal.  Representatives of the banks have been before the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, but we are still not getting the whole story.  We must use every piece of armoury at our disposal to make institutions accountable, which includes a requirement to report on how they responded to complaints made against them and the reforms they introduced when whistleblowers exposed the many abuses in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#QQ01000","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Senator Sean D.

Therefore, the Bill is going to go through without any improvement from the Seanad.

These branches would be subject to the same standard of regulation as those branches currently passporting into Ireland from within the European Union.  The Central Bank Act 1971 provides the statutory basis for the authorisation regime for credit institutions in Ireland.  The 1971 Act and the related European directive - the capital requirements directive - also provide the basis for the passporting regime within the European Union.  Passporting is a system which allows financial services operators legally established in one member state to establish and provide their services in the other member state without further authorisation requirements.<\/p><p>These amendments insert three new sections into the Central Bank Act 1971 to provide an authorisation regime for credit institutions which are authorised outside the European Union to operate a branch in Ireland.  These third country banks would be able to apply to the Central Bank for an authorisation on the basis that the institution would remain under the responsibility of its home regulator in terms of prudential regulations, but would be subject to Central Bank rules on the conduct of business.  The new section, 9A, provides that the Central Bank can only grant an authorisation where the credit institution is subject to a regulatory system in its home territory, which is at least as robust as the Irish system.  Furthermore, the level of protection afforded to deposits by virtue of the bank's authorisation in its home country must be at least as robust as that which operates in Ireland under the deposit guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>The Central Bank is also required to notify the relevant European authorities of any authorisation under this section.  This arises from the requirement in the directive that third country branch authorisations should not offer more favourable terms to credit institutions passporting from outside of the European Union than would be available from within the European Union.  This will act as a further check on the system to ensure that this regime does not act in any way to dilute the standard of regulation that applies.<\/p><p>The new section 9B sets out the provisions that are to apply where the Central Bank refuses a grant of authorisation and is based on the system that already applies to domestic credit institutions.  In short, it affords an opportunity to the applicant to make representations where the Central Bank is minded to refuse the application and before the Central Bank has issued its final decision.<\/p><p>The new section 9C sets out the provisions that are to apply where the Central Bank revokes a third country branch authorisation and is also based on the system that already applies to domestic credit institutions.  The grounds for revocation include circumstances in which the holder becomes unable to meet its obligations to its creditors; no longer provides security for the assets entrusted to it; is convicted on indictment of an offence under the provision of the 1972 Act; is convicted of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust; is a company that is being wound up; or no longer holds an authorisation from the relevant third country authority.  In this case, the provisions afford the opportunity to the institution to make representations before the Central Bank has issued its final decision.<\/p> <p>The Central Bank must also consult the third country authority unless immediate action by the Central Bank is required, in which case only notification is required.  This section also sets out the responsibilities on the branch after its authorisation has been revoked and these mirror the provisions that apply to domestic credit institutions.  In brief, the institution's responsibilities towards deposits and with regard to other repayable funds do not change post-revocation until those responsibilities have been discharged to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.<\/p><p>I indicated earlier that we would be moving with these amendments.  The Minister flagged these amendments on Committee Stage.  It is hoped these will add some dimension of competition to the Irish domestic banking situation in order to encourage the third country banks to establish branches in Ireland.  They would be subject to the same oversight and regulatory environment as other institutions in this country.  If such banks could be encouraged to come to Ireland, albeit in a small way, this would be a means of ensuring a competitive banking system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#SS01100","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We acknowledged on Committee Stage that the Minister had accepted quite a few Opposition amendments from the D&aacute;il.

I note the irony of the Minister of State's remarks on the day that Ulster Bank, which is an established bank, is closing 40 branches.  This shows the difficulty faced by anyone wishing to establish a bank here.  There is a further difficulty and it is a case of which comes first, the chicken or the egg.  The existing pillar banks are not lending to the companies who are starved of cash flow because they are not profitable enough.  They cannot become profitable enough because the cash flow is not being made available to them.  Until these companies become profitable these banks - which are primarily based in other jurisdictions - will not even look at this country.  They will not look at this country because businesses are not in sufficient profit.<\/p><p>I question whether this new section in the Bill will be of any real benefit in the near future.  The country is now going back to depending on AIB and Bank of Ireland.  When he was a Member of this House, Deputy Shane Ross called them the fuddy-duddy banks for not keeping apace with Anglo and Irish Nationwide.

I am on the record as opposing the pillar banks approach because I thought we missed an opportunity by subsuming EBS into AIB as outside investors were interested in doing that.  Competition will be the issue.  The Minister's amendment attempts to entice competition into the market.  The only other bank which is expanding in Ireland is KBC, a Belgian bank.  It is opening new branches and is beginning, tentatively, to lend in the first-time buyer market.  It is not operating in the commercial and business sector and that is a problem.  The past few years have seen massive changes in the banking sector and this Bill will create further changes.  I agree these two amendments are important.  I think the EBS is now effectively dead.  It was the largest lender to first-time buyers even in the period 2009 to 2010.  It is finished now and it has no real lending capacity in any shape or form.  The credit unions have also been reined back - correctly so in some instances and not so in other instances.  Many businesses were obtaining loans from credit unions but their lending have been restricted.<\/p><p>I hope that in ten years time we will not rue the day when we did not sell EBS in late 2010, early 2011, when the deal was done.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for his own good reasons, decided to subsume it into AIB and to create, in his view, two strong banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  However, Senator D'Arcy is correct.  Ulster Bank is shutting down 41 branches and reducing its activity in the market.  I suggest that if it were not for its technical IT issue over the past year, the bank would have announced these closures earlier, perhaps one year ago.  That is what former colleagues of mine in the market tell me.  We will need to be very careful to see what decisions Ulster Bank will make.  I refer to the comments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Ulster Bank had to be propped up by the British Exchequer and that British banks should concentrate their business.  We need to watch very carefully with regard to Ulster Bank's future in the Republic.  <\/p><p>I agree that these are sensible amendments which are needed.  I wish to put on the record of the House my opposition at the time to the pillar banks approach.  I hope I am wrong and I hope we will see competition in the market because it is desperately needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#TT00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I support the Minister's amendments.  It will be extremely difficult to introduce competition into the Irish market in this way because the two pillar banks are so protected.  We were doing the same for VHI for a long period and also for CIE and Aer Lingus.  If outside investors see one or two companies being supported utterly and totally by the taxpayer, they will find it very difficult to put a proposition to their boards that they should enter the Irish market.<\/p><p>As other Senators said, Ulster Bank seems now to have been as irresponsible as any of the indigenous banks and the British taxpayer had to bear the burden for it.  It is probable that Bank of Scotland Ireland was even more irresponsible than the others.  The first understanding is that the British taxpayers will pay if any of these banks goes broke.  We have been caught to pay for the Irish ones.  Even then there is a downside risk because the first bank in this country to go belly-up was DEPFA.  Much of the subsequent hostility of Germany towards Ireland was that DEPFA bank was not sufficiently regulated within the IFSC.  <\/p> <p>That cost the German taxpayer dearly.  New banks are needed.  As the other Bill before the House has in mind the separation of utility banking and casino banking, perhaps we might rebuild banking.  The irresponsibility that took over Irish banks - Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Irish Nationwide Building Society were appallingly unregulated businesses - has cost us dearly and left us in a most unsatisfactory position.  So far our experience with foreign banks has not been good.  <\/p><p> I wish the Minister of State well.  Unfortunately, it will be a long time before any Member of the House feels the benefit of the new banks.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the Industrial Credit Company had an expertise on which a completely property-based associated bank system was based and we have to try to recreate it, perhaps through the foreign banks the Minister of State mentioned.  I know the Minister for Finance is keen to get his money back, as all of us are, but I no longer see the banks as entrepreneurial activities.  They do not have the abilities, training or capabilities to do that work.  Inventing new kinds of bank, on which the Minister was very keen the last day and which the Minister of State has mentioned again, will be the way forward.  Bringing them in, as proposed in these two amendments, is an advance.  Like other Senators, I wish the Minister well in these endeavours, but I would like to be much more optimistic that this will work as it deserves to.  We need that expertise.  As an alternative to pouring good money after bad, it is well worth exploring.  <\/p><p> In the current edition of <i>The Phoenix<\/i>there is a downbeat assessment of where AIB stands as one of the pillar banks.  I know the Minister is reasonably optimistic, but unless the corporate culture changes and the banks improve - we in this House would like to see evidence of this - I do not believe they will play much of a role in promoting the economy in the future.  What the Bill has, therefore, is a very good set of amendments which I will support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#TT00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  It would be unfair to suggest the contributions, from all sides, have not been useful.  In the discussion we have had on the sections they have been useful, specifically on these two amendments.  Senator John Gilroy spoke about this.  Equally, it is fair to say the Bill has been in gestation for some time and has been amended and changed significantly to take on board the issues the Opposition has raised.  This is certainly not the Bill we started out with; it is, effectively, a completely new one and has been greatly strengthened as a result.<\/p><p>Much of our discussion has been about what happened in the past.  There comes a time, however, when we have to talk about what is happening now and the future and where we see the economy growing.  It is absolutely the case that there can only be a successful economy where there is a competitive banking model underpinning it.  I always refer to the point that when we first came into office, had I been told at the end of December of that year we would own only 15% of Bank of Ireland, I would have asked for the chaps in the white coats to take me away because that would not have been possible.  However, it did happen, which was an extraordinary boost of confidence in the new Government's ability to sell a substantial amount of Bank of Ireland to get it away into the private sector.  We have seen the benefits that can accrue.  I have no doubt that the reason sentiment in the country has changed is there is a view abroad that finally we have got our act together in banking, not only in terms of the new regulatory system to be established under the Bill but also in terms of the decisions we have taken on the pillar banks.   <\/p><p>I concede, however, that the devil is in the detail and, more importantly, the delivery.  We now have to deliver the things we said we would.  I refer to the mortgage issue mentioned by a number of Senators.  We have set very clear targets for what has to be achieved and must deliver on this and ensure it is done in terms of the Central Bank's dialogue with the individual banks concerned.  Equally, when it comes to lending into the real economy, a commitment was given by the pillar banks to lend over a three year period more than &euro;21 billion - as it were, a kind of Irish quantative easing.  The banks were, effectively, stuffed with cash in order that they would lend into the real economy.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg.  In circumstances where people cannot get credit and appeal to the Credit Review Office the decisions in 60% of cases are overturned, which proves the system is working.  Unless we are talking about a positive future and mindful of the mistakes we made in the past, we will not get the country to a better place and will certainly not get the banks to a better place.<\/p><p>There was a comment on the fact that Ulster Bank intended to close 41 branches.  That is an unfortunate indication of where modern retail banking is going.  It does not see its role to have large branch networks up and down the country.  The advances made in Internet and online banking have meant banks can do things differently and deleverage their own systems, reduce their cost base and, in consequence, focus on their core business.  The same applies to Ulster Bank, as it does to other banks, notwithstanding the difficulties this causes in communities, which I fully accept.  <\/p><p>What we are getting at in both amendments is summed up in an awful modern phrase which I will use because it probably explains what I am trying to say - bespoke banking.  I do not believe the banks that will come in, as Senator John Gilroy remarked, are going to be the large-scale, high street banks which will establish networks willy-nilly around the country.  However, specific banks will come in that have specific market interests.  For example, one of the things in which I am most interested is Islamic banking, which offers extraordinary opportunities.  The Islamic banking model has been hugely successful.  It deals with the issue of prudential risk, invests long term and does not go for the speculative property bubble, in the way many of our commercial banks did.  There is now an opportunity for an Islamic bank to come to Ireland.  There is also aviation finance - a big issue in Senator Darragh O'Brien's constituency - which is hugely important business for Ireland.  We are a world leader in this regard and there is no reason we cannot make an opportunity for third country banks through the use of aviation finance.  Third country banks could have the opportunity, by way of a bilateral arrangement, to come and use the existing network of banks and branches.  That is provided for.  Do I see this immediately as a new opportunity?  I do not, but by the provision of these sections there is now the opportunity, if banks want to invest in this country.  That has happened as a result of observations made in this House, on which I congratulate Senators.

Prize bonds are part of a range of State savings products which include savings bonds, savings certificates, instalment savings, national solidarity bonds and deposit accounts such as the ordinary demand deposit account and the 30 day notice deposit account plus.<\/p><p>State savings products form part of the sovereign debt of Ireland, which is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency.  An Post and the Prize Bond Company are agents of the National Treasury Management Agency in respect of the State savings product range.  Neither An Post nor the Prize Bond Company retains or manages any State savings money.  All State savings money is placed directly with the Government under the management of the NTMA and forms part of the national debt.

Approximately 8,000 other cash prizes are awarded each week.<\/p><p>The European Council and European Parliament have adopted legislation to protect the financial system and certain professions and activities from being misused for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the third EU money laundering directive, the provisions of which were transposed into Irish Law by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  Part 4 of the Act sets out the obligations in regard to customer identification for the purposes of the legislation.  These include the obligation to conduct customer due diligence prior to the establishment of a business relationship.  Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and the beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.  The extent to which a particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements is determined by reference to the Act, having regard to the underlying directives.<\/p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a designated person under the Act as they fall within the definition of a financial institution.  In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of prize bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.  The Act designates the Central Bank as the competent authority for financial services providers, with responsibility for monitoring them and taking measures that are necessary for the purposes of securing their compliance with the Act.  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.  In light of the above, the Minister for Finance is exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, whether exemptions available under the directive may be applied to small-value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.

In 2012 the Hungarian Government passed a law defining homelessness as an administrative offence, with the result that people who get caught sleeping on the street twice in six months can be punished with incarceration or monetary penalties that no homeless person could afford.  After the country's constitutional court annulled the law for violating the human dignity of the homeless, their legal certainty and their right to property, the constitution was changed in March to reinforce the political decision to criminalise homeless people.<\/p><p>I realise that Budapest's capacity has been stretched to its limits, but deep poverty needs to be cured rather than banned.  The United Nations has reported that an estimated 8,000 homeless people live in Budapest and between 30,000 and 35,000 are homeless in the country as a whole.  The unemployment rate in Hungary is 10.9%.  Homeless rights advocates have argued that shelters are overcrowded and are calling on the Hungarian Government to focus on providing affordable housing rather than temporary accommodation.  According to an independent research team called the Third of February Working Group, there were only 10,205 official beds for the homeless in 2012.  The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, human rights and the right to adequate housing has called on Hungary to revise its laws criminalising homelessness and stated that homeless persons should not be deprived of their basic rights to liberty, privacy, personal security and the protection of their family solely because they are poor and in need of shelter.<\/p><p>Hungary is obliged under the European Social Charter, the Council of Europe treaty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to vindicate the right to adequate housing.  The EU recognises the right to social housing and housing assistance in order to combat social exclusion and poverty, and in June 2010 it adopted the Europe 2020 strategy to promote social inclusion.<\/p><p>Homelessness is one of the most extreme forms of poverty and social deprivation.  This law is an unacceptable violation of human dignity.  The right to housing as set out in Article 31 of the revised European Social Charter should be guaranteed and Hungary should fulfil its obligations under Article 12.<\/p> <p>A policy of repression and criminalisation is no answer to social problems.  The Hungarian Government should revoke the law that makes it a crime to be homeless.  It raises serious human rights concerns and is very difficult to reconcile with Hungary's human rights obligations.  It defies logic to punish the poorest people in society just because they live on the streets.  Fines and imprisonment will do nothing to address the fundamental problems which lead to homelessness.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to set out the position Ireland is taking in respect of these laws, the deliberations he has undertaken with his Hungarian counterpart and whether the issue was raised during the Presidency, particularly in the context of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#VV00700","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  Unfortunately, the T&aacute;naiste is not in a position to attend the House and has asked me to take the matter.<\/p><p>The foreign Minister in Hungary, J&aacute;nos Martonyi , wrote to all EU foreign Ministers last March to inform them of changes to the Hungarian constitution which were subsequently approved by the Hungarian Parliament.  The changes have given rise to a number of concerns within the EU, the wider international community and civil society on the independence of the judiciary, particularly the constitutional court of Hungary.  There are also concerns about the possible curtailment of civil liberties.  In a joint statement dated 11 March 2013, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe expressed regret that their experts had not been afforded the opportunity to discuss the amendments with Hungarian officials before final approval.  They also raised concerns about whether the amendments to the Hungarian constitution respected the principle of the rule of law, EU law and Council of Europe standards.  The T&aacute;naiste expressed in the D&aacute;il Ireland's full support for the joint statement and encouraged the Hungarian Government to engage fully to ensure it meets its EU and international obligations.<\/p><p>The European Commission is conducting a detailed assessment of the amendment.  In April, President Barroso wrote to Hungary's Prime Minister to indicate that, on a first analysis, the Commission had serious concerns about the compatibility of the constitutional changes with EU legislation and the principle of the rule of law.  Also in April, during a debate on the constitutional situation in Hungary in the European Parliament, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, acting in her Presidency role, recalled the EU's basic values, which are set out in the treaty and also contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all EU member states are party.  She indicated that the promotion of the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights are important priorities and noted that equality, tolerance, respect for human rights and the rule of law are the values on which the European Union is founded.  Members of the European Parliament's LIBE committee are engaged in dialogue with Hungary and there is another important debate today in the EU Parliament in which the Hungarian Prime Minister is scheduled to participate.<\/p><p>The Council of Europe remains actively engaged on the matter, primarily through its Secretary General and advisory body on constitutional matters, the Venice Commission.  At the joint request of the Secretary General and Hungarian authorities, the Venice Commission recently adopted a detailed opinion on the implications of the fourth amendment to the Hungarian fundamental law in which it set out several concerns, including concerns on the homelessness issue as raised by Senator Reilly.  While indicating that there remains some difference of views in certain areas, Hungary has indicated that it will carefully examine the opinion and remains open for dialogue and co-operation.  We support fully the efforts being made by the EU, the Venice Commission and the European Parliament, among others, to engage with the Hungarian authorities on this matter.  We welcome the engagement that has been undertaken by the Hungarian authorities in recent months.  This has led to some proposed changes to be voted on by the Hungarian Parliament in autumn.<\/p><p>While all concerns have yet to be fully allayed, including on the homelessness issue, the process of consultation is continuing.  The Hungarian authorities have indicated that they are fully committed to dialogue with the relevant European and international institutions on these concerns.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and trust that the dialogue under way will lead to further changes which will address these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#WW00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Recruitment","time":1372779000,"counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#WW00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to the House and thank him for taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I have asked for this matter to be taken on the Adjournment to ask the Minister about the ongoing issue of retired teachers being re-employed in schools, often as substitute teachers or on a part-time basis.  I have also asked him to address the issue of retired teachers being employed by the State Examinations Commission to act as examiners in practical subjects and to supervise the State exams.<\/p><p>Figures released in 2012 revealed that 1,311 retired teachers were employed as supervisors in the State exams while only 726 non-permanent teachers were hired.  Since coming into Government, I understand that the Minister has committed with the Government to ensuring that unemployed and newly qualified teachers should be employed in schools where possible.  I am extremely disappointed that the figures released this year, however, reveal again that more than 1,000 retired teachers were employed to supervise the State examinations.  Of the 4,861 superintendents hired this year, almost 25%, or 1,049, were retired teachers, while just 250 unemployed teachers were hired.  These figures are worrying given that last year 3,365 people graduated as teachers.  I have inquired about these statistics before and been assured that newly qualified and unemployed teachers were prioritised this year.  However, I meet constantly with newly qualified teachers who have been unsuccessful in securing positions as superintendents.  I requested information as late as May 2013 on the number of retired teachers being employed as superintendents and am disappointed that I have yet to receive a formal reply.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would communicate my concerns to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to ensure that I get a response.  Meanwhile, I have read about the figures in the media and am disappointed not to have been supplied with them directly.<\/p><p>The TextaSub service which links schools to substitute teachers and can aid unemployed teachers in finding substitute positions is welcome, but it does not solve the problem.  For example, in my home county of Louth, just nine teachers are registered for the service.  As a former teacher and someone who is in communication with teachers in my home town, I am aware of the fact that there are many more than nine teachers in Louth who are seeking teaching positions.  Often, an unemployed teacher must move to a more urban area to seek any kind of employment.  They may not be living in the county and therefore cannot register for the service.  Every day, I am contacted by newly qualified and unemployed teachers who are desperate to find teaching employment.  They are graduates with excellent qualifications and skills, often past pupils who would make fantastic teachers and inject into their schools new ideas and teaching methods.  However, they are disillusioned to discover that even substitute cover is often offered to retired teachers.  I do not blame the Minister for this.  He has made progressive remarks and tried to counteract the trend.  The problem lies with certain schools which have a habit of employing retired teachers.<\/p><p>I had a worrying conversation with a former teacher recently.  He informed me quite proudly that he had been employed constantly to provide maternity cover and substitute teaching since his retirement.  I was informed recently of a teacher who was retiring this year.  The teacher in fact retired last year and was obviously taken back by the school on a part-time basis.  I find this extremely frustrating when we have newly qualified young graduates who do not want to leave the country.  They want to stay and give something back through their education and skills.<\/p> <p>Further examples of retired principals and deputy principals being employed to provide substitute cover or being employed as exam supervisors have been relayed to me by disillusioned graduates and the parents of graduates who have invested hard-earned money, energy and commitment to see children graduate as qualified teachers.  I ask the Minister of State to consider taking further measures to ensure newly qualified teachers and unemployed teachers are prioritised.  Schools have major autonomy in employing part-time and substitute teachers, as they do in the area of voluntary contributions and uniforms, which is another debate.  Perhaps the Minister of State can relay to the Minister the suggestion that we create a system whereby the Department decides who will provide substitute cover, illness cover and maternity cover in order to ensure a more fair and equitable system will be provided for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#WW00400","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator we have one thing in common in that we are both former teachers.  I have an understanding of the point the Senator is making.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who is in Cabinet at the moment.  The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State examinations.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has no role in the selection criteria for the appointment of superintendents of State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission has provided the following information.  Some 5,000 superintendents were appointed by the commission to almost 750 second level schools for the 2013 examinations.  This does not include almost 9,000 superintendents appointed locally by schools, mindful of the specific needs of each individual student, to supervise students with special educational needs.<\/p><p>In the main, the State Examinations Commission appoints experienced teachers as examination superintendents.  It is considered that teachers' classroom management skills and experience of working with young people are equally required for the effective conduct of the examination superintending duties.  In 2013 a further criterion for appointment was introduced by the State Examinations Commission in order to comply with the terms of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, whereby all applicants had to be on the register of teachers maintained by the Teaching Council.<\/p><p>There is a long-standing policy of appointing unemployed and substitute teachers before drawing on other applicants.  The State Examinations Commission highlighted this category of applicant when running the 2013 advertisement and recruitment campaign.  The number of unemployed teachers appointed rose to 250 from 190 in 2012 and the number of substitute teachers appointed rose to 716 from 429 in 2012.  Retired teachers may apply and be appointed in accordance with the terms of the Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment on a number of grounds, including age.  Following the removal of any upper age limit in 2005 as a consequence of the employment equality legislation, the number of retired teachers engaged as superintendents increased from 406 in 2006 to 1,458 in 2012, dropping to 1,049 in 2013.<\/p><p>The board of management of a school, in accordance with the provisions of the Education Acts, manages a school on behalf of the patron.  The board of management of a school, or the education training board, ETB, in the case of the ETB schools, is responsible for recruitment, selection, appointment, discipline and dismissal of staff.  Teachers and other staff are employed by the board of management or ETB.  The Minister is not a party to that contract.<\/p><p>I agree that priority should be given to unemployed teachers over those in receipt of pensions and the Department has taken the following steps in this regard.  Information notes were issued to schools in October 2009 and October 2010, which requested that schools prioritise unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension when appointing temporary teachers.  Circular 31\/2011 was issued to schools in May 2011 to ensure, as far as practicable, that people appointed to teach are registered teachers with qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are employed and that unemployed teachers are offered employment in preference to those who have retired.  It required each school to keep a list of appropriately qualified registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice.  This list must not include the names of registered teachers in receipt of pension in respect of service given under a public service pension scheme.  It also obliged the principal to keep a record and report to the board of management any instances when retired registered teachers and unregistered persons are employed.  The Department has also engaged with a number of schools who show up on the Department's payroll as employing retired teachers.<\/p><p>During the period of the written examinations each June, much of the integrity of the examination process depends on the manner in which superintendents perform their assigned tasks.  It is a critical role and one that has been performed with excellence, skill and dedication by thousands of superintendents over the years.  Superintendents have a range of important duties over a three week period in June.  These include the safe custody of the examination papers, the safe custody of completed examination scripts and the safe and proper conduct of each day's examinations in line with the rules and procedures laid down by the State Examinations Commission.<\/p><p>The question of appointments of superintendents of State examinations is obviously an operational one.  The State Examinations Commission is the body charged with the running of the State examinations and the focus of the greatest expertise in that regard.  It makes perfect sense that this operational matter should be fully within the remit of the State Examinations Commission.<\/p><p>The Minister will refer the detailed issues raised in this debate to the commission for its information and consideration.  Since September 2010, the recruitment of teachers by schools strongly favours unemployed teachers over those in receipt of pension.  Under Circular 0040\/2011 and subsequently circular 0008\/2013, teachers who are retired and who return to teaching were remunerated at the first point of the revised salary scales applicable to new entrants at the date of re-entry.  This represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.

I wish to discuss the need for urgent accommodation for the Priorswood outreach service, Sphere 17.  This service provides a wide range of services for young people from Darndale, Bonnybrook and Priorswood areas of Dublin 17, which is one of the most socially disadvantaged parts of the whole country.  Last year, the service worked with over 1,250 people between the ages of ten and 21.  It is a huge service and, through its programmes, Sphere 17 provides positive and enjoyable ways for young people to spend their time, provides a drop in service where teenagers can play pool and hang out with their friends in an alcohol-free environment throughout the year, and provides young people with opportunities to engage in arts programmes and other initiatives they would otherwise not have.<\/p> <p>They do hugely important health promotion work, running alcohol and drug awareness and teen pregnancy programmes.  They also undertake mental health initiatives, which are important, particularly for at risk young people, and a wide range of other important initiatives.  Through all this, they help to improve young people's self-esteem and confidence in themselves and encourage them to avail of opportunities in school and elsewhere, to believe in themselves and to build a better future.  The team covers three areas - Darndale, Priorswood and Bonnybrook.<\/p><p>The team in Priorswood provides an incredible service but the staff are working in incredibly bad physical conditions.  They work out of a portakabin, which was only ever intended to be short-term accommodation.  It is in a dreadful state, having been run down over the years.  It is currently closed because it was broken into yet again.  It is a particularly vulnerable building.  It is easy to break into and it cannot be used at the moment.  The staff are managing to cope with the summer programmes because, apart from today's horrendous weather, they have been lucky with the weather.  They have been able to put on initiatives outdoors but that will not be a possibility heading into the winter.  They badly need a new purpose built, secure building to replace the portakabin to provide this valuable service.<\/p><p>They have raised &euro;55,000 with great effort and they are seeking &euro;100,000 under the youth cafe capital programme.  I wrote to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about this a number of months ago.  I  understand the application is being considered but the reason I tabled this matter is to draw her attention to the application again.  I appreciate many groups have applied for this funding but there is a particularly urgent need in this area because the present accommodation is in such bad condition and it cannot even be used now because of the recent break-in.  This is an urgent issue.  This is an excellent organisation with a fantastic track record.  The staff will make sure every euro they are given in funding will be well spent and it will enable them to continue to provide a great quality service for young people in the Priorswood area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#XX00500","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who is attending a Government meeting.<\/p><p>The Minister is conscious of the great benefits that can accrue to our young people from involvement in youth work and the benefits for society as a whole.  Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision-making, motivation, and self-responsibility can be acquired in a learning by doing manner.  The aim of the youth service is to assist all young people to become active participants in a democratic society.  In essence, the primary objective of the youth service is to help realise the potential of each young person and to facilitate their full participation in community life.<\/p><p>The youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  Funding of some &euro;53.498 million is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at-risk young people are provided through the youth service grant scheme, the special projects for youth, SPY, scheme, the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF,  rounds 1 and 2 and local drugs task force, LDFT projects, youth information centres as well as other initiatives such as the local youth club grant scheme.  The focus of this financial support in 2013, as in previous years, is on the consolidation of existing youth work provision and on the safeguarding of front-line programmes, particularly in disadvantaged communities.<\/p><p>The Minister is very much aware of the valuable services provided by Sphere 17 regional youth service to young people aged between ten and 21 years in areas such as Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood in Dublin 17.  Sphere 17 provides young people with a wide range of programmes and activities, seven days a week which reflect their needs, interests, capacity and age profile.  These programmes and activities include personal and social development with a particular focus on recreation, education and health.  Projects engage with young people in an open, creative and health focused way using a variety of youth friendly approaches.  A team of trained and dedicated staff works with and for young people in the Dublin 17 area supporting them to achieve their potential and contribute positively to their communities.  The Department provides funding to Sphere 17 regional youth service under a number of funding schemes.  These are the SPY scheme, YPFSF rounds 1 and 2 and the LDTF.  Funding of &euro;788,839 has been allocated to Sphere 17 in 2013.<\/p><p>The overall budget of &euro;53.498 million for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 includes capital funding of &euro;1.75 million.  Of this funding up to &euro;1 million is available for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the start-up of new youth cafes.  A total of 95 applications was received under the youth cafe scheme this year, which is being administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department understands that an application for capital funding under this scheme was received from Sphere 17.  The initial appraisal process of the applications received is in the final stages.  It is expected that applications that are successful will go through to the next round of the process and will be notified in the coming weeks.  The final decisions about youth cafes to be funded under this scheme will be made at the end of October 2013.  Details of the application process for the remaining youth capital funding which amounts to &euro;500,000 in 2013 will be available in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200020#YY00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The main purpose of amendment No. 1 which I hope will be welcomed is to extend, for human trafficking offences, existing rules that make it easier for children to give evidence in criminal prosecutions.  Article 15.4 of the EU human trafficking directive provides that member states shall take the necessary measures to ensure that in criminal prosecutions of human trafficking offences all interviews with a child victim or, where appropriate, a child witness may be video recorded and that such video-recorded interviews may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.  For the purposes of the directive, a child is any person below the age of 18 years.  Amendment No. 1 effects two significant changes to section 16(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 in respect of human trafficking offences.  First, to comply with the directive, it increases, from 14 to 18 years, the upper age threshold for out-of-court video recording of a complainant's evidence.  Second, the amendment also applies to a child witness, other than the accused, who is under the age of 18 years.<\/p><p>  While the scope of the amendment is limited to human trafficking offences, the extension of child evidence rules in the Bill is the first phase of plans for a wider extension of the rules.  There are provisions similar to Article 15.4 of the human trafficking directive in an EU directive on combating sexual abuse and exploitation and also in the EU directive on victims' rights.<\/p><p>  The other elements of amendment No. 1 are of a consequential nature.  The amendments to section 15 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 provide for consequential changes to the rules of criminal procedure.  At present, the prosecution must give notice to the accused that it is intended to give evidence in the form of an out-of-court video-recorded statement of a victim under the age of 14 years and give the accused an opportunity of viewing the video recording.  The amendments to section 15 extend this requirement to reflect the new categories of child witness whose evidence can be video recorded out of court.  Section 19 of the 1992 Act cross-references other provisions in that Act so as to apply rules relating to child evidence to vulnerable persons under 18 or 14 years, as the case may be.  The amendment to section 19 adjusts these references to reflect the new categories of child witness whose evidence can be video recorded out of court.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 2 makes a consequential change to the Long Title of the Act.  <\/p><p>  These are significant and worthwhile developments in assisting child victims of human trafficking offences in criminal investigations and proceedings.  I hope Senators will support them and I commend them to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200021#X00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372779600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p>I support these amendments to the Bill.

I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing on prevention and, hopefully, broadening the net.  I compliment the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on its recently published report and recommendations.  The most notable recommendation is to criminalise the purchase of sexual services by another person by means of prostitution or any request, agreement or attempt to do so.  The proposal should be clarified to ensure that no offence is committed by the person whose sexual services are sold.  The Minister has something to consider in that regard.  The amendments made by the D&aacute;il, particularly the amendment to section 4, are very positive.  I will speak on that later.<\/p><p>International co-operation on trafficking is very important.  We must ensure that the national referral mechanism works to its full capacity. The Minister is co-operating in that context with non-governmental organisations.  The mechanism is working well but could be strengthened further.  I was in Romania at the weekend to attend a meeting of parliamentarians against human trafficking.  A recommendation that emerged from the meeting was that every border agency should ensure full co-operation among all agencies.  I was alarmed to read during the week the comments of PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggot on the proposed national crime agency in the North to combat crime, including trafficking, across the Border.  Trafficking has no boundaries.  The Chief Constable said lives would be put at risk by curtailing the powers of the national crime agency.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP who blocked the initiative in the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in should ensure there is the fullest co-operation with all agencies of the Assembly and of this State so that policing operations work closely with those in the south of Ireland.  Constable Matt Baggott said there would be huge restrictions and lives would be at risk.  He expressed concerns that this was not given full support by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP.  The reason given was that they feared there was not enough transparency.  What transparency exists in trafficking?  There is very little; it is all hidden.  We must do all in our power to ensure there is full transparency.

I thank the Department for the help given to the BIPA committee on trafficking.  The European project of a common language and a dictionary of common terms used in trafficking, so that we are all using the same terminology across Europe, is important.

It is important that nothing be done to impede or prevent co-operation or to dilute the focus on targeting individuals engaged in trafficking.  What is particularly important is that we provide protection for individuals who have been trafficked and that we encourage and work with them to provide necessary information and evidence, North and South, to facilitate appropriate prosecutions while ensuring that those who are the victims of human trafficking do not feel intimidated in any way should they need to give evidence in our courts.

He was probably busy tabling his own amendments and I will take that on board.<\/p><p>  We have another suggestion regarding accreditation of the press when reporting in the context of the Bill.  It is an issue.  If anybody wants to report on a gig or a GAA football match or even the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a system of accreditation is in place.  For example, the Oireachtas will not allow any old journalists or a student with an NUJ card to walk in and report on the workings of the Houses nor would they get into the All-Ireland Final in Croke Park.  It is not a complicated system to put in place but the benefits of having a system of accreditation in the courts would be useful.  The amendment states:<blockquote>&quot;Bona fide representatives of the Press, in order to be permitted to attend proceedings referred to in subsection (1), shall be required to provide accreditation of the form prescribed in paragraph (b).<br \/>(b) Accreditation for the purposes of paragraph (a) shall be provided by the Court Reporting Accreditation Committee, which shall consist of the following ordinary members:<br \/>(i) a representative of the Press Council,<br \/>(ii) a representative of the Press Ombudsman's Office,<br \/>(iii) a representative of the Department of Justice and Equality, and<br \/>(iv) a representative of the Children's Ombudsman's office,<br \/>and the Minister for Justice and Equality shall also appoint a judge of the High Court as the chair of the Courts Reporting Accreditation Committee. The Courts Reporting Accreditation Committee shall operate on the basis of majority decision, and in the event of a tied decision among the ordinary members, the chair of the committee shall have the casting vote.<br \/>(c) Bona fide representatives of the Press, without accreditation as provided for in subsections (a) and (b) shall be prohibited from attending proceedings referred to in subsection (1).<br \/>(d) Subject to subsection (c), nothing contained in this section shall operate to prohibit bona fide representatives of the Press from attending proceedings referred to in subsection (1). <br \/>(e) Subject to paragraphs (f) and (g), where, in proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so<br \/> --&#8221;.<\/blockquote>  We are suggesting a simple procedure to be followed.  On Committee Stage, a number of Members said one would expect the judge to know the members of the press in the gallery.  That would not be a prudent way to go about this.  I have worked in the media for a number of years.<\/p> <p>It is not very difficult to get a NUJ card or even to have a NUJ card in a probationary position.  If someone has a valid NUJ card, he or she could easily argue to the person at the door of the courthouse that he or she should be allowed to come into the court and report on the proceedings.<\/p><p>It is not prudent to think a judge in Galway, for example, would know anybody from Galway who potentially has a NUJ card.  I could name hundreds of people in Galway who have either done media degrees or are bona fide journalists working in journalism on a daily basis and who would have a NUJ card.  Also, there might be a situation where the people involved in the case are from different areas or counties.  If, for example, one of the parties is from Dublin, somebody in the press in Dublin might be interested in the case and present at a courthouse in Galway to report on it in a bona fide way in their medium.<\/p><p>What we are proposing is a practical measure.  It would not be over-onerous.  It simply calls for an accreditation system to be put in place.  I realise the Minister has many amendments to deal with, but this is a genuine attempt to bring forward an amendment that would be workable and practical but which would put safeguards in place in order that there would be responsible journalism in cases of this nature.  I hope he will accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200024#AA01600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372781100,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  As I said last week, the move towards greater transparency in the reporting of family law cases is good.  There has been far too much secrecy and at times it has undermined people's faith in the system unnecessarily.  It is good to have more reporting.  However, it is important - this is the objective of the Bill - that this be done in a responsible way, that there be adequate protection for privacy and anonymity in sensitive family law cases and that members of the press who report on such cases abide by these principles and ensure any reporting on child protection, divorce and other sensitive family law cases is appropriate, respectful and done in a responsible way.<\/p><p>This is a very positive amendment.  The process proposed is sensible and not overly cumbersome.  I agree with Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on whether a judge would know whether somebody was a member of the press and would know what was the most appropriate form of identity to seek.  Would it simply be a NUJ card or would more be required in such a sensitive case?  I do not believe most judges would like to be put in that position.  It would be sensible to have a simple process which journalists could go through to be vetted and receive accreditation.  That is the case for sports events and in reporting on proceedings in this House.  In the case of the most basic conference a journalist wishes to attend, he or she must register in advance and receive accreditation.  That should be the least we should expect in reporting on family law cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200025#BB00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1372781100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for proposing the amendment.  I deliberate in a deliberate and focused manner and was conscious of this issue.  We might be dealing with this Stage at some speed, but obviously these are issues that were given consideration during the drafting of the various provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>I agree that there must be very careful rules regarding the publishing of material about family law and child care cases.  As Senator Averil Power said, it is important that cases be reported carefully and responsibly and that there be sufficient insight on the part of journalists to ensure that in their reportage they do not reveal identities or other information.  Of course, there are specific provisions in the Bill that seek to ensure this does not occur.  As I said on the last occasion, it would be useful if, following the enactment of the legislation, there could be an agreed protocol with and between media outlets on how they will report family and child care cases to ensure there is a degree of consistency in the non-disclosure of sensitive information or any other information that could identify individuals.  This has worked well in the context of the reporting of criminal prosecutions for sexual offences and where such reports are made by bona fide members of the media, there has been no major difficulty arising as to whether an individual is a bona fide member of the media.<\/p> <p>The Bill does not take a prescriptive approach to regulating the members of the media who may or may not be permitted access to relevant child care, family law and adoption proceedings.  The Bill leaves it to the court to allow bona fide members of the media to be present in certain circumstances.  It is a matter for the individual judge to be satisfied as to the bona fide nature of a representative of the press in this respect. <\/p><p>I reiterate that where this terminology has been used in other circumstances in respect of court proceedings it has not given rise, in practice, to any major difficulty of which I am aware.  As I said, the same approach is used in many legislative provisions and they also use the term &quot;bone fide representatives of the press&quot;.  If that term has allowed for matters to be reported in a matter that preserves people's anonymity and does not provide for the disclosure of information that would be an identifying feature in serious sexual offences when they are taken to court and prosecuted, there is no reason for it to give rise to any unexpected difficulty in dealing with family law matters.  The experience to date is that the approach works well.  I believe it is the correct approach in the circumstances of these provisions also.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I do not intend to accept the amendment, but I hope a protocol might be agreed with the media with regard to consistency in reporting and the protection of people's identities.  I think that would be a desirable thing.  It is my hope and expectation that the reporting of such proceedings will be undertaken with a degree of responsibility.  Of course, if reporting occurs that identifies individuals, that will constitute an offence under the legislation and will create a particular difficulty for the reporter and media outlet that so breach the legislation. <\/p><p>I would expect that there would be care and caution in the use of this.  Of course, if a difficulty arises that is not anticipated at the moment we will always have recourse, if needs be, to further changes in the law.  I am very conscious that this is a new departure in family proceedings.  Whereas I think it is desirable that we bring transparency to this area, the legislative structure we have provided is a very cautious one.  It gives rise to myriad circumstances in which the press may still be excluded from reporting particular family, child care or adoption proceedings, including circumstances in which it is in the best interests of the child that this occurs.  <\/p><p>This is a very careful approach because I am conscious, as someone who has worked in this area, of the huge importance of ensuring no barrier is placed in the way of individuals having their personal issues addressed in the courts and that there is no fear that matters of very personal nature could get publicity for sensational reasons where there is no real public interest in their reportage.  One bit of me has a reluctance to go down this road for fear that it may well be abused, but I think there is an overwhelming case for greater transparency so that people who use our court system have some understanding of how family proceedings take place, that there is some transparency in how justice is administered and that there are some insights into the approach taken and the consistency in that approach.  That may also be of assistance to Members of this House as legislators in determining on occasions whether laws as enacted are working as envisaged or whether there is a need for reform because the original intent of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not necessarily reflected in the manner in which cases are being heard and determined.  This a very sensitive and difficult area of the law which causes great emotional stress to any individual who finds himself or herself coming into our courts, particularly in circumstances of family breakdown, child care issues or conflicts in adoption cases, which can give rise to a great deal of stress and understandable emotion. <\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this.  It is a seriously intended amendment.  It is important that we tease these issues out.  It is important, as I have said on other occasions, that we acknowledge none of us has a monopoly on wisdom.<\/p> <p>However, the creation of the type of committee the Senator is suggesting could result in bona fide individuals assigned to report on family law proceedings having to go through a labyrinthine procedure or unnecessary delays before they can have access to the courts to report properly and responsibly on these matters.  That is a cause for concern.<\/p><p>The proposal in this amendment has not proved necessary in the reporting of serious criminal sexual offences in our courts, and I do not consider it necessary for the reportage of family law.  Any judge hearing a family case who sees a person sitting in the court will be in a position to query that individual's presence and to seek a validation, if need be and if there is any suggestion otherwise, that he or she is a member of the press.  The likelihood is, as is the case at present in other court proceedings, that reporters in family cases will be well known to the court clerks, registrars and judges because they are regularly reporting matters before the courts.  It is very unlikely that there will be myriad different reporters descending on the court system on different days.  As it stands, a large number of cases are litigated in the criminal and civil areas on a day-to-day basis, the vast majority of which never see the light of day in newspaper reports.  Only a minority will generate coverage by either the broadcast or print media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200025#BB00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372781700,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am disappointed, however, that he will not take on board this amendment.  Some of the arguments he advanced actually strengthen the case for our proposal.  He acknowledged that this is a new departure in the law and that many of the cases involved are very sensitive.  This proposal would provide an additional layer of safety for the persons involved.  The Minister notes that it will be a criminal offence to breach the guidelines or the spirit of the legislation.  For the people who are victimised by that breach, however, by way, for instance, of a media report which names people it should not or gives details that should not be given, any action in that regard may well be too late.  Although we have a very responsible media in general in this country, we have seen how unscrupulous media outlets in other jurisdictions, not very far away, will pick up on the salacious details of these types of cases in an effort to sell newspapers.  That is precisely what we are anxious to avoid.<\/p><p>I do not agree that the procedure outlined in our amendment would be over-cumbersome.  I am aware of organisations which have an annual procedure whereby court reporters must apply for the relevant accreditation.  There is also the question of the time a judge might have to spend in ascertaining whether persons sitting in the courtroom are bona fide journalists.  An annual process of accreditation which furnishes journalists with a form of identification that can be presented for inspection would provide an easy and speedy means for the clerk or other official to verify their identity.  I appreciate where the Minister is coming from on this issue and acknowledge the extent of his experience in this area.  I remain of the view, however, that this provision would provide an additional safety valve, so to speak, in the context of this new departure in court proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200027#DD00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372781700,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200027#DD00500","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 7:\r\nIn page 21, lines 10 and 11, to delete &quot;additional jurors have been sworn in the trial of a\r\ncriminal issue pursuant to&quot; and substitute &quot;jurors have been sworn in the trial of a criminal issue following the making of&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372781700,"counter":490,"content":"<p>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that these technical drafting amendments are necessary to improve the clarity of section 23.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200027#DD00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 8:\r\nIn page 21, line 33, to delete &quot;additional jurors have been selected pursuant to&quot; and substitute &quot;jurors have been selected following the making of an order under&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372781700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200027#DD01100","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372781700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 9:\r\nIn page 26, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:&quot;(b) by the insertion of the following definition:&quot;'Director' means the Director of the Insolvency Service;&quot;,&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372781700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>This amendment inserts the definition of \"Director\" in section 3 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 into the Bill.<\/p> <p>The definition is necessary for the interpretation of the Act, given the transfer of responsibility for the office of the official assignee in bankruptcy to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 corrects an error in the text.

Last Wednesday on Committee Stage, I outlined in great detail the rationale and urgency behind my amendment, and I do not propose to do so again today because we are all here.  I have conducted extensive legislative analysis on my proposal, which I believe strikes the appropriate balance between the right of the accused to procedural fairness and the right of the child witness to privacy and personal dignity.  Without ready access to legislative drafters, it is difficult to translate a legitimate and necessary reform such as this into a legislative proposal, and I thank the Minister for his critique of my amendment on Committee Stage.  It has given me this opportunity, albeit with an extremely short turnaround time, to revert with a more robust amendment that I urge him to accept today.<\/p><p>  The Minister's primary concern on core procedure is very valid.  I have altered the wording to allow the matter to be considered pre-trial.  I have also added a reference to the rule of court to allow for further regulation of the application process by way of an amendment to the rules of court, should the Minister or the court rules committee find it necessary to do so.  For example, the rules could set out a prescribed form for such applications, time limits and so on.<\/p><p>  I noted the Minister's concerns in respect of the qualifications of a counsellor and clarity as to whom communication should be regarded as confidential.  It is unwise to specify any particular credential for counsellors.  This is partly due to the wide range of training and education approaches in the area.  More important is the avoidance of a situation where communication made by a child in confidence is disclosed simply because the counsellor did not pass all the exams, or passed the wrong kind of exams.  The regulation of the counselling profession is an important question, but there is a danger of allowing a preoccupation with credentials to distract from the purpose of this amendment.  However, to address the Minister's concern, I have added the following short provision which allows the Minister to refine, by way of statutory instrument, the definition of &quot;counselling&quot; and &quot;counsellor&quot;, while allowing the amendment to proceed.<\/p><p>  The amendment I have proposed states that the Minister &quot;may by order set out detailed criteria regarding the conduct of sexual assault counselling, and the training or qualifications of those who provide sexual assault counselling for the purposes of this Act.&quot;  I also noted the points the Minister made about the word &quot;encouragement&quot;.  While I believe it is a remote concern, I have removed the word from the section.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for his letter following the Committee Stage debate and I would like to address some of the points he raised therein.  He said that any proposal should address the rights of an adult as well as child complainants, and that immediate action is required, and as such he has decided to deal with the issue in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill.  In my Committee Stage intervention, I stressed the urgent to address the issue of third party disclosure of confidential records for adults complainants.  I know that there is a considerable amount of work being done by interested members, including myself and Senator Bacik, and by advocacy groups, and I welcome the Minister's commitment to act.  However, I do not see any justification for not proceeding with a legislative solution for children immediately in this Bill, as opposed to the sexual offences Bill, for which the heads have not yet been approved by the Government.  In February 2012 I brought forward a motion on child abuse material, and at that point I was promised it would be in the sexual offences Bill that would be published shortly.  I hope the Minister can understand that this is a very real and pertinent issue that is being dealt with at the moment.  Every child has the right to protection from harm, abuse and exploitation, including from criminal justice arrangements.<\/p><p>  As an aside, I must raise the experience of child victims of sexual abuse and the criminal justice system about repeated interviewing by separate agencies, most commonly in the context of parallel Garda investigations alongside a child protection investigation.  The attendant risk of further trauma and upset for a child in this context can be avoided by joint interviewing, which is done in other countries.  From a legal perspective, limiting the number of times a child is interviewed will reduce the potential for the type of contamination of a child's recollections of events which can lead to the failure to secure a conviction.<\/p><p>  We need effective co-ordination and training of garda&iacute; and social workers interviewing child victims of sexual abuse.  I note the arrangements in place for this in our neighbouring jurisdictions, such as the UK, in achieving best evidence, video interviews and the detailed, recommended practice for interviewing child witnesses in the latest edition of &quot;Achieving best evidence in criminal proceedings, Guidance on interviewing victims and witnesses, Guidance on using special measures&quot; and &quot;Guidance on joint interviewing of child witnesses in Scotland in 2011.&quot;<\/p><p>  I have already pointed out that there has been a notable increase in requests from the DPP's office seeking access to therapists' notes of children's private and confidential therapy sessions over the last six to 12 months.  That is a very real issue right now.  As an independent office, I appreciate that the Minister cannot directly instruct the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to revise its practice in this area.  There is no time to waste in introducing legislative guidelines.  I also appreciate the need for a solution that is workable from both a prosecution and defence perspective, but the arrangements proposed do not affect in any way the disclosure of material evidence or evidence relevant to a criminal trial.  The issue has been raised on a number of occasions, most recently in 2010 by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who is the Government appointed special<i> rapporteur<\/i> on child protection.  He stressed the urgent need for legislation then.  That was three years ago and no legislation has come forward.<\/p><p>  I do not have the legislative drafters that the Minister has at his disposal and the advice that he receives.  I do not need it for this amendment today in the Seanad, but it is not good enough that this will be promised in a Bill in the near future.  This is about children at the moment whose records are being handed over.  Parents have told me they are not sending their child to counselling because of this situation.  We have an obligation to do something.  I appreciate the Minister understands this issue as much as I do; probably more so from dealing with cases.  I have put this amendment forward in good faith and I have tried to get the balancing right.  I am willing to go back and work on this.  If it has to be brought through in the D&aacute;il, I have no difficulty with that.  It is not about my name, but about the children in these cases.  We have seen the increase in the DPP requests in the last six to 12 months.  This issue is escalating rather than going away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200029#FF01700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1372782900,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; mollta.  I would like to second the amendment.  We had a very comprehensive debate on the issue last week and I was hoping that the Minister might bring forward an amendment on it.  Last week, Senator van Turnhout showed that she had done a huge amount of research in the area.  She spoke a lot about NGOs.<\/p> <p>We raised issues between us which we have been discussing with other NGOs, such as the Rape Crisis Centre.  They have genuine concerns that the law is stacked against the victim in many cases and that the fear of coming forward to give information is increased by allowing access to notes from private therapy sessions.

As Senator van Turnhout said, there is a real concern that there are an increasing number of requests for disclosure made by defence teams.  Having worked in criminal defence at the Bar for some years, I noted there can be an increased tendency among defence counsels to undermine the evidence of complainants by way of a fishing exercise in seeking disclosure of their therapy sessions.  I accept it can be relevant in some cases but there is a concern that this is having a detrimental effect on complainants and their families.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated it is important the Attorney General would review the issues involved.  Clearly, there has to be regard for the due-process rights of the accused.  It is to be welcomed that the Law Reform Commission will undertake a review of this area of the law.  The Minister is correct that all of these issues should be codified in one Bill dealing with sex offences.  I have said before that it is unfortunate that so many of our provisions on sex offences are contained in many piecemeal Bills.  In principle, it would be much better if a provision on the disclosure of therapy and counselling notes in sex offence trials would also be contained in one Bill.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s point about delays is an important one.  It would be welcome if the Minister would review some limited form of amendment in the other House dealing with the specific issue of particular rules on the admissibility of evidence where the complainant is still under 18.  We have very specific provisions and protections around the provision of evidence by child witnesses.  For example, I have visited the excellent facilities for child witnesses in the new Criminal Courts of Justice building, a significant improvement to those in the Four Courts building.  If we were to make a special provision for the more restricted rule on disclosure of evidence in cases where the complainant is under 18, it would more likely withstand constitutional scrutiny than if it were a more general provision.  If we were to examine international conventions and case law, we would find more support for this special rule.<\/p><p>If the Minister cannot accept this amendment, will he consider a more refined version dealing with child complainants and the disclosure of counselling records to be taken in the D&aacute;il?  This might be a way of dealing with the particular concerns so eloquently expressed by Senator van Turnhout and those expressed to me by counsellors and those working in the Rape Crisis Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200030#GG00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1372783500,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Again, I want to thank Senator van Turnhout for raising this matter.  It is one on which, in principle, we are all agreed.  The issue is how we address it appropriately.  On Committee Stage, I said we should deal with it as speedily as possible.  I did point out that the issue is complex and requires careful consideration to ensure any proposal in this area correctly balances the constitutional right of the accused to due process along with the privacy rights of the complainant.  The Attorney General has advised me that a detailed examination is required to precisely identify and provide for the rights concerned.<\/p><p>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider whether it would feasible to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage or on D&aacute;il Committee Stage that could satisfactorily address the issue.  It is intended to complete the Bill&rsquo;s passage before the Houses rise for the summer vacation.  I have decided in such circumstances that there is, unfortunately, not enough time to comprehensively address this issue with the careful consideration required.  I have come to this conclusion because I believe further consultation is necessary with interested parties to bring forward a robust and workable solution.  I also want to allow time for full consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure any proposal put forward will work in practice to protect the rights concerned and ensure the effectiveness of the prosecution process.  I am also concerned that any proposal in this regard should be comprehensive and address the rights of adult as well as child complainants.<\/p><p>The examination and consultation on this subject, proposed by the Law Reform Commission, would be a suitable way of examining this complex issue.  I am conscious that the timeframe for such an examination is not appropriate and more immediate action is required.  Accordingly, I have decided this issue will be addressed in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill.  I am conscious this legislation has not yet been published due to other areas of legislation we have been addressing and the pressure on the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  However, it is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I expect the Bill to be before the Cabinet after the summer vacation and to be published at the end of October at the latest.<\/p><p>I believe this is the correct approach to ensure a suitable legislative solution is found as soon as possible to resolve the issue.  I hope the House will understand I cannot accept the amendment, not because I reject its purpose or value, but because the subject demands a fuller examination.  The difficulties in addressing this area are seen by the very helpful approach Senator van Turnhout has taken.<\/p> <p>We now have a new version of this proposal.  That is not a criticism of it.  Senator van Turnhout has tried to address some of the issues I raised of difficulty and complexity.  I welcome that and thank her for the work she has done on the provision that we now have.  I do not want to take up the House's time going through it in detail.  One of the issues I raised the last day, for example, was that this would be better as a pretrial procedure in the most cases.  Senator van Turnhout has prescribed it in those circumstances but I did say that, for example, during the course of an actual trial an issue could arise which would indicate that perhaps it would be legitimate for notes to be made available.  This provision does not envisage that.  I understand it does not because of the complexities involved.  This is not easy to draft.  There is also the question of treating the accused equally with regard to sexual offences.  Despite all of my concerns in addressing this in respect of children, I do think that, for example, an adult could be charged with the rape of a 17 year old or of a 19 year old and have different evidential rules in place with regard to the disclosure of information.  That could generate a difficulty in the criminal law area and might create constitutional problems.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik has highlighted another issue which we did not touch on the last time we discussed this Bill.  That discussion envisaged, although we did not all necessarily put it this way, a sexual prosecution taking place in circumstances where the court hearing occurred at a time when the alleged victim was still a child, not when the victim was an adult.  There is great complexity, a lot of law, a lot of court judgments and a lot of difficulty, for example, in validating allegations of sexual assault going back over the past 20 years.  In other jurisdictions it has arisen that someone in their 30s or 40s has gone through a form of counselling and perhaps that individual had difficulties in his or her life and retrospectively realised he or she was sexually assaulted at the age of eight or nine or 12 or 13.  There is a lot of literature about genuine memories and recollections or people being conditioned into recalling or believing events occurred in their lives that may not have occurred.<\/p><p>I can well understand Senator Bacik&rsquo;s approach in saying that perhaps this should apply only in circumstances in which at the time of the prosecution the alleged victim is a child but we do not live in a black and white world.  What happens if the prosecution is initiated when the victim is a child but becomes an adult before the case is put to trial?  We need an all-encompassing rule in this area that deals with the issue of access to these notes, whether the victim is or was at the time of the assault and prosecution a child, or whether the victim was a child at the time of the alleged offence but is an adult at the time of the trial, or whether the victim first said an offence occurred 20 years after becoming an adult.<\/p><p>We need a consistent and careful legal architecture that seeks to ensure that people who seek counselling are not presented with barriers but seeks also to ensure that there is due process where an accusation is made, and that, on the other side, we have the balance of protecting people's privacy, the need and right they have to have access to help, be it psychological, psychiatric or counselling of another nature, following being a victim in this area.  Unfortunately, this is a complicated issue.  It is best that we address it comprehensively and that we engage in, and complete, a consultative process.  It is my intention that we address it in this sexual offences Bill.<\/p><p>I could well conceive that because the Bill is so advanced we would be at a point where we could publish it as heads of a Bill before we finalise it in the way we have done, where this particular matter has not been completed but work on it will continue and be completed before we publish the Bill in final form.  That could well be the case but I want to assure Members of the House that I do take this issue seriously.  I am of course aware of Geoffrey Shannon's 2010 report on this issue.  I recall raising it when I was in opposition and I hope we get the opportunity to address it.  I genuinely thank Senator van Turnhout for what has been an important discussion, one which has probably contributed to ensuring that the matter is not delayed until the Law Reform Commission addresses it but that we do address it within the Bill.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout made a very important point in talking about the impact, particularly on children, of repeated interviews by different agencies.  That is an issue on which I know there is supposed to be a co-ordinated approach.  Repetitive interviews are supposed to be avoided.  I will discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the approach taken by the HSE and the new child protection agency, when it is in place, to these matters and the coordinated and cooperative nature of Garda involvement where it is required.  There are of course occasions when interviews take place on the social service side, which may involve child protection issues at a time when it may not be immediately clear that garda&iacute; need to be present, or at a time when their presence might be counter-productive.  Garda&iacute; may be present and there may be a need on occasion for the HSE to refer the matter to the Garda.  There will be instances in the future when it is impossible that there be one set of interviews by social services and members of the Garda.  I will also raise this issue with the Garda Commissioner to see, where it is possible, that repetitive interviews be avoided so that a young person who has suffered a trauma and been the victim of an alleged assault does not have consistently to relive that experience.<\/p><p>I am, nevertheless, also cognisant of the fact that not all information necessarily comes out in an initial interview, that individuals may be traumatised, that they may be able only to give limited information but if the problem could result in a criminal law process, in order for that process to take place and for a Garda file to be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, it may well be necessary for a young person, who is the victim of a sexual assault, to be interviewed on more than one or two occasions so that there is clarity about the nature of his or her description of events.  Alternatively, if issues arise during the course of an investigation it can well occur that the alleged victim must again be consulted and further questions may arise to ensure that the full background is understood and any inconsistencies that emerge are addressed so that if a file is sent to the DPP it contains the fullest and most comprehensive information possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200030#GG00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372784100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It started off as a relatively modest courts Bill.  In the context of the myriad issues that I am anxious we address and the reforms that I want to see implemented, it has proved, because having published it we let it sit for some time to give different groups and individuals an opportunity to consider its contents and make submissions on it, particularly in the matter of the reporting on family and child care cases, to be a useful legislative vehicle to try to address some other reforming issues.  There were still others that I had hoped we might be able to deal with, but, unfortunately, that did not prove possible in the timeframe involved.<\/p><p>I can tell Senator Jillian van Turnhout that I can guarantee that we will have another civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill sometime in the next 12 months to address a number of other issues, in respect of which I have got bees in my bonnet, that I want to reform and that affect important areas but to which we could not devote a Bill on its own.  There are one or two further amendments to the Insolvency Act that we did not have ready for the Seanad that I expect we will introduce in the D&aacute;il, which means that this Bill will revisit this House for a short time following its progress through the D&aacute;il.  I am not sure whether the Attorney General will put up with my adding any subject matter to it.  I do not think we will do this.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their very careful and detailed consideration of all the provisions in the Bill.  At its heart, the Bill is important, from its starting point.  It will have a dramatic impact on the courts system and we are effecting very important reforms.  For 20 years the jurisdictional basis of the courts and civil proceedings has remained unchanged.  No notice has been taken of the increase in the cost of living.  The reality is that today the District Court has, because of the increase in monetary values, a far more restrictive jurisdiction than it had in 1991, which is bizarre based on current values.  In the Bill we are increasing its jurisdiction to &euro;15,000 across the board generally.  It is only &euro;6,000 now.  Had we simply dealt with cost of living issues, it would be in the region of &euro;10,500.  That indicates the extent to which the value of monetary disputes has diminished in the District Court during the years.  The same applies to the Circuit Court.  It has had a jurisdiction generally in the region of just over &euro;38,000 since 1991.  Based on inflation, even to keep step with 1991 values, it should be in the region of approximately &euro;65,000.  We are increasing it to &euro;75,000 to take cognisance of the fact that this is important to the stability of the jurisdiction for a number of years and to take account of what are the appropriate capacities in both courts.  The effect of this will be that a substantial amount of work currently undertaken by the Circuit Court will now be done at District Court level.  It will save substantial legal costs for those who have to resort to court proceedings.  Some of the litigation that currently takes place in the High Court will, when the Bill becomes operative, be undertaken at Circuit Court level.  For those who need to use the court system in civil matters, there will be substantial savings in legal costs.  The other impact will be to free the High Court from some work in which it currently engages where there are disputes over sums of money below &euro;75,000 which will in the future be addressed in the Circuit Court.  The add-on impact will be fewer appeals to the Supreme Court.  It will take some time for this to impact on the system because the cases initiated before these changes take effect will have to continue within the court system in which they have been taken.<\/p><p>It is my objective - this is why I am very anxious we complete the legislative process before the summer vacation - that the relevant provisions in the Bill will come into force very early in order that when the courts are open in October after the summer vacation, they will operate under the new financial jurisdictional limits.  That is very important.  The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is being increased to only &euro;60,000 in the case of personal injury actions.  We will have a new approach in the context of jurisdiction, which is in the public interest.  It will mean that we will better utilise the court structure.  The exciting development for the court structure is that before we get too far into the autumn, we will have the referendum to establish a general court of appeal, which I hope will have the universal support of all sides of the House and will be supported by the public.  This will be another brick in the wall of the reforming agenda that we are seeking to implement in the public interest, which is important.<\/p><p>I thank Members of the House for their assistance and co-operation and dealing in a very considered way with the additional matters we have now included in this legislation.  I am sorry that I will be imposing on them again on matters that will arise in the D&aacute;il that we could not have ready in time for the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200032#JJ00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372784700,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Several colleagues have said they would like to make a brief comment.

The object that we had in mind was that if Mr. X made a complaint, where is he now?  The Minister was concerned that complainants should have anonymity and we have rephrased that to put the emphasis on the reforms.<\/p><p>  I mentioned on the previous occasion - it is mentioned in the briefing notes that the library service helpfully prepared for us - that the misgivings of Ms Estelle Feldman, who has studied this in Trinity College, Dublin, about breaches and whistleblowing are that the organisation never gets reformed and the whistleblower is punished.  I am also concerned that in some banks this has been going on for decades.  I refer to the ICI affair in the 1980s, the offshore deposits that were not offshore at all, secret pension funds for executives in the Caribbean, and then the gold medal one on 29 September.<\/p><p>  We must be able to measure progress as we try to eliminate these malpractices from Irish banking.  There have been a serious number of insurance collapses also.  How does the Central Bank know if we are making any progress in these matters?  Is it worthwhile reporting any breaches at all?  Nothing happens, they continue on as before, they get bailed out and the taxpayer gets stung again.<\/p><p>  We have rephrased the amendment in light of the Minister for Finance's concerns which, of course, we accept, in that we were not protecting anonymity.  How do we know if this is having any effect at all?  From listening to radio programmes, the furious wish of the Irish people is that the banking system should reform itself.  Can we have a measure of progress?<\/p><p>  As with all of these amendments, if they are of use to the Minister, we offer them in that spirit.  If Deputy Brian Hayes finds that they are not, it will not cause any great annoyance.  The public wants a new regime for regulating banks and these are suggestions from me and my colleagues on these Independent benches that could be off assistance.  If they are worse than that and might obstruct the Minister in the reforms, obviously, we would not push them.<\/p> <p>They are offered in the context of the anger since the release of the Anglo Irish Bank tapes about the conduct of banking in Ireland and the need for a stricter regulatory regime.  Every day in the House, Senators on all sides express their conviction that we are not making progress and that Irish banking is unreformed.  Banks do not treat people who fall into arrears well and they try to induce people to get away from their tracker mortgages.  Paddy O'Gorman of RTE discussed in the last couple of days cheque cashing services coming within the general remit of financial services.  Where one seeks to cash a cheque for &euro;50, one receives &euro;38 in cash.  This happens where people cannot wait five days for the money.  Why does it take five days for a bank to perform cash transmission in the era of electronics?  No credit is available for businesses.  This is about dealing with breaches, reforming the sector and looking for evidence that it has reformed.  Deputy Hayes and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, must deal with these issues on a daily basis.  I am not so sure the corporate culture has changed.  It must be sent a message from the Houses of the Oireachtas that we are opting for stricter regulation.  In that spirit, I offer my proposal to the Minister of State.  If it helps his hand, that would be good.  If there is no positive impact on what he is trying to do, that is fine.  We tried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200034#LL00800","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372786200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I am happy to second the amendment.

When one adds the figures for those in arrears of 90 days or more, those in arrears of 30 to 90 days and those who have had their mortgages restructured, one sees that 20% of all mortgages in the State are in distress.  While Central Bank supervision and enforcement, which is the subject matter of the Bill, are very important, we have taken the legs from under citizens who are paying for the very banks that ruined the economy.

The Minister for Finance and I accept fully what has been said by Senator Barrett, whose only objective is to improve the Bill.  He seeks not to stand in the way of its passage but to add to it.  The Bill, which I took on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, has been hanging around, as it were, for the past 18 months.  It came in as one Bill, but was substantially amendmended on foot of two very significant Private Members' Bills introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on finance, Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p> <p>These were inculcated into the Bill and it showed a readiness on the part of the Minister for Finance to respond to good ideas on the part of Opposition Deputies and Senators.  He has continued in that vein with this Bill.<\/p><p> I take the point that the Senator raises and I will explain the reasons we think the amendment is superfluous.  It is important to put this on record because these matters are often referred to in court.  Having the opportunity to explain them gives an insight into the minds of the Oireachtas Members in terms of the passage of any amendment to the legislation.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to include a new provision into Part V of the Bill, which requires the Central Bank to include in its annual report a statement of the reforms undertaken by financial services providers on foot of whistleblower disclosures.  I remind Senators that the Minister introduced an amendment in the D&aacute;il in response to concerns raised by Opposition parties on a similar point.  This is effectively section 38 of the Bill, the new section introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage on page 28.  The amendment inserts a new section into the Bill requiring the Governor to report to the Central Bank Commission on whistleblower disclosures and the action taken by the Central Bank on foot of them.  In this way, there will be appropriate oversight of the Central Bank's responsiveness to whistleblower disclosures.  Section 38(4) reads: <blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) The Governor shall provide a report to the Central Bank Commission at least annually on any action taken or not taken in response to protected disclosures.<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) The Central Bank Commission shall determine the form and content of the report to be provided under <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>.<\/blockquote>In our view, what Senators Quinn and Barrett are looking for is already contained in the legislation.  The report will be given, in the first instance, by the Governor to the Central Bank Commission and the commission will issue a report on an annual basis.<\/p><p> In the course of performing its function under the Central Bank Acts, the Central Bank receives information through a variety of means, including the provision of information by firms in response to statutory requests, information from authorised officer inspections and information obtained through regulatory returns.  The Central Bank also receives information through voluntary disclosures by financial services providers through routine reporting and other engagement on compliance issues.  It is a matter for the Central Bank to decide what action, if any, is required on foot of it receiving particular information, whether through whistleblowers or other means.  Based on its assessment and on subsequent investigations, the Central Bank may require action by the financial service provider.  The action may include compliance with regulatory direction, the provision of customer redress, administrative sanctions or the prosecution of an offence.  The Central Bank cannot require action on foot of the whistleblower disclosure alone.  It must first satisfy itself there are sufficient grounds that warrant action.  The action may only be required following due process and fair procedure.  In such cases, financial services legislation already provides for the publication of details of the action to be taken, the nature of the sanction or direction, albeit subject to some ground rules including, for example, ensuring the publication of the administrative sanction does not inhibit the prosecution of an offence.  On that basis, I am satisfied there are appropriate measures in place to ensure oversight of Central Bank action and transparency on the action required to be undertaken by financial service providers following due process and fair procedure.  This addresses much of the substance of the points raised by Senator Barrett.  The Minister for Finance is more than happy that the Senator is raising this issue again this evening.<\/p><p> I agree that what is required is a strong regulatory regime, which is clear and transparent for all to see.  Senator Barrett referred to Estelle Feldman, who is a friend of mine and who has written extensively on the topic of whistleblowers.  She is also a distinguished academic in Senator Barrett's university.  She has done much of the pioneering work in this area and has helped Opposition Deputies in producing legislation.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, would make the following point if he was here.  It is firm intent of the Government to produce, for the first time ever, legislation to protect whistleblowers across Irish public administration.  It is a key part of what we want to do in the political reform area and much of what Ms Feldman has written about over the course of the past decade and a half in her extensive research has greatly helped the Government and informed it of the legislative approach it should take.  We need to protect people who have information and use it in such a way as to act in the public interest.  We also need discretion for public agencies to investigate these matters and to come to a view on the substance of the allegations being made.  With regard to amendment No. 1, it is already provided for under section 38.  The Minister responded to an Opposition Deputy on Committee Stage in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200035#MM01600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372786800,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  We are <i>ad idem<\/i> on this.  In response to these appalling bank crises and flops in the country, let us consider what was the reaction to the first crisis.  It was that banks shall not buy insurance companies, or certainly not the one that bought an insurance company in London.  We took action against the illegal offshore accounts and the pensions in the Caribbean for bank executives.  All of this happened in one bank.  There was an array of policy responses to the people who bankrupted the country.  For Ireland's credibility internationally, we protected the whistleblower.  However, what about the rest of us?  Are we protecting society from this kind of conduct, which we all agree has been appalling?<\/p><p>  I might have tackled the problem in a different way but I share the goal of the Minister of State.  My concern is that it is not locked away in subsection 56.  When the Minister of State goes to European meetings, he can say that it is in our report that we took certain measures.  It is in section 38 and presumably it can be announced in reply to parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  We might have been ripped off on the first occasion but we took measures to ensure it does not happen again.  Everyone who lends money to the country will want to know what we did in response to the people who wasted it previously.  It is important the Seanad has received from the Minister of State a strong undertaking that we cannot keep doing this and that we will take measures to prevent a recurrence.  That is what the Minister of State said and it is what I am seeking.  I will not press the amendment but I thank the Cathaoirleach for his forbearance.  This is important because otherwise banks will shrug their shoulders and continue on as before.  Many people in the House and in the country are wondering when the banks will reform.  They seem to be wonderfully oblivious to the harm they have done and that is what has annoyed people about the tapes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200036#NN00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372786800,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372786800,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 44, line 5, after &#8220;with&#8221; to insert the following:<br \/>&#8220;The Competition Authority, the National Competitiveness Council and&#8221;.<\/blockquote>These amendments are allied.  We were talking to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, last Thursday and saying that we must distinguish, according to the American model, between Wall Street and Main Street.  Regulation of banks in the interests of banks is what we have had up to now.<\/p> <p>Attempts to correct the problem through quantitative easing promote asset bubbles which are again in the interests of banks and stockbrokers and not in the interest of the wider economy.  The shortage of capital as we try to develop a new entrepreneurial economy will not help.  The Minister's view last Thursday in the House was that he hoped that the competitive aspect of Irish banking would be improved by banks coming in from abroad.  He was hopeful that we would attract an industrial bank, which would provide competition.  While it had to be done at the time, the pillar bank concept is flawed in that it lead to a duopoly.  It may be such a duopoly that no foreign banks will want to set up here and that deterrent would not be in the interests of the wider economy.  Bearing in mind that the Minister says the State could try to develop a more competitive banking system and discussions may be taking place, we have a problem with the banking sector.<\/p><p>The June 2013 edition of the Compecon publication dealing with regulatory easing and competition states it is important to analyse competition agency decisions.  At EU level and in most member states, competition agencies are responsible for investigating and deciding on alleged infringements of competition law.  Ireland is somewhat unique in an EU context in this regard.  The Competition Authority's role is limited to carrying out investigations while it is for the courts to decide if parties have broken the law.  Central Bank regulation of banking failed spectacularly in 2008.  The Government is trying to get the regulation of banks out of a silo.  They have a blinkered look.  What is this doing to the economy, asset prices and people's living standards?  Why can housing or industry not be funded in a different way?<\/p><p>We experienced a classic case of regulatory capture prior to 2008.  The agency which was supposed to regulate banks in the wider public interest was captured to the extent of staff playing golf and winning prizes with the people they were supposed to regulate.  It was a disgraceful performance.  The Minister of State will note the deficiencies in our policy highlighted by Pat Massey in the Compecon paper.  Banking is too important to be left to bankers.  The new Governor, who is a former colleague of mine in the economics department of TCD, will seek to steer a different course given that his predecessors were captured.<\/p><p>This is not unique.  I asked on Second Stage who is supposed to regulate accountants.  They prepared accounts for the banks and the bankers were not regulated.  The State has tame regulators for electricity where the chief executive officer earns multiples of the Taoiseach's salary and the same can be said of the airport and transport sectors.  I am worried about sectoral regulation by regulators who have a tradition of being tamed and utterly dominated by the sector and who operate regardless of the consequences for the rest of society.  It is necessary to have somebody say a sector is not competitive and it could be made more competitive if the Competition Authority was brought in.  The competition regulator in Ireland is much weaker than in other countries, as Pat Massey says, which damages our competitiveness.  Having an input ensures we do not drift back to a regulatory regime where banking is unduly influenced by bankers attaining control over the Central Bank as they did so ignominiously in the past.<\/p><p>The amendment is an attempt to make the control of banking more of a team game in the interest of the public.  Perhaps if the Central Bank, Competition Authority and Competitiveness Council look at the competitiveness aspects, they will diverge but we badly need new insights into what banking has done to the rest of the economy.  Currently, the emphasis is entirely on restoring the financial health of the bank.  We know in this House, as does the Minister of State, that we are trying to restore the economy and the two are not the same.  The two certainly were not the same on 29 September 2008.  That is why I have tried to broaden the way we look at banking.  It is interesting that the Irish-Canadian, Mark Carney, has taken over as governor of the Bank of England.  He is trying to broaden bank regulation.  He comes from a highly successful background in Canada where none of these banking problems occurred and economic growth continues.  We need more inputs to get away from a silo.  If we had more inputs, the problem we are trying to correct now would not have happened.  I am not interested in prosperous banks; I would much prefer a prosperous economy.  I would like the other impacts to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200036#NN00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372787400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  It was interesting to read British financial newspapers over the past week and see references to Mark Carney and Canada being saved because of his regulation.  We got used to light touch regulation over the past 20 years and it seemed to do a world of good for some aspects of the economy until everything went wrong.  I did not realise that Ireland had such a weak regulatory system.  We thought we had a good system, not only in the banking sectors but in other sectors.  It appears we were incorrect and the light touch regulation got us into trouble.  Senator Barrett's amendment is worthy of consideration.  It takes a long time to get anything done in Ireland and not only in the context of regulation.  The US, UK and Japan moved much more quickly than we did to deal with criminal offences in the banking sector.  We take a long time.  That may protect some citizens but that also damages other citizens who think it unlikely anyone will suffer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200037#OO00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1372787400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank both Senators for raising this issue.  The prosperity of the economy is inextricably connected to the prosperity of our banks because we own most of them and the greater part of one of them.  The only way we will get our money back in some shape or form is to bring them back to some trajectory of profitability over the years.  Given the enormous amount of taxpayers' money put into these entities, the only way to get it back is to bring them back to a financially viable position.  We need a change of culture in banking where bankers know their business no different from Senator Quinn when he was in the retail business or Senator Barrett when he taught young people in TCD.  One has to knows one's business.  The great dilemma in the banking system was bankers were disconnected from their business.  They did not know the people who had deposits in their banks and regarded them with arrogance.  They did not make prudential investments in businesses or entrepreneurs and put all their money into bricks and mortar.<\/p><p>  We need to imbue a fundamental change of culture and I hope this legislation, which has been hanging around for a long time, meets the challenge of better regulation and exposes us to international experience.  Senator Barrett's point in this regard is well made.  We need to expose our entire regulatory establishment to the international rigour other countries employ.  It is more important in Ireland than other countries because we are small and highly deleveraged.  We have a huge private sector economy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> our public sector economy.  The financial services sector comprises 16% of the economy, which is large, although it is 30% in Luxembourg.  In a large financial services sector, which the State wants to expand, a regulatory environment is needed within the Central Bank culture which meets that need and which people say meets the international standard people will stand over.  I very much agree with that.<\/p> <p>I very much agree with that.<\/p><p>On the substance of the amendment, section 49 already provides for the Central Bank to consult with any entity it considers appropriate, so the consultation envisaged by Senator Barrett is already permitted under the Bill.  Section 49(1)(c) provides that the Central Bank may consult with such other persons as the bank considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.  There is no difficulty with the Central Bank consulting with the Competition Authority and the National Competitiveness Council, as it sees fit.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out earlier today in the Lower House, ultimately the Central Bank is independent of the political system.  It must be, by definition.  Unless it is we will not have a regulatory environment or culture that is free of the political shenanigans that can sometimes take place.  Section 49 empowers the Central Bank to consult with whatever it chooses in its work.<\/p><p>I read the transcript of the Senator's discussion with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on Committee Stage.  It was an interesting discussion in which the Senator discussed the issue of competitiveness.  We need a competitive model in this country.  The Senator suggested that the pillar bank model will not fit the bill and will fail.  It is a little like the French Revolution in that it is probably too early to tell.  However, the Senator is at one with the Minister for Finance when he speaks about competition.  In a series of later amendments we try to address that in respect of foreign banks from outside the European Union.  We would allow those banks to open branches following approval of the Central Bank, to encourage the type of competition the Senator wishes to see.  There is nothing to stop such banks coming to this country at present.  The success and stability of the Irish economy is predicated on more international banks coming to invest in Ireland and seeing Ireland as an opportunity.  They will not come unless they see a future for the country.  The Irish economy and the banks are inextricably linked.<\/p><p>In amendments Nos. 5 and 6 we will deal with the lack of competition issue, which the Senator discussed with the Minister for Finance.  It is on foot of that discussion that the Minister has tabled amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to try to deal with that issue and to have a more flexible approach for encouraging non-EU banks to come to this country to establish branches.  That will provide the competition and international experience suggested by the Senator.<\/p><p>The Irish banking system has gone through a torrent of change and it is only fair for Senators to ask if that has led to a cultural change.  That is the kernel of the issue here.  We have set out our stall in terms of the pillar banks.  The banks have become smaller entities and following the Mercer report the Government is now seeking reductions of between 6% and 10% in pay and remuneration across the banks.  All of the boards have effectively been taken out.  There is now more international experience within those banks.  If one examines the stress testing that followed the establishment of the pillar banks in March and April 2011, there was a very strong tiered capital ratio of 10.5%.  The likelihood is that when the new EU stress testing of banks emerges in the first quarter of next year the capital ratios will be approximately 9.5%.  There has been much change within the banks, and they need to get on with that change and make sure they have the people in their retail and commercial settings to deliver the model that is required.  Fundamental to that there must be a regulatory environment that works for everybody.<\/p><p>The collapse we experienced was not just a banking collapse but essentially a collapse of the entire regulatory system.  There is no doubt about that.  It is a matter of huge concern to the Irish people.  I agree with the Senator's remarks earlier about the tapes.  People want to get to the bottom of this.  They want answers and, ultimately, they wish to see prosecutions in the courts.  All of these matters will be resolved, hopefully to the satisfaction of the public and these Houses, through the inquiry system the Government intends to put in place.  All of those banks, regardless of whether their tapes have been published so far, would have to make themselves available with that information to an inquiry, were it to be established.  That point has been made very forcefully by the Minister for Finance today.<\/p><p>While I welcome the Senator's amendment, there is no need for it.  Under section 49 the Central Bank can consult with any entity it chooses in respect of the competition issue.  We are hoping to deal with the substance of the Senator's point about competition in amendments Nos. 5 and 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200037#OO00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372788000,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Section 49 provides that it may consult with such other persons as the bank considers appropriate.  That is what happened.  We now have a Central Bank Governor who I hope, and particularly if he is listening to this debate, will consider what something is doing for competition and competitiveness in the Irish economy.  However, if the bank does not consider that appropriate, it will not happen.  Obviously, in the past it did not consider it appropriate because that is how we got into trouble.  My preference would be to push the Central Bank to take a wider interest and, as the Minister of State said, to take a look at what the new governor of the Bank of England is doing.  We have referred to bad banks but we probably had a bad Central Bank as well which did not do its job up to 2007.  If they gain control of the Central Bank again, they might say they will just consult with the people they like because the choice is entirely theirs under section 49, which provides that the bank consult such persons as it considers appropriate to consult in the circumstances.  We are trying to provide that it should include the interests of competition and competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Our ability to draft these amendments was limited.  When the debate was adjourned last Thursday it was adjourned to Tuesday.  Tuesday means <i>ma&ntilde;ana<\/i> in the Seanad, as the Minister of State will know from his time here, so we did not expect it to happen on Tuesday.  There was hardly any time to frame amendments because they had to be tabled by 11 a.m. on Friday and we finished late on Thursday.  I had hoped the Minister was moving towards running banking in the interests of the wider economy and not just as the bank considers appropriate, given that this institution really let the country down.  One version of what happened is that the Central Bank was the bigger failure and the banks just did whatever they got away with.  That was massively damaging to the country.  At this stage, I would not be interested in what the Central Bank considers the appropriate way to regulate banks because whatever the model was it did not work and we are now paying the bill.<\/p><p>  Why will it not consult widely before it makes regulations, as we are asking it to do in this amendment?  Is it that in Ireland we always think in silos and people do not venture outside their own narrow patch, so nobody is looking after the wider national interest?  Who in the Central Bank or in the Department of Finance does not want to consult the two bodies mentioned?  It is really silly that they will not.  Why is the Central Bank seeking such power whereby it will decide whom it will consult?  That is the way it is phrased at present in that it can consult such other persons as the bank considers appropriate.  The Central Bank failed and we, as legislators, are telling it to do things better in future even if, informally, it could assure the House that it will never again be dominated by the sector it is supposed to be regulating in the national interest.  That is the silo mentality we have, with people not thinking outside the box or looking at other areas of the economy and the damage they do to those areas.<\/p><p>  I regret that the amendment is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>It would improve the Bill if it was.  The Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banks have to up their game on what they did to this country.  I do not understand why the Minister of State was advised not to accept even a mild amendment like this, particularly as we thought the Minister was heading in our direction before the debate had to end rather suddenly and it turned out to be a real rather than ma&ntilde;ana Tuesday.  We hoped he would think about it more. <\/p><p> I do not know how this will be read outside Ireland.  The Government is not willing to accept a statutory consultative role for the wider economy in the way we run banks so soon after the banks developed a rather strange and unacceptable vocabulary, as the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the President have said.  It is a strange and unacceptable way of running banks.  It indicates a certain dismissive nature towards Parliament when the Minister of State is advised to respond in this way.  It would not have done any harm.  A few egos may have been bruised a little but that is mild compared to what has happened to the rest of the country.  The Minister of State has had to deal with that in terms of special needs assistants and reductions in pay and child benefit.<\/p><p> It is strange that we cannot have a mentality that it is a good idea to have people on board discussing what this will do for competitiveness and competition.  As we have said <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, Ireland has high cost and sheltered sectors, which restricts our ability to develop competitive international sectors.  Banking is one of those sectors; no other sector has imposed such a burden on the rest of us.  It is regrettable that there is a mentality of not reforming what should be reformed and continuing to defend what we used to do in the past, given all the evidence of the damage that has been done to the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200038#PP00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372788600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>It is not fair to say we are in disagreement on this.

I do not wish to detain the Minister of State.<\/p><p>  The amendment proposes that the ombudsman report include information about complaints.  We seek to add what is stated in the amendment.  The rest is covered, such as the name of the regulated financial provider, including any trading name, the identity of any group of which the regulated financial services provider is a member and the number of complaints signed to be substantiated or partially substantiated in respect of the regulated financial services provider in the preceding financial year.  <\/p><p>  There was a complaint yesterday about a situation in which a bank decided not to charge a person &euro;12 to cash a &euro;50 cheque.  These organisations have a tradition of cocking a snook at the Government, the Central Bank and the rest of us, and are still talking to us through their tapes on a daily basis.  We need to know what happened and whether the abuses were addressed and corrected.  This is against the background of the work of Estelle Feldman, whom the Minister of State mentioned.  She fears that organisations do not reform and whistleblowers are penalised.<\/p><p>  There was a report on 22 April 2012 by Daniel McConnell and Tom Lyons on the whistleblowers' dire warnings which were silenced by senior finance chiefs.  It quotes Robert Pye and Marie Mackle.  Ms Mackle said, &quot;I've paid the price for being an internal whistleblower.  As matters stand currently, I am completely ostracised and my work is ignored.&quot;  If people are going to go out on a limb we have to know whether anybody listened when they drew to our attention what happened and whether the reforms that took place can be included in a report.  This is a good place in the Bill to introduce that.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State said, we are trying to change a corporate culture.  I appreciate what he said but many in the House would see it has not changed.  Banking in Ireland used to be a utility service.  People lodged savings which were looked after and ready for them when they grew old.  It inculcated a habit of thrift among young people.  That was replaced by the managerial casino generation which wrecked banks.  I am not sure whether the latter group has been fully expunged from the banking system, because it is not the picture painted in the House on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  This section gives the Government a mechanism to ask what happened in regard to complaints.<\/p> <p>The Financial Services Ombudsman will then be able to include that information in his or her annual report.  The banks might not like this proposal, but the rest of us who are paying dearly for their actions will not tolerate a situation where they are not held fully accountable.  Ensuring full accountability is the object of this proposal.  Representatives of the banks have been before the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, but we are still not getting the whole story.  We must use every piece of armoury at our disposal to make institutions accountable, which includes a requirement to report on how they responded to complaints made against them and the reforms they introduced when whistleblowers exposed the many abuses in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200039#QQ01000","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372789200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Senator Sean D.

That is the problem.  As well as the categorisation of complaints, we must have categorisation of responses.  To say the sector would find anything this Parliament does \"unduly burdensome\" suggests the people who are supposed to be regulating the banks have some neck.  The sector has cost this country something short of &euro;64 billion and may end up costing us &euro;90 billion, yet a small amendment from the Seanad is deemed unduly burdensome.  Is the Minister of State trying to win a prize for irony?  It is an amazing statement which I find unduly burdensome to entertain.<\/p><p>We must consider the realities of the situation.  People are protesting at the gates of Leinster House, yet the banks consider it unduly burdensome to set out their responses to complaints made against them.  Is the Central Bank still captured by the commercial banks?  Is there any hope at all that we can ever put manners on the sector?  One can only wonder at the notion that a small request from Parliament is considered unduly burdensome.<\/p> <p>I am saddened by this, because I came here to help the Government to make reforms.  This sector needs reform, but I am told that a reform as minuscule as this is unduly burdensome.  It is about time some of these people did an honest day's work.  They do not see it as unduly burdensome to us when they walk out with &euro;64 billion, heading for &euro;90 billion, nor do they see as unduly burdensome the manner in which they treat their customers.  Yet they are able to persuade the Government that to implement this section would be unduly burdensome.  The spirit of what we tried to achieve last Thursday, in co-operation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is eroded by a response such as this.  No sector has been more burdensome on this economy than the sector we are trying to regulate here.<\/p><p>Rather than express the anger I feel, I will sit down.  However, I find it amazing that the briefing note suggests this proposal is unduly burdensome for a sector which has done so much damage to every person in the country, from the youngest to the oldest.  Some 300,000 people have left this country.  Unemployment has risen from 4% to 14% and there is massive youth unemployment, but the banks which caused this find this proposal unduly burdensome.  I am saddened by that, but I will not push the amendment.

No. 201 of 1992).&quot;.&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372789800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he would introduce this amendment to the Central Bank Act 1971 to provide an authorisation regime for branches of third country banks.  These branches would be subject to the same standard of regulation as those branches currently passporting into Ireland from within the European Union.  The Central Bank Act 1971 provides the statutory basis for the authorisation regime for credit institutions in Ireland.  The 1971 Act and the related European directive - the capital requirements directive - also provide the basis for the passporting regime within the European Union.  Passporting is a system which allows financial services operators legally established in one member state to establish and provide their services in the other member state without further authorisation requirements.<\/p><p>These amendments insert three new sections into the Central Bank Act 1971 to provide an authorisation regime for credit institutions which are authorised outside the European Union to operate a branch in Ireland.  These third country banks would be able to apply to the Central Bank for an authorisation on the basis that the institution would remain under the responsibility of its home regulator in terms of prudential regulations, but would be subject to Central Bank rules on the conduct of business.  The new section, 9A, provides that the Central Bank can only grant an authorisation where the credit institution is subject to a regulatory system in its home territory, which is at least as robust as the Irish system.  Furthermore, the level of protection afforded to deposits by virtue of the bank's authorisation in its home country must be at least as robust as that which operates in Ireland under the deposit guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>The Central Bank is also required to notify the relevant European authorities of any authorisation under this section.  This arises from the requirement in the directive that third country branch authorisations should not offer more favourable terms to credit institutions passporting from outside of the European Union than would be available from within the European Union.  This will act as a further check on the system to ensure that this regime does not act in any way to dilute the standard of regulation that applies.<\/p><p>The new section 9B sets out the provisions that are to apply where the Central Bank refuses a grant of authorisation and is based on the system that already applies to domestic credit institutions.  In short, it affords an opportunity to the applicant to make representations where the Central Bank is minded to refuse the application and before the Central Bank has issued its final decision.<\/p><p>The new section 9C sets out the provisions that are to apply where the Central Bank revokes a third country branch authorisation and is also based on the system that already applies to domestic credit institutions.  The grounds for revocation include circumstances in which the holder becomes unable to meet its obligations to its creditors; no longer provides security for the assets entrusted to it; is convicted on indictment of an offence under the provision of the 1972 Act; is convicted of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust; is a company that is being wound up; or no longer holds an authorisation from the relevant third country authority.  In this case, the provisions afford the opportunity to the institution to make representations before the Central Bank has issued its final decision.<\/p> <p>The Central Bank must also consult the third country authority unless immediate action by the Central Bank is required, in which case only notification is required.  This section also sets out the responsibilities on the branch after its authorisation has been revoked and these mirror the provisions that apply to domestic credit institutions.  In brief, the institution's responsibilities towards deposits and with regard to other repayable funds do not change post-revocation until those responsibilities have been discharged to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.<\/p><p>I indicated earlier that we would be moving with these amendments.  The Minister flagged these amendments on Committee Stage.  It is hoped these will add some dimension of competition to the Irish domestic banking situation in order to encourage the third country banks to establish branches in Ireland.  They would be subject to the same oversight and regulatory environment as other institutions in this country.  If such banks could be encouraged to come to Ireland, albeit in a small way, this would be a means of ensuring a competitive banking system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200041#SS01100","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372790400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>We acknowledged on Committee Stage that the Minister had accepted quite a few Opposition amendments from the D&aacute;il.

I note the irony of the Minister of State's remarks on the day that Ulster Bank, which is an established bank, is closing 40 branches.  This shows the difficulty faced by anyone wishing to establish a bank here.  There is a further difficulty and it is a case of which comes first, the chicken or the egg.  The existing pillar banks are not lending to the companies who are starved of cash flow because they are not profitable enough.  They cannot become profitable enough because the cash flow is not being made available to them.  Until these companies become profitable these banks - which are primarily based in other jurisdictions - will not even look at this country.  They will not look at this country because businesses are not in sufficient profit.<\/p><p>I question whether this new section in the Bill will be of any real benefit in the near future.  The country is now going back to depending on AIB and Bank of Ireland.  When he was a Member of this House, Deputy Shane Ross called them the fuddy-duddy banks for not keeping apace with Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  I have a real concern that this section will not be relevant for perhaps decades.  It will not be of use to the entrepreneurs, the people who take risks, because they will not be given the short-term funding they badly require now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200042#TT00300","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1372790400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I welcome the insertions and I commend Senator Gilroy on raising this point on Committee Stage.  I am on the record as opposing the pillar banks approach because I thought we missed an opportunity by subsuming EBS into AIB as outside investors were interested in doing that.  Competition will be the issue.  The Minister's amendment attempts to entice competition into the market.  The only other bank which is expanding in Ireland is KBC, a Belgian bank.  It is opening new branches and is beginning, tentatively, to lend in the first-time buyer market.  It is not operating in the commercial and business sector and that is a problem.  The past few years have seen massive changes in the banking sector and this Bill will create further changes.  I agree these two amendments are important.  I think the EBS is now effectively dead.  It was the largest lender to first-time buyers even in the period 2009 to 2010.  It is finished now and it has no real lending capacity in any shape or form.  The credit unions have also been reined back - correctly so in some instances and not so in other instances.  Many businesses were obtaining loans from credit unions but their lending have been restricted.<\/p><p>I hope that in ten years time we will not rue the day when we did not sell EBS in late 2010, early 2011, when the deal was done.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for his own good reasons, decided to subsume it into AIB and to create, in his view, two strong banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  However, Senator D'Arcy is correct.  Ulster Bank is shutting down 41 branches and reducing its activity in the market.  I suggest that if it were not for its technical IT issue over the past year, the bank would have announced these closures earlier, perhaps one year ago.  That is what former colleagues of mine in the market tell me.  We will need to be very careful to see what decisions Ulster Bank will make.  I refer to the comments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Ulster Bank had to be propped up by the British Exchequer and that British banks should concentrate their business.  We need to watch very carefully with regard to Ulster Bank's future in the Republic.  <\/p><p>I agree that these are sensible amendments which are needed.  I wish to put on the record of the House my opposition at the time to the pillar banks approach.  I hope I am wrong and I hope we will see competition in the market because it is desperately needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200042#TT00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1372790400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I support the Minister's amendments.  It will be extremely difficult to introduce competition into the Irish market in this way because the two pillar banks are so protected.  We were doing the same for VHI for a long period and also for CIE and Aer Lingus.  If outside investors see one or two companies being supported utterly and totally by the taxpayer, they will find it very difficult to put a proposition to their boards that they should enter the Irish market.<\/p><p>As other Senators said, Ulster Bank seems now to have been as irresponsible as any of the indigenous banks and the British taxpayer had to bear the burden for it.  It is probable that Bank of Scotland Ireland was even more irresponsible than the others.  The first understanding is that the British taxpayers will pay if any of these banks goes broke.  We have been caught to pay for the Irish ones.  Even then there is a downside risk because the first bank in this country to go belly-up was DEPFA.  Much of the subsequent hostility of Germany towards Ireland was that DEPFA bank was not sufficiently regulated within the IFSC.  <\/p> <p>That cost the German taxpayer dearly.  New banks are needed.  As the other Bill before the House has in mind the separation of utility banking and casino banking, perhaps we might rebuild banking.  The irresponsibility that took over Irish banks - Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Irish Nationwide Building Society were appallingly unregulated businesses - has cost us dearly and left us in a most unsatisfactory position.  So far our experience with foreign banks has not been good.  <\/p><p> I wish the Minister of State well.  Unfortunately, it will be a long time before any Member of the House feels the benefit of the new banks.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the Industrial Credit Company had an expertise on which a completely property-based associated bank system was based and we have to try to recreate it, perhaps through the foreign banks the Minister of State mentioned.  I know the Minister for Finance is keen to get his money back, as all of us are, but I no longer see the banks as entrepreneurial activities.  They do not have the abilities, training or capabilities to do that work.  Inventing new kinds of bank, on which the Minister was very keen the last day and which the Minister of State has mentioned again, will be the way forward.  Bringing them in, as proposed in these two amendments, is an advance.  Like other Senators, I wish the Minister well in these endeavours, but I would like to be much more optimistic that this will work as it deserves to.  We need that expertise.  As an alternative to pouring good money after bad, it is well worth exploring.  <\/p><p> In the current edition of <i>The Phoenix<\/i>there is a downbeat assessment of where AIB stands as one of the pillar banks.  I know the Minister is reasonably optimistic, but unless the corporate culture changes and the banks improve - we in this House would like to see evidence of this - I do not believe they will play much of a role in promoting the economy in the future.  What the Bill has, therefore, is a very good set of amendments which I will support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200042#TT00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372791000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  It would be unfair to suggest the contributions, from all sides, have not been useful.  In the discussion we have had on the sections they have been useful, specifically on these two amendments.  Senator John Gilroy spoke about this.  Equally, it is fair to say the Bill has been in gestation for some time and has been amended and changed significantly to take on board the issues the Opposition has raised.  This is certainly not the Bill we started out with; it is, effectively, a completely new one and has been greatly strengthened as a result.<\/p><p>Much of our discussion has been about what happened in the past.  There comes a time, however, when we have to talk about what is happening now and the future and where we see the economy growing.  It is absolutely the case that there can only be a successful economy where there is a competitive banking model underpinning it.  I always refer to the point that when we first came into office, had I been told at the end of December of that year we would own only 15% of Bank of Ireland, I would have asked for the chaps in the white coats to take me away because that would not have been possible.  However, it did happen, which was an extraordinary boost of confidence in the new Government's ability to sell a substantial amount of Bank of Ireland to get it away into the private sector.  We have seen the benefits that can accrue.  I have no doubt that the reason sentiment in the country has changed is there is a view abroad that finally we have got our act together in banking, not only in terms of the new regulatory system to be established under the Bill but also in terms of the decisions we have taken on the pillar banks.   <\/p><p>I concede, however, that the devil is in the detail and, more importantly, the delivery.  We now have to deliver the things we said we would.  I refer to the mortgage issue mentioned by a number of Senators.  We have set very clear targets for what has to be achieved and must deliver on this and ensure it is done in terms of the Central Bank's dialogue with the individual banks concerned.  Equally, when it comes to lending into the real economy, a commitment was given by the pillar banks to lend over a three year period more than &euro;21 billion - as it were, a kind of Irish quantative easing.  The banks were, effectively, stuffed with cash in order that they would lend into the real economy.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg.  In circumstances where people cannot get credit and appeal to the Credit Review Office the decisions in 60% of cases are overturned, which proves the system is working.  Unless we are talking about a positive future and mindful of the mistakes we made in the past, we will not get the country to a better place and will certainly not get the banks to a better place.<\/p><p>There was a comment on the fact that Ulster Bank intended to close 41 branches.  That is an unfortunate indication of where modern retail banking is going.  It does not see its role to have large branch networks up and down the country.  The advances made in Internet and online banking have meant banks can do things differently and deleverage their own systems, reduce their cost base and, in consequence, focus on their core business.  The same applies to Ulster Bank, as it does to other banks, notwithstanding the difficulties this causes in communities, which I fully accept.  <\/p><p>What we are getting at in both amendments is summed up in an awful modern phrase which I will use because it probably explains what I am trying to say - bespoke banking.  I do not believe the banks that will come in, as Senator John Gilroy remarked, are going to be the large-scale, high street banks which will establish networks willy-nilly around the country.  However, specific banks will come in that have specific market interests.  For example, one of the things in which I am most interested is Islamic banking, which offers extraordinary opportunities.  The Islamic banking model has been hugely successful.  It deals with the issue of prudential risk, invests long term and does not go for the speculative property bubble, in the way many of our commercial banks did.  There is now an opportunity for an Islamic bank to come to Ireland.  There is also aviation finance - a big issue in Senator Darragh O'Brien's constituency - which is hugely important business for Ireland.  We are a world leader in this regard and there is no reason we cannot make an opportunity for third country banks through the use of aviation finance.  Third country banks could have the opportunity, by way of a bilateral arrangement, to come and use the existing network of banks and branches.  That is provided for.  Do I see this immediately as a new opportunity?  I do not, but by the provision of these sections there is now the opportunity, if banks want to invest in this country.  That has happened as a result of observations made in this House, on which I congratulate Senators.  Senators might be feeling unloved in the current environment with Madame la Guillotine hanging around the place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200043#UU00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372791000,"counter":639,"content":"<p>We are all right; do not worry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200043#UU00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1372791000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>However, on my own behalf and that of the Minister for Finance, I assure them the observations made in this House are always useful, constructive, positive and greatly help us to improve legislation that has already gone through the tumble dryer in the past 18 months or so.

An Post and the Prize Bond Company are agents of the National Treasury Management Agency in respect of the State savings product range.  Neither An Post nor the Prize Bond Company retains or manages any State savings money.  All State savings money is placed directly with the Government under the management of the NTMA and forms part of the national debt.  The direct unconditional obligation of the Government to repay the national debt applies equally to State savings, which include principal, interest and bonus payments if due, and, in respect of prize bonds, cash prizes.<\/p><p>The value of one prize bond is &euro;6.25 and the minimum purchase is four prize bonds costing &euro;25.  Each prize bond that has not been encashed is entered into a weekly draw for a range of cash prizes.  The top prize is currently &euro;1 million in the last weekly draw of every second month - that is, February, April, June, August, October and December - and &euro;20,000 in all other weekly draws.  Approximately 8,000 other cash prizes are awarded each week.<\/p><p>The European Council and European Parliament have adopted legislation to protect the financial system and certain professions and activities from being misused for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the third EU money laundering directive, the provisions of which were transposed into Irish Law by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  Part 4 of the Act sets out the obligations in regard to customer identification for the purposes of the legislation.  These include the obligation to conduct customer due diligence prior to the establishment of a business relationship.  Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and the beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.  The extent to which a particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements is determined by reference to the Act, having regard to the underlying directives.<\/p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a designated person under the Act as they fall within the definition of a financial institution.  In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of prize bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.  The Act designates the Central Bank as the competent authority for financial services providers, with responsibility for monitoring them and taking measures that are necessary for the purposes of securing their compliance with the Act.  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.  In light of the above, the Minister for Finance is exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, whether exemptions available under the directive may be applied to small-value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.  The two Ministers are investigating whether a more flexible arrangement can apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200044#VV00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372791600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Post office workers in County Clare will be delighted to learn that the Ministers are considering ways of allowing more flexibility.

In 2012 the Hungarian Government passed a law defining homelessness as an administrative offence, with the result that people who get caught sleeping on the street twice in six months can be punished with incarceration or monetary penalties that no homeless person could afford.  After the country's constitutional court annulled the law for violating the human dignity of the homeless, their legal certainty and their right to property, the constitution was changed in March to reinforce the political decision to criminalise homeless people.<\/p><p>I realise that Budapest's capacity has been stretched to its limits, but deep poverty needs to be cured rather than banned.  The United Nations has reported that an estimated 8,000 homeless people live in Budapest and between 30,000 and 35,000 are homeless in the country as a whole.  The unemployment rate in Hungary is 10.9%.  Homeless rights advocates have argued that shelters are overcrowded and are calling on the Hungarian Government to focus on providing affordable housing rather than temporary accommodation.  According to an independent research team called the Third of February Working Group, there were only 10,205 official beds for the homeless in 2012.  The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, human rights and the right to adequate housing has called on Hungary to revise its laws criminalising homelessness and stated that homeless persons should not be deprived of their basic rights to liberty, privacy, personal security and the protection of their family solely because they are poor and in need of shelter.<\/p><p>Hungary is obliged under the European Social Charter, the Council of Europe treaty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to vindicate the right to adequate housing.  The EU recognises the right to social housing and housing assistance in order to combat social exclusion and poverty, and in June 2010 it adopted the Europe 2020 strategy to promote social inclusion.<\/p><p>Homelessness is one of the most extreme forms of poverty and social deprivation.  This law is an unacceptable violation of human dignity.  The right to housing as set out in Article 31 of the revised European Social Charter should be guaranteed and Hungary should fulfil its obligations under Article 12.<\/p> <p>A policy of repression and criminalisation is no answer to social problems.  The Hungarian Government should revoke the law that makes it a crime to be homeless.  It raises serious human rights concerns and is very difficult to reconcile with Hungary's human rights obligations.  It defies logic to punish the poorest people in society just because they live on the streets.  Fines and imprisonment will do nothing to address the fundamental problems which lead to homelessness.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to set out the position Ireland is taking in respect of these laws, the deliberations he has undertaken with his Hungarian counterpart and whether the issue was raised during the Presidency, particularly in the context of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200044#VV00700","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372792200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  Unfortunately, the T&aacute;naiste is not in a position to attend the House and has asked me to take the matter.<\/p><p>The foreign Minister in Hungary, J&aacute;nos Martonyi , wrote to all EU foreign Ministers last March to inform them of changes to the Hungarian constitution which were subsequently approved by the Hungarian Parliament.  The changes have given rise to a number of concerns within the EU, the wider international community and civil society on the independence of the judiciary, particularly the constitutional court of Hungary.  There are also concerns about the possible curtailment of civil liberties.  In a joint statement dated 11 March 2013, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe expressed regret that their experts had not been afforded the opportunity to discuss the amendments with Hungarian officials before final approval.  They also raised concerns about whether the amendments to the Hungarian constitution respected the principle of the rule of law, EU law and Council of Europe standards.  The T&aacute;naiste expressed in the D&aacute;il Ireland's full support for the joint statement and encouraged the Hungarian Government to engage fully to ensure it meets its EU and international obligations.<\/p><p>The European Commission is conducting a detailed assessment of the amendment.  In April, President Barroso wrote to Hungary's Prime Minister to indicate that, on a first analysis, the Commission had serious concerns about the compatibility of the constitutional changes with EU legislation and the principle of the rule of law.  Also in April, during a debate on the constitutional situation in Hungary in the European Parliament, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, acting in her Presidency role, recalled the EU's basic values, which are set out in the treaty and also contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all EU member states are party.  She indicated that the promotion of the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights are important priorities and noted that equality, tolerance, respect for human rights and the rule of law are the values on which the European Union is founded.  Members of the European Parliament's LIBE committee are engaged in dialogue with Hungary and there is another important debate today in the EU Parliament in which the Hungarian Prime Minister is scheduled to participate.<\/p><p>The Council of Europe remains actively engaged on the matter, primarily through its Secretary General and advisory body on constitutional matters, the Venice Commission.  At the joint request of the Secretary General and Hungarian authorities, the Venice Commission recently adopted a detailed opinion on the implications of the fourth amendment to the Hungarian fundamental law in which it set out several concerns, including concerns on the homelessness issue as raised by Senator Reilly.  While indicating that there remains some difference of views in certain areas, Hungary has indicated that it will carefully examine the opinion and remains open for dialogue and co-operation.  We support fully the efforts being made by the EU, the Venice Commission and the European Parliament, among others, to engage with the Hungarian authorities on this matter.  We welcome the engagement that has been undertaken by the Hungarian authorities in recent months.  This has led to some proposed changes to be voted on by the Hungarian Parliament in autumn.<\/p><p>While all concerns have yet to be fully allayed, including on the homelessness issue, the process of consultation is continuing.  The Hungarian authorities have indicated that they are fully committed to dialogue with the relevant European and international institutions on these concerns.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and trust that the dialogue under way will lead to further changes which will address these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200045#WW00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Recruitment","time":1372792200,"counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200045#WW00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1372792200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to the House and thank him for taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I have asked for this matter to be taken on the Adjournment to ask the Minister about the ongoing issue of retired teachers being re-employed in schools, often as substitute teachers or on a part-time basis.  I have also asked him to address the issue of retired teachers being employed by the State Examinations Commission to act as examiners in practical subjects and to supervise the State exams.<\/p><p>Figures released in 2012 revealed that 1,311 retired teachers were employed as supervisors in the State exams while only 726 non-permanent teachers were hired.  Since coming into Government, I understand that the Minister has committed with the Government to ensuring that unemployed and newly qualified teachers should be employed in schools where possible.  I am extremely disappointed that the figures released this year, however, reveal again that more than 1,000 retired teachers were employed to supervise the State examinations.  Of the 4,861 superintendents hired this year, almost 25%, or 1,049, were retired teachers, while just 250 unemployed teachers were hired.  These figures are worrying given that last year 3,365 people graduated as teachers.  I have inquired about these statistics before and been assured that newly qualified and unemployed teachers were prioritised this year.  However, I meet constantly with newly qualified teachers who have been unsuccessful in securing positions as superintendents.  I requested information as late as May 2013 on the number of retired teachers being employed as superintendents and am disappointed that I have yet to receive a formal reply.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would communicate my concerns to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to ensure that I get a response.  Meanwhile, I have read about the figures in the media and am disappointed not to have been supplied with them directly.<\/p><p>The TextaSub service which links schools to substitute teachers and can aid unemployed teachers in finding substitute positions is welcome, but it does not solve the problem.  For example, in my home county of Louth, just nine teachers are registered for the service.  As a former teacher and someone who is in communication with teachers in my home town, I am aware of the fact that there are many more than nine teachers in Louth who are seeking teaching positions.  Often, an unemployed teacher must move to a more urban area to seek any kind of employment.  They may not be living in the county and therefore cannot register for the service.  Every day, I am contacted by newly qualified and unemployed teachers who are desperate to find teaching employment.  They are graduates with excellent qualifications and skills, often past pupils who would make fantastic teachers and inject into their schools new ideas and teaching methods.  However, they are disillusioned to discover that even substitute cover is often offered to retired teachers.  I do not blame the Minister for this.  He has made progressive remarks and tried to counteract the trend.  The problem lies with certain schools which have a habit of employing retired teachers.<\/p><p>I had a worrying conversation with a former teacher recently.  He informed me quite proudly that he had been employed constantly to provide maternity cover and substitute teaching since his retirement.  I was informed recently of a teacher who was retiring this year.  The teacher in fact retired last year and was obviously taken back by the school on a part-time basis.  I find this extremely frustrating when we have newly qualified young graduates who do not want to leave the country.  They want to stay and give something back through their education and skills.<\/p> <p>Further examples of retired principals and deputy principals being employed to provide substitute cover or being employed as exam supervisors have been relayed to me by disillusioned graduates and the parents of graduates who have invested hard-earned money, energy and commitment to see children graduate as qualified teachers.  I ask the Minister of State to consider taking further measures to ensure newly qualified teachers and unemployed teachers are prioritised.  Schools have major autonomy in employing part-time and substitute teachers, as they do in the area of voluntary contributions and uniforms, which is another debate.  Perhaps the Minister of State can relay to the Minister the suggestion that we create a system whereby the Department decides who will provide substitute cover, illness cover and maternity cover in order to ensure a more fair and equitable system will be provided for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200045#WW00400","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372792800,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator we have one thing in common in that we are both former teachers.  I have an understanding of the point the Senator is making.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who is in Cabinet at the moment.  The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State examinations.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has no role in the selection criteria for the appointment of superintendents of State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission has provided the following information.  Some 5,000 superintendents were appointed by the commission to almost 750 second level schools for the 2013 examinations.  This does not include almost 9,000 superintendents appointed locally by schools, mindful of the specific needs of each individual student, to supervise students with special educational needs.<\/p><p>In the main, the State Examinations Commission appoints experienced teachers as examination superintendents.  It is considered that teachers' classroom management skills and experience of working with young people are equally required for the effective conduct of the examination superintending duties.  In 2013 a further criterion for appointment was introduced by the State Examinations Commission in order to comply with the terms of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, whereby all applicants had to be on the register of teachers maintained by the Teaching Council.<\/p><p>There is a long-standing policy of appointing unemployed and substitute teachers before drawing on other applicants.  The State Examinations Commission highlighted this category of applicant when running the 2013 advertisement and recruitment campaign.  The number of unemployed teachers appointed rose to 250 from 190 in 2012 and the number of substitute teachers appointed rose to 716 from 429 in 2012.  Retired teachers may apply and be appointed in accordance with the terms of the Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment on a number of grounds, including age.  Following the removal of any upper age limit in 2005 as a consequence of the employment equality legislation, the number of retired teachers engaged as superintendents increased from 406 in 2006 to 1,458 in 2012, dropping to 1,049 in 2013.<\/p><p>The board of management of a school, in accordance with the provisions of the Education Acts, manages a school on behalf of the patron.  The board of management of a school, or the education training board, ETB, in the case of the ETB schools, is responsible for recruitment, selection, appointment, discipline and dismissal of staff.  Teachers and other staff are employed by the board of management or ETB.  The Minister is not a party to that contract.<\/p><p>I agree that priority should be given to unemployed teachers over those in receipt of pensions and the Department has taken the following steps in this regard.  Information notes were issued to schools in October 2009 and October 2010, which requested that schools prioritise unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension when appointing temporary teachers.  Circular 31\/2011 was issued to schools in May 2011 to ensure, as far as practicable, that people appointed to teach are registered teachers with qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are employed and that unemployed teachers are offered employment in preference to those who have retired.  It required each school to keep a list of appropriately qualified registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice.  This list must not include the names of registered teachers in receipt of pension in respect of service given under a public service pension scheme.  It also obliged the principal to keep a record and report to the board of management any instances when retired registered teachers and unregistered persons are employed.  The Department has also engaged with a number of schools who show up on the Department's payroll as employing retired teachers.<\/p><p>During the period of the written examinations each June, much of the integrity of the examination process depends on the manner in which superintendents perform their assigned tasks.  It is a critical role and one that has been performed with excellence, skill and dedication by thousands of superintendents over the years.  Superintendents have a range of important duties over a three week period in June.  These include the safe custody of the examination papers, the safe custody of completed examination scripts and the safe and proper conduct of each day's examinations in line with the rules and procedures laid down by the State Examinations Commission.<\/p><p>The question of appointments of superintendents of State examinations is obviously an operational one.  The State Examinations Commission is the body charged with the running of the State examinations and the focus of the greatest expertise in that regard.  It makes perfect sense that this operational matter should be fully within the remit of the State Examinations Commission.<\/p><p>The Minister will refer the detailed issues raised in this debate to the commission for its information and consideration.  Since September 2010, the recruitment of teachers by schools strongly favours unemployed teachers over those in receipt of pension.  Under Circular 0040\/2011 and subsequently circular 0008\/2013, teachers who are retired and who return to teaching were remunerated at the first point of the revised salary scales applicable to new entrants at the date of re-entry.  This represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.  The forthcoming commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2011 on 1 November 2013 will provide a requirement for those in Oireachtas funded teaching posts to be registered with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from Oireachtas funds.  These measures are positive for unemployed teachers.  The comments of Senator Moran will be brought to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070200046#XX00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1372792800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has pointed out some of the measures taken by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, but I am worried the problem still exists and that the measures have not counteracted the problem.

I wish to discuss the need for urgent accommodation for the Priorswood outreach service, Sphere 17.  This service provides a wide range of services for young people from Darndale, Bonnybrook and Priorswood areas of Dublin 17, which is one of the most socially disadvantaged parts of the whole country.  Last year, the service worked with over 1,250 people between the ages of ten and 21.  It is a huge service and, through its programmes, Sphere 17 provides positive and enjoyable ways for young people to spend their time, provides a drop in service where teenagers can play pool and hang out with their friends in an alcohol-free environment throughout the year, and provides young people with opportunities to engage in arts programmes and other initiatives they would otherwise not have.<\/p> <p>They do hugely important health promotion work, running alcohol and drug awareness and teen pregnancy programmes.  They also undertake mental health initiatives, which are important, particularly for at risk young people, and a wide range of other important initiatives.  Through all this, they help to improve young people's self-esteem and confidence in themselves and encourage them to avail of opportunities in school and elsewhere, to believe in themselves and to build a better future.  The team covers three areas - Darndale, Priorswood and Bonnybrook.<\/p><p>The team in Priorswood provides an incredible service but the staff are working in incredibly bad physical conditions.  They work out of a portakabin, which was only ever intended to be short-term accommodation.  It is in a dreadful state, having been run down over the years.  It is currently closed because it was broken into yet again.  It is a particularly vulnerable building.  It is easy to break into and it cannot be used at the moment.  The staff are managing to cope with the summer programmes because, apart from today's horrendous weather, they have been lucky with the weather.  They have been able to put on initiatives outdoors but that will not be a possibility heading into the winter.  They badly need a new purpose built, secure building to replace the portakabin to provide this valuable service.<\/p><p>They have raised &euro;55,000 with great effort and they are seeking &euro;100,000 under the youth cafe capital programme.  I wrote to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about this a number of months ago.

Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision-making, motivation, and self-responsibility can be acquired in a learning by doing manner.  The aim of the youth service is to assist all young people to become active participants in a democratic society.  In essence, the primary objective of the youth service is to help realise the potential of each young person and to facilitate their full participation in community life.<\/p><p>The youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  Funding of some &euro;53.498 million is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at-risk young people are provided through the youth service grant scheme, the special projects for youth, SPY, scheme, the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF,  rounds 1 and 2 and local drugs task force, LDFT projects, youth information centres as well as other initiatives such as the local youth club grant scheme.  The focus of this financial support in 2013, as in previous years, is on the consolidation of existing youth work provision and on the safeguarding of front-line programmes, particularly in disadvantaged communities.<\/p><p>The Minister is very much aware of the valuable services provided by Sphere 17 regional youth service to young people aged between ten and 21 years in areas such as Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood in Dublin 17.  Sphere 17 provides young people with a wide range of programmes and activities, seven days a week which reflect their needs, interests, capacity and age profile.  These programmes and activities include personal and social development with a particular focus on recreation, education and health.  Projects engage with young people in an open, creative and health focused way using a variety of youth friendly approaches.  A team of trained and dedicated staff works with and for young people in the Dublin 17 area supporting them to achieve their potential and contribute positively to their communities.  The Department provides funding to Sphere 17 regional youth service under a number of funding schemes.  These are the SPY scheme, YPFSF rounds 1 and 2 and the LDTF.  Funding of &euro;788,839 has been allocated to Sphere 17 in 2013.<\/p><p>The overall budget of &euro;53.498 million for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 includes capital funding of &euro;1.75 million.  Of this funding up to &euro;1 million is available for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the start-up of new youth cafes.  A total of 95 applications was received under the youth cafe scheme this year, which is being administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department understands that an application for capital funding under this scheme was received from Sphere 17.  The initial appraisal process of the applications received is in the final stages.  It is expected that applications that are successful will go through to the next round of the process and will be notified in the coming weeks.  The final decisions about youth cafes to be funded under this scheme will be made at the end of October 2013.
