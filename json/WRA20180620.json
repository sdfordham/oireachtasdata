Just under 45,000 households have had their housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan &ndash; 33% of those targeted under the 6 year Plan as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Last October, I made it clear that the orientation of local authority social housing\u00a0delivery was to shift towards greater construction activity, including the utilisation of lands in local authority ownership.\u00a0 Good progress has been made in this regard - at the end of 2017, the social housing construction\u00a0programme included 846 schemes (or phases), delivering over 13,400 homes\u00a0&ndash; a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme at end 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I\u00a0advised all local authorities of revised minimum Social Housing Targets both for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021. The targets\u00a0 are based on the proportion of the\u00a0Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) appropriate to each local authority. The results of the 2017 summary show that there were 85,799 households deemed qualified for, and in need of, social housing support, which is a decrease of 6.3% (5,801) in net need compared to the 2016 summary.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, I expect to see nearly 26,000 households having their housing need met, with over 4,400 new build social housing homes to be delivered through local authorities and approved housing bodies, including through the Part V mechanism. As the ambition for social housing construction activity is targeted to continue to increase significantly, it is critical that local authorities, working with\u00a0AHBs,\u00a0focus on developing\u00a0expanded pipelines of new social housing\u00a0build projects. In order to support local authorities and AHBs to deliver, my Department has streamlined its approval processes, established a Delivery Office to provide technical advice, as well as supporting local authorities in acquiring additional staffing resources.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Homelessness, particularly family homelessness, remains a key priority of Government.\u00a0 In 2017, 4,729 individuals exited homelessness, which\u00a0was a 54% increase on the previous year. There are now 21 Family Hubs in place and these are the preferred first response in terms of emergency accommodation, rather than hotels. Through the dedicated efforts of exit teams, 2,080 families left hotels last year, the majority of them moving into homes rather than hubs. While the supply of social housing is ramping up, we will continue to work to find the most suitable and appropriate solutions for homeless families and individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Estates","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[26863\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the work ongoing to develop a policy to expedite the taking in charge of housing estates with developer provided water services infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>The taking-in-charge of housing\u00a0developments is a matter for the relevant local authority under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

The planning process has been de-risked and streamlined through the new Strategic Housing Development process and\u00a0the number of new homes granted planning permissions in Q1 2018 are up by 80% compared to Q1 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the vacant site levy is playing an important role in countering land hoarding and ensuring that key sites are developed without delay.\u00a0 This will be strengthened shortly through new legislation to increase the maximum annual levy from 3% to\u00a07% from 2019 and I will be continuing to keep the operation of the levy under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[26729\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of enhanced leasing scheme units due to be operational in 2018; when the scheme will be open to interested parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>The first call for proposals for the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 33 submissions were received from interested parties, which represents strong interest from the market.

All three sites under the HLI are identified as strategic development and regeneration areas within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022.<\/p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective of Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities, where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation based on income levels. They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas. <\/p>  <p>  The approach which the City Council is taking to the St. Michael&rsquo;s project envisages the potential to yield\u00a0over 400\u00a0mixed-tenure homes and\u00a0the City Council has determined that the homes will be provided on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable, and 50% private tenure mix. The council has also agreed the methodology for community consultation, as set out in the feasibility study presented\u00a0through\u00a0a community consultative forum.<\/p>  <p>  In line with good governance procedures, a project board, which includes representation from my Department and the National Development Finance Agency, has been established and is working to progress the development of this site.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the delivery of affordable homes from this site, while it is ultimately a matter for the\u00a0City Council to decide whether these are to be affordable homes to purchase or are delivered as cost-rental homes, I firmly believe that there is a need to ensure that the rental sector, particularly in our cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable.\u00a0 In order to do this, we need to invest in a different type of rental offering, a so called cost-rental sector which operates between the social and private market sectors.\u00a0In that regard, we\u00a0are learning from pilot projects and the examination of similar models operating elsewhere. <\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council, my Department and the NDFA have at this point carried out detailed modelling and financial appraisal on this site, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development.

As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p><p>While\u00a0my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p><p>However, I and my predecessors, have supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems such as the Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) and\u00a0the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks (June 2017). I also published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings (August 2017), which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework\u00a0is also\u00a0of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Where\u00a0apartment buildings that are defective from a fire safety perspective\u00a0come to the attention of the\u00a0local authority fire services, they\u00a0work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved\u00a0to minimise the risk to\u00a0life. Actions are taken on the basis of case by case fire safety assessments.<\/p><p>Finally, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and in\u00a0recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management\u00a0in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead\u00a0a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.\u00a0 The Task Force's report,\u00a0which was published recently, is available at the following link: <\/p><p>. <\/p><p>The report makes a\u00a0number of recommendations in relation to fire safety in\u00a0apartment buildings, including, including:<\/p><p>- the\u00a0registration of fire stopping\u00a0sub-contractors;<\/p><p>- the\u00a0roles and responsibilities of Building Management Companies\u00a0e.g.\u00a0to\u00a0review\u00a0and maintain fire safety arrangements,\u00a0to keep a\u00a0Fire Safety Register,\u00a0to advise residents\u00a0on what\u00a0to\u00a0do in the event of a fire alarm\u00a0(in particular the evacuation arrangements); and<\/p><p>- that\u00a0local authority\u00a0Fire Services should offer training to Building Management \u00a0Companies on key life safety issues.<\/p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has been mandated to carry through the recommendations of the report which are within my Department's remit and to oversee and report on the implementation of the report's other recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000069#WRA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":75,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":76,"content":"<p>Question No. 55 answered with Question No. 53.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[26888\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenancies will be redefined in a way that acknowledges that these tenancies are not the same as local authority tenancies (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>Demand for social housing is met in a variety of ways including through the private rental sector under schemes such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.\u00a0 Using a variety of mechanisms to deliver social housing makes social housing supports more responsive and flexible, ensures a better mix between private and social housing and creates more sustainable communities.<\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs, in their area of choice.

These measures include reductions in the use of fossil fuel systems and an increase in the use of renewable energy. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department has lead responsibility for implementing the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This Directive sets the requirements at an EU level for Member States to improve the energy performance of buildings and to make an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0 Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building, or &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo;, as a building that has a very high energy performance and that the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. This definition was incorporated in the Building Regulations 1997 &ndash; 2017 last year through the\u00a0Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to\u00a0the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels. These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimized the additional effort required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  In 2007, Part L was revised to achieve a 40% improvement in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 performance levels for new dwellings and, in addition, a mandatory renewables requirement for new dwellings was also introduced. This review also introduced a requirement that new and replacement fossil fuel boilers should be energy efficient condensing boilers, where practical. <\/p>  <p>  In 2011, Part L of the Building Regulations was further revised to achieve an improvement of 60% in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standard for all new dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0I have recently published a public consultation on further improvements to Part L of the Building Regulations to achieve the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive NZEB performance requirements.\u00a0 My Department is currently reviewing the results of this consultation, and when implemented, \u00a0it will represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction from early 2019, subject to transition arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Under current regulations a typical new dwelling is built to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER). The new Part L performance requirement will equate to a typical new dwelling having a BER of A2.\u00a0 The amended Part L Building Regulations will stipulate that new dwellings can achieve the new standards by making provisions that represent : - <\/p>  <p>- A 70% improvement in energy efficiency for new dwellings (relative\u00a0to 2005 base year standards)<\/p>  <p>- A 70% reduction in CO2   emissions (again relative to the\u00a02005 base year standards), and<\/p>  <p>- 20% renewables as a percentage of total building energy use.<\/p>  <p>  These requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 regulations requires 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.\u00a0\u00a0Very significant progress has, therefore, been made in this area, even before the new initiatives outlined above.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Arising from further improvements to Part L, the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy is expected to accelerate and\u00a0will contribute significantly to meeting Ireland's climate change commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[26865\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the review of the demonstration scheme for group sewerage schemes; when a report will be available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2016-2018 was developed through a working group of key stakeholders involving local authorities, the Water Services Transition Office, Irish Water and\u00a0the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, as well as my Department.

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. <\/p>  <p>  The compliance rate with the statutory objective period has been reduced over the past year due to a number of factors. Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.\u00a0 While, by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output over the whole year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.\u00a0 In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.\u00a0 As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, during this period, there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.\u00a0 For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals in the four months to\u00a0end-April 2018 was 17% greater than the intake over the corresponding period to\u00a0end-April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions.\u00a0\u00a0In mid 2017, the Board acquired\u00a0additional functions in\u00a0determining planning applications for strategic housing developments.\u00a0 A new Strategic Housing Division of the Board was established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.\u00a0 Two additional Board members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the appointments being made in February and June this year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Board now has a complement of 11 members and\u00a0has over 150 staff employed.\u00a0 I am satisfied that the Board has sufficient and necessary resources to deliver effectively and efficiently\u00a0on its important statutory mandate and functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Eligibility","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[26812\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000070#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the income thresholds for local authority housing will be reviewed in view of the fact that some families that are on a low income are being prevented from applying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each\u00a0local authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.

The Department&rsquo;s Management Board Sub Committee on Gender Equality, Equality, and Diversity was first established in 2012 to provide momentum and leadership to efforts to improve gender balance in the Department. In 2017, the Sub Committee&rsquo;s remit was formally expanded to include broader diversity and equality issues as outlined in the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts, together with the issue of discrimination on socio-economic grounds.The Sub Committee (supported by a Gender Equality Action Plan Working Group and a Working Group on Equality and Diversity) is the governance structure for the consideration of equality and diversity issues; policy on these issues is of course led and managed by the Department&rsquo;s human resources team and informed by central Civil Service policies.  The Department also works closely with the Civil Service Management Board in the development of new approaches to gender equality.    Work on gender equality is structured through the Department&rsquo;s Gender Equality Action Plan which sets out a number of key objectives to help improve gender balance at all grades, at home and abroad. Important initiatives taken under the Action Plan include the roll-out of unconscious bias training, mentoring and coaching for women in leadership roles, and the establishment of a Gender Equality Network which organises seminars and discussions on gender open to all staff. <\/p>  <p>  Efforts have specifically been made to ensure gender balance in promotions and particularly at senior positions where inequalities are historically most evident. In 2012, at the establishment of the Sub-Committee, 27% of Counsellors\/Principal Officers in the Department were female. As of 2018, the percentage of female Counsellor\/Principal Officers is 34%, highlighting the success of efforts made by the Department to address inequalities, while also evidencing the need to continue efforts already being implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group on Equality and Diversity has now developed a complementary Action Plan which will be launched shortly and which will drive initiatives around inclusion, equality, and diversity in our human resources approach and in our external and internal communications. As part of the Action Plan, I will shortly be launching the Department&rsquo;s LGBT+ Staff Network. This Network aims to be a supportive space for LGBT+ staff, secondees and their spouses at home or overseas.<\/p>  <p>  There are regular events at the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters to promote gender equality, equality and diversity. In 2017, six events were held and to date there have been four events on issues on gender equality, equality and diversity in 2018.  Events have included topics such as &lsquo;Inclusion and Disability&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gender Equality in Leadership&rsquo;, &lsquo;LGBT+ History&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Diversity in the Diplomatic Service&rsquo;.   As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am committed to communicating our values to our partners around the world and to visible demonstrations of our support for human rights and equality. The Department&rsquo;s diplomatic network and the Irish Aid programme work directly, and in cooperation with, other EU Member States to engage with Governments on a range of governance and human rights issues, including gender equality and the rights of the LGBT+ community. The Human Right Unit in my Department supports embassies in their engagement on these issues, including the provision of appropriate training to staff in advance of their postings overseas. <\/p>  <p>  In March this year Ireland also chaired the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, leading to the adoption of Conclusions which focused on gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I launched a social media awareness campaign on Twitter reiterating Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the rights of LGBT+ individuals and encouraging our global network to show solidarity by supporting the hashtag #FollowTheRainbow. <\/p>  <p>  Many of our embassies have also participated in annual Pride events including most recently Embassies Warsaw, Washington and Zagreb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000072#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000072#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[27021\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000072#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) has been imprisoned under an administrative detention order since 2 July 2017 and has reportedly been denied the right to a fair and public trial; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case of the person concerned, whose administrative detention order has just been renewed for a further period reported to be four months. She has been in administrative detention without trial for a year, having already been detained, under administrative detention and a conviction whose basis was very unclear, for much of the period since April 2015. I understand that she is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is an outlawed group in Israel and considered a terrorist group by the EU. However, no real and credible imputation of personal involvement in violent activities has been made against her.<\/p>  <p>  My view on this case, and on the practice of administrative detention generally, is very clear. While no-one can doubt the particular threats and security concerns which Israel faces, administrative detention should only be used, if at all, in the most serious of cases and in the face of serious and immediate threat. In all other cases, persons should be charged and tried in the courts, able to hear and challenge the evidence against them. No evidence of such a serious and immediate threat has been presented, in a way which would allow the person in question to address it, in this case. <\/p>  <p>  In general, there is serious concern that administrative detention is being applied on an increasingly routine basis against people who are politically active and critical of the occupation of the Palestinian territory, without any evidence being made available to indicate that these individuals constitute a security threat. Such periods of detention are often rolled over and extended indefinitely. <\/p>  <p>  All of these criticisms have been conveyed to the Israeli authorities, most recently in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the Human Rights Council in January of this year, when Ireland reiterated that detainees must have the right to be informed of the charges underlying any detention, have access to legal assistance, and receive a fair trial. Ireland has also been instrumental in having them included in EU Council Conclusions on the situation in Israel and Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  It is incumbent on Israel to charge this person with credible and evidence-based offences, or to release her.

Businesses who make supplies that are charged to VAT are entitled to claim input VAT on their business expenses.\u00a0VAT registered persons are entitled to claim the cost of VAT on the purchase of diesel used in the course of their business, as is the case with most business costs.\u00a0However, section 60 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits VAT deductibility by businesses on certain goods and services which, by their ubiquitous nature, are not easily distinguishable from general non-business use.\u00a0This is for anti-avoidance reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on petrol, as well as expenditure on food, drink, accommodation, and entertainment, is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the petrol or other goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under Article 176 of the EU VAT Directive, Ireland can retain certain restrictions on VAT deductibility that were in place before 1979.\u00a0As VAT input deductibility has been restricted on petrol since 1972, Ireland can retain that block on deductibility. While it is legally possible to apply the normal rules of VAT deductibility to petrol, once the block on deductibility is eased or removed it would not be possible to re-introduce it.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.

background to the closure of  both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in  February 2013.\u00a0Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the  Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,046 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a  new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should  be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a  Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary  legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a  disability to meet their mobility costs.\u00a0 The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the  Spring\/Summer session 2018.\u00a0I can confirm that work on the policy  proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0 The proposals  seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.\u00a0Following  consideration of the matter,\u00a0 it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda on 8 May last.\u00a0 I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a  car, where that car was essential to retain employment.\u00a0The maximum  Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year  period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0Following the closure of the scheme in February  2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers  scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.\u00a0This  scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a  fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify  under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons  with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national  roads and toll bridges.\u00a0Transport Infrastructure Ireland has  responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements  in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons  with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further  improve access to public transport services.\u00a0 Under the National  Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and  Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility  and availability of public transport for people with a

Securing access to existing and new and  innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical  evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated  plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in  adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.

In such situations, it is important and  appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017,  following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.

This report is scheduled for publication during the third quarter of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000077#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000077#WRJ02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Expenditure","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000077#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[27000\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000077#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full year cost of increasing all social welfare payments by &euro;5, &euro;10, &euro;15 and &euro;20, respectively, by payment type, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[27037\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000077#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of increasing all working age payments by &euro;5, &euro;10, &euro;15 and &euro;20 by payment type, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 211 together.<\/p><p>The costings sought by the Deputy are detailed in the following table.<\/p><p><i><i>Cost of varying increases in social welfare payments <\/i><\/i><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Full year cost of a  &euro;5  increase  <\/th><th>Full year cost of a &euro;10 increase  <\/th><th>Full year cost of a &euro;15 increase  <\/th><th>Full year cost of a &euro;20 increase  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Scheme<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Working Age Payments<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Insurance Schemes <\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/er's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Con) Pension<\/td><td>7.98<\/td><td>15.96<\/td><td>23.94<\/td><td>31.92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Benefit<\/td><td>1.08<\/td><td>2.16<\/td><td>3.24<\/td><td>4.32<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>15.44<\/td><td>30.88<\/td><td>46.32<\/td><td>61.76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)<\/td><td>0.28<\/td><td>0.56<\/td><td>0.84<\/td><td>1.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>1.28<\/td><td>2.56<\/td><td>3.84<\/td><td>5.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>14.49<\/td><td>28.98<\/td><td>43.47<\/td><td>57.96<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Injury Benefit<\/td><td>0.42<\/td><td>0.84<\/td><td>1.26<\/td><td>1.68<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>0.28<\/td><td>0.56<\/td><td>0.84<\/td><td>1.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>8.53<\/td><td>17.06<\/td><td>25.59<\/td><td>34.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit<\/td><td>0.71<\/td><td>1.42<\/td><td>2.13<\/td><td>2.84<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health and Safety Benefit<\/td><td>0.02<\/td><td>0.04<\/td><td>0.06<\/td><td>0.08<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity &amp;amp; Adoptive Benefit <\/td><td>5.35<\/td><td>10.7<\/td><td>16.05<\/td><td>21.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit <\/td><td>0.31<\/td><td>0.62<\/td><td>0.93<\/td><td>1.24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Assistance Schemes<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>0.34<\/td><td>0.68<\/td><td>1.02<\/td><td>1.36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/ers or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Con) Pension<\/td><td>0.36<\/td><td>0.72<\/td><td>1.08<\/td><td>1.44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Allowance <\/td><td>0.03<\/td><td>0.06<\/td><td>0.09<\/td><td>0.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One-Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>10.17<\/td><td>20.34<\/td><td>30.51<\/td><td>40.68<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance<\/td><td>11.35<\/td><td>22.7<\/td><td>34.05<\/td><td>45.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Half Rate Carer's Allowance <\/td><td>3.11<\/td><td>6.22<\/td><td>9.33<\/td><td>12.44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)<\/td><td>0.13<\/td><td>0.26<\/td><td>0.39<\/td><td>0.52<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance <\/td><td>38.23<\/td><td>76.47<\/td><td>114.87<\/td><td>153.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance -

Article 3 of the agreement\/contract states that, &ldquo;The Sponsor shall at all times be an independent contractor for all purposes and the relationship of principal and agent shall not exist between the parties and all persons recruited by the sponsor shall be their\/her\/his sole responsibility.&rdquo;  The supervisor is legally in the employment of the local sponsoring organisation.

It will distinguish between operational and capital expenditure, and provide projections of income over the multi-annual period 2020-2024 inclusive, which will align with the next full regulatory period.\u00a0 Subject to my approval of the Strategic Funding Plan, it will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and ultimately feed into future annual estimates and budgetary processes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s next Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support its strategic objectives, as set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan and the forthcoming Strategic Funding Plan, to deliver improvements to water services throughout Ireland where they are needed most. \u00a0Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP)\u00a0published in\u00a0October 2015 already sets out a high level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.\u00a0<\/p><p>Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan, including the forthcoming Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of County Development Plans and Local Area Plans.\u00a0<\/p><p>Irish Water continues to develop and implement a long-term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and wastewater system.\u00a0\u00a0The utility\u00a0is implementing the capital investment programme which prioritises investment decisions to ensure that it utilises available funding most effectively by making investments that deliver\u00a0the best possible improvements to water and wastewater infrastructure and services,\u00a0while maximising value for money.\u00a0<\/p><p>A substantial proportion of investment by the State through Irish Water over the next ten years will be focused on programmes to improve compliance with relevant public health and environmental standards.\u00a0 This will involve implementation of the measures contained within the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021 and the achievement of the outcomes identified. \u00a0<\/p><p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.\u00a0 The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000078#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000078#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[26725\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000078#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the cost rental pilot project has gone out to tender;

In this regard, sanction to borrow for housing land acquisition is submitted by the local authority to my Department, who provide an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules. My Department is currently reviewing that loan approval process.\u00a0<\/p><p>Finally, as regards housing delivery more broadly, the Residential Land Availability Survey 2014, published in February 2015, determined the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for residential development purposes at 31 March 2014 in each local authority area.\u00a0 This survey measured the total amount of lands, whether owned privately or by the local authority, that have been identified for housing development in the various local authority development plans and that are the highest priority for development.<\/p><p>The area of such lands amounted to 17,434 hectares which, given a range of densities appropriate to whether the areas are in small villages or larger towns and cities and as determined by the relevant local authorities, could\u00a0support the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.\u00a0 On that basis, I am satisfied that adequate lands are available to facilitate residential development in line with Rebuilding Ireland.

This has led to a multi-faceted Building Control Reform Agenda, which commenced implementation in 2014 with the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.<\/p><p>Under these Regulations, the owner of a building\u00a0must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he\/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates. The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works,\u00a0which is available at the following link: .\u00a0This has brought clarity and accountability, a focus on compliance with Building Regulations and a new order to bear on construction projects.<\/p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. <\/p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was set up to provide centralised oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. Under this project, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed and rolled out. A Framework for Building Control Authorities was prepared to standardise work practices. A compliance support facility has been established and a training programme is being developed. Also, and most fundamentally, steps are in place for the continued strengthening of the inspection regime in Building Control Authorities to carry out meaningful risk-based targeted inspections of building works. <\/p><p>The Government has also approved the General Scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist sub-contractors. The main objective of the Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations within the Builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist sub-contractors provides consumers with assurance that they are dealing with competent and compliant operators.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These reforms have already brought, and, through their full implementation, will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced\u00a0culture\u00a0of\u00a0compliance with the Building Regulations.<\/p><p>The\u00a0reduced risk\u00a0of defective buildings has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry. These new products are first party insurance policies which cover damage and breaches of building regulations claims, to varying degrees. This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer. This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading.<\/p><p>My Department is planning to\u00a0engage further\u00a0with Departments and Agencies with responsibility for insurance and consumer\u00a0protection\u00a0and industry\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0in order to ensure that homeowners and buyers are aware of products and options that are available to them when purchasing a new home. <\/p><p>However, it is important to note that under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold a central record of building failures that have emerged. However, the Government has supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems such as the Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) and\u00a0the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks (June 2017). I also published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings (August 2017), which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. <\/p><p>Where\u00a0apartment buildings that are defective from a fire safety perspective\u00a0come to the attention of the\u00a0local authority fire services, they\u00a0work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved\u00a0to minimise the risk to\u00a0life. Actions are taken on the basis of case by case fire safety assessments.<\/p><p>Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and in\u00a0recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management\u00a0in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead\u00a0a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.\u00a0 The Task Force's report,\u00a0which was published recently, is available at the following link:<\/p><p>The report makes a\u00a0number of recommendations in relation to fire safety in\u00a0apartment buildings, including, including:\u00a0<\/p><p>- the\u00a0registration of fire stopping\u00a0sub-contractors;<\/p><p>- the\u00a0roles and responsibilities of Building Management Companies\u00a0e.g.\u00a0to\u00a0review\u00a0and maintain fire safety arrangements,\u00a0to keep a\u00a0Fire Safety Register,\u00a0to advise residents\u00a0on what\u00a0to\u00a0do in the event of a fire alarm\u00a0(in particular the evacuation arrangements); and<\/p><p>- that\u00a0local authority\u00a0Fire Services should offer training to Building Management Companies on key life safety issues.<\/p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has been mandated to carry through the recommendations of the report which are within my Department's remit and to oversee and report on the implementation of the report's other recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000078#WRK06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000079#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[27093\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062000079#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of  homeless families in County Kildare;
