During 2011, the numbers employed in the Defence Forces averaged around 9,500, there were 735 civilian employees and 348 civil servants.  In nominal terms, the Department of Defence spent a total of roughly &euro;100 million on allowances.  However, more than half of this figure - &euro;53 million - is accounted for by military service allowance, MSA.  MSA is a universal payment made to all military personnel to compensate them for the unique demands of military life.  MSA is counted as part of the basic pay of military personnel in pay reviews.  The balance of roughly &euro;46 million covers allowances as the term is commonly understood, that is, payments that are made selectively to individuals albeit for widely varying reasons.<\/p><p>  The term \"allowances\" covers a variety of payment types that are very different from each other.  Some are intended to reimburse expenses and do not actually form part of remuneration.  Some payments are made in recognition of particular technical or professional qualifications.  The Defence Forces have to be self-sufficient.  Therefore, in addition to having purely military training and qualifications, the military workforce is extremely diverse and it includes widely differing skills ranging literally from plumbers to pilots.  The pay system has evolved different rates of additional pay to reflect that.  <\/p><p>  Finally, there is a range of allowances that seek to recognise particularly onerous duties whether at home or overseas that fall outside the norms taken into account in setting basic pay.  I wish to emphasise that military personnel may be required to work around the clock, work long hours and remain on duty at weekends.  The Defence Forces do not receive overtime, hence this third category of payment. <\/p><p>  Overall, while there are around 65 separate allowances, it is important to emphasise that many of these allowances are paid to relatively small numbers of personnel.  Almost two thirds of the &euro;46 million is accounted for by the top three categories of allowance, that is, technician pay, &euro;7.7 million; security duty allowances, roughly &euro;10.5 million; and overseas peace support allowances, &euro;10.7 million.  The \"tech\" pay and the security duty allowance had already been selected for review as part of the Defence Sectoral Croke Park Agreement.  Their review has now been subsumed into the larger central initiative and is being addressed with the representative associations in accordance with agreed procedures.<\/p><p>  It  is also important to emphasise that representation in the Defence Forces, compared to other areas of the public service, is a comparatively recent phenomenon.  It was introduced around 1990.  Roughly half of the allowances, 33, date from 1990 or later.  That reflects the influence of the associations which identified discrete groups of military personnel performing duties that either impose more than the normal burden on personnel or that require unique qualifications.  <\/p><p>  Many of the allowances apply to quite small numbers of personnel.  They frequently address circumstances where military personnel are required to perform duties for exceptionally long periods or where changes in technology require personnel to acquire additional qualifications.  For example, an aid to the civil authority allowance compensates personnel who are called out after hours in emergencies such as flooding or bad weather.  An explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, allowance is paid to bomb disposal personnel.<\/p><p>  The committee may wish to note also the ongoing reorganisation, which is a major change in the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  There have been strength reductions across the board.<\/p> <p>The reorganisation has had and will have a very major impact on the lives and future careers of serving and future members of the Defence Forces right across the entire organisation.  This programme has entailed barrack closures and a large-scale reorganisation process affecting thousands of personnel.  There has been a reduction in the number of brigades, from three to two, requiring the redeployment of some 2,000 personnel.  This is in train at present.<\/p><p> Throughout this very challenging period, the modernisation process in defence has been overseen by a sectoral implementation group.  While very difficult issues have surfaced, and very robust negotiations have been necessary, there has been continuing constructive engagement by the representative associations at a particularly difficult time for their members.  The Croke Park agreement has been adhered to in the most difficult of circumstances and it has and is being used to facilitate fundamental and far-reaching reform.  The Government's recent decision on allowances is now in process.  I expect the same constructive response, albeit in the context of robust negotiations.<\/p><p> The committee may wish to note that a small portion - less than 2% - of the approximately &euro;100 million refers to allowance payments to civilian employees and civil servants.  Pay issues in relation to grades employed in more than one Department are dealt with centrally.  These grades are not comprehended by the defence sectoral agreement under the Croke Park agreement but are comprehended by central arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800004#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350551700,"counter":34,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Howard's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350551700,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1350551700,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I invite Colonel Brian O'Keeffe of RACO to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350551700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, I thank the members for the opportunity to address them today.  We welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with our perspective on the matter of allowances in so far as they apply to our members.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces' remuneration structures are a complex mix of pay and allowances.  This reflects the complexity of the organisation itself in terms of the spread of skills and expertise of its members and the range of duties performed by personnel across the three services - the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  The organisation has been described as being like a microcosm of the overall public service.  The Defence Forces have doctors, nurses, engineers, firemen, pilots, sailors, IT specialists, mechanics, teachers and lecturers, logisticians, carpenters, electricians, lawyers, cooks, accountants and more.  Of course, we are also soldiers, sailors and airmen and women with a diverse range of specialised military skills and expertise.  We perform a variety of duties on land, sea and air, at home and overseas, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  It is inevitable that the remuneration structures for such an organisation will be complex and, perhaps, difficult to understand.  We are not unique in this.  Our research indicates that broadly similar structures apply in the armed forces of many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Finland, Austria, Germany, Denmark. Australia and New Zealand.<\/p><p>  A range of allowances and additional pay items may be payable to individual members of the Defence Forces, either on an ongoing basis or periodically.  These relate either to qualifications, skills or expertise or to the nature or duration of particular duties performed.  In general, our allowances are taxable and not pensionable.  A large number were in place before representation was introduced to the Defence Forces, while many were introduced or restructured by the Gleeson commission in 1990.  While RACO's preference would generally be for pay increases over allowances, it has rarely been possible for us to address particular remuneration problems other than through allowances.  There are many reasons for this, not least the fact that the allowances route is often the most cost-effective one for the official side to take.<\/p><p>  We note that the recent review of allowances carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, identified structural weaknesses in the way members of the Defence Forces are paid and that the Government has decided that new pay arrangements will be developed in the medium term.  We look forward to making a significant and positive contribution to the development of more effective structures.  However, we caution that it will not be an easy task.  It is not simply a matter of picking a few allowances to consolidate into pay and abandoning the rest.<\/p><p>  More immediately, the Department of Defence has recently made proposals to withdraw certain allowances from current beneficiaries.  Discussions on this matter have opened as part of the process provided by the Croke Park agreement.  We will engage with this process and hope that we can reach a speedy conclusion.<\/p><p>  My association is totally committed to the letter and spirit of the Croke Park agreement.  The Defence Forces are delivering on all elements of the action plan for our sector.  Currently, the most challenging item is the reduction of the number of Army brigades from three to two.  Under this reorganisation many individual members of all ranks face redeployment to new locations or significant retraining to enable them to operate in new roles.  They also face a serious reduction in career advancement opportunities through the reduction in appointments.  In addition, the change involves a massive effort in administration, logistics and training.  The plan for this reorganisation was only finalised in July but the new organisation will he in place by the first of November, with personnel filling posts in their new units.  Of course, the retraining and up-skilling process will continue way beyond that.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces have been described as a model of public service transformation.  The evidence of the past 20 years supports this description.  Over this period, a process of continuous and radical change has transformed the organisation into one that is acknowledged internationally as being world-class.  We have delayered and fundamentally restructured at every level, significantly reduced the number of barracks occupied, refocused our training, overhauled all of our administrative systems and processes, and brought our equipment right up to date through major re-equipping programmes.  These have been funded primarily by payroll savings achieved through reduction in headcount.  From 2001 to 2009, as public service numbers generally increased, the strength of the Defence Forces fell by more than 11%.  This resulted in annual payroll savings conservatively estimated at &euro;57 million in current terms.  This followed on from a process in the 1990s that had resulted in a 20% reduction in military numbers during that decade.  That is a 28% reduction in numbers since 1990.<\/p><p>  We recognise that the issue of allowances is a serious one and that the overall costs are very significant.  However, it has been dispiriting and demoralising for our members to see the considerable attention paid in the media and elsewhere to individual allowances paid to some members of the forces of as little as &euro;27 per year when there is no coverage of the fact that headcount reductions since 1990 have yielded payroll savings of upwards of &euro;170 million a year.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee once again for the opportunity to address it on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1350551700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Can we publish Mr. O'Keeffe's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350551700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1350551700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Gerry Rooney of PDFORRA to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350551700,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for extending the opportunity to PDFORRA to come here this morning and outline its position in relation to the allowances paid to its members.  PDFORRA represents the 8,000 soldiers, sailors and aircrew of the Permanent Defence Force on all matters concerning pay and conditions.  PDFORRA is established under the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 and specifically DFR S6.  PDFORRA negotiates and consults, in the main, through an agreed conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Unlike fully fledged trade unions, PDFORRA and its members have no right to engage in any form of industrial action whatsoever. Moreover, PDFORRA is prevented from joining the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.<\/p><p>  PDFORRA members receive very modest levels of pay.  In the case of the most common rank, that of private, the basic annual rate rises to &euro;34,910 at the top of the scale.  In recent years, PDFORRA members have been subject to a reduction in the rates of pay and allowances of approximately 6%, a pension-related deduction of a similar level, and increased tax payments which cumulatively will see some members pay cut by 20%.  Many of our members are struggling to balance family budgets and cope with mortgage debts and payments, and they now need family income supplement to survive.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces and their members have been delivering significant reform since the mid-1990s, and this process is continuing through the Croke Park agreement.  The numbers have dropped from 12,750 in 1996 to an authorised strength of 9,500 today.  The number of barracks has reduced from 29 to 14, representing a 50% decrease, and the organisation has been restructured by reducing its administrative and support functions and by reducing its number of brigades to two.<\/p><p>  As a proportion of GDP, Ireland's defence expenditure, at just over 0.5%, is among the lowest of the 27 EU member states.  The EU average expenditure as a percentage of GDP is 1.69%.<\/p><p>  PDFORRA and its members have delivered everything that has been asked of them under the Croke Park agreement.  This has had a significant impact on sections of the membership of the same order as the pay cuts and pension-related deductions.  For example, the closure of certain barracks and the redeployment of the soldiers concerned to other posts will see them bear additional travel costs of up &euro;4,000 per annum.  This burden will be repeated in the context of the current reorganisation process.<\/p> <p> At the heart of the Croke Park agreement is the deal that pay will not be cut in exchange for co-operation with a modernisation and change agenda.  As the modernisation and change agenda is being delivered, pay therefore should not be cut - and this should include allowances.  No distinction should be made regarding allowances as they are part of basic or core pay.  This is especially the case given the particular circumstances that apply in the Defence Forces.  The particular circumstances to which I refer are the fact that members of the Defence Forces do not receive overtime or unsocial hours payments for working additional or unsocial hours.  Ordinary members of the Defence Forces who work long or unsocial hours or both are rewarded on many but not all occasions by way of allowances.<\/p><p> A large number of allowances are paid to members of the Defence Forces and this has attracted a lot of media comment.  However, many of the allowances are intended to cover the same thing in different circumstances.  For example, in most of the country, additional attendance and unsocial hours are rewarded by the payment of security duty allowance but in the original Border units, it was rewarded by Border allowance.  When additional attendance or unsocial hours are worked in the context of the State's prisons, prison duty allowance is paid and when it is worked in the context of the explosive ordnance threat, explosive ordnance disposal allowance is paid.  In the Naval Service, patrol duty allowance fulfils this function while in the Air Corps, flying pay is the relevant allowance.  When called on to provide aid to the civil authority, aid to the civil authority allowance may then be paid and similarly, when such aid to the civil authority arises from industrial action, maintenance of essential services allowance may be paid.  Other allowances also are paid to compensate for long or additional hours of attendance or both.  The allowance bill for all members of the Defence Forces amounts to approximately 8.5% of the total pay bill.<\/p><p> Historically, these allowances emerged in circumstances where soldiers, sailors and air crew were required to work alongside garda&iacute;, prison officers, customs officials and local authority workers who received overtime and unsocial hours payments.  At that time, the existing pay system did not provide compensation for additional hours of attendance and the allowances that evolved were an effort to do this without conceding overtime.  There are of course occasions where no additional payments are made for extra attendance or working unsocial hours and those concerned receive no additional payments but may get compensatory time off in lieu.  Other allowances paid in the Defence Forces are equally as justified as those already mentioned.  Typically they are paid to individuals who carry out the duties of a higher rank or have a specific skill which is not rewarded through the existing pay structure.  It is worth noting that internationally, many armed forces pay out a substantial number of allowances and that much of this can be attributed to compensation for long and unsocial hours.<\/p><p> In summation, the allowance system in the Defence Force is largely driven by a necessity to reward members of the Defence Forces for working long or unsocial hours or both without conceding the payment of overtime.  The allowances are basic pay and are something our members cannot do without, given the difficult financial circumstances in which they now find themselves.  Finally, I thank the committee for giving PDFORRA the opportunity to put forward the position of our members in respect of their pay and allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800005#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Rooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350552300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rooney.

To put this in context, the committee is inquiring into the area of allowances within the public sector.  I seek a complete understanding, whereby members and witnesses both learn in terms of the exercise and where members ascertain which allowances comprise core pay and gain a general appreciation of how they have evolved.  I am unsure whether the public currently has full detailed knowledge of how the structures of the allowances work and how they have evolved over time.  Certainly, when looking through the allowances, many of the lower-end ones make a significant difference in terms of core pay.  I had the opportunity to look through the various presentations and reports and found a number of features to be striking.  Mr. Howard should explain how approximately 100 allowances came about over the years.  There are approximately 65 within the Army itself and a further 35 between the civilian employees and the Civil Service.  Mr. Howard should explain how this evolved over time.  I note the first allowance in the Army was for the equitation school back in 1922 and I presume it still is in place.  Various other allowances have been introduced and Mr. Howard made reference to the years.  It strikes me that many public sector allowances appear to be large in number and quite cumbersome.  Moreover, many of them have been there for many years and a lot of them constitute core pay.  Mr. Howard should provide members with an understanding of how this has evolved.  Could some of the allowances be amalgamated?  I note Mr. Howard made reference to discussions being under way in that area.<\/p><p>  As for enlisted personnel, from 1 January a private now starts on &euro;220.37 per week, which is below the minimum wage.  How has that position evolved?  Are allowances also built into that rate and what is the basis for it?  Another issue I wished to raise concerned allowances and pensions.  How many allowances are built in for pension entitlements?  I again am attempting to distinguish between core pay and specific allowances.  I have two further items I will raise with Mr. Howard.  In respect of the level of training within the Army, are the courses undertaken and qualifications gained by Army personnel at FETAC or HETAC level?  My understanding regarding people leaving the Army is it takes 21 years before one can get to a point at which one can leave.  I seek general information on the type of qualifications gained.  On a general note, the representative bodies referred to the level of reorganisation that is taking within the Army.  In general, how do they perceive morale to be among Army personnel at present?  I invite Mr. Howard to address these points.  I seek an understanding of how it came about that effectively, there are 100 allowances within the Department of Defence and the Army.  I wish to understand the reason some of the aforementioned allowances were not simply reclassified as core pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800006#N00500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350552300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I hope I am not overturning anyone's position by making this point but perhaps it is easier to say this by way of explanation.  The reason for this was for the fear of repercussive effects.  In other words, what makes any public sector employer different from a private sector employer is that other organisations are watching anything it does.  At that time in particular, there was a great fear that were any group to receive an increase in basic pay, it would spill out into other groups.  This often has informed the way in which the pay structure has developed.

I have looked back through the allowances, including the years they were introduced, and it strikes me that they have done a disservice to people working in the Army.  There is a perception that there is a myriad of allowances when in fact the military service allowance applies to virtually everyone in the Army.  It has been there since 1979, over 30 years, and clearly that is core pay.  As regards the public perception of Army pay structures, would it not make more sense to find another method without these large numbers of allowances?

The allowances that are paid evolved when the associations were established just as pay negotiation was becoming centralised.  Once the associations came into that system they were required to sign up to national pay agreements which provided that only small claims could be submitted.  So the only avenue open to the associations to advance a claim if they had a group of people was to make a small claim which was ring-fenced for that group.  On the management side, we were under what I would call the tyranny of repercussive effects.  If the associations brought to our attention a particular group with a problem we dealt only with that particular group and we isolated it.  It was a cost-containing strategy by management.  The price we may have paid for it was administrative complexity, but the alternative - if one had allowances of general application and did something that could spread beyond our own domain - could have set off very expensive repercussive effects.  Therefore there was a rational managerial strategy to contain costs but we paid a price for it.<\/p><p>  Part of the difficulty is that, for policy reasons, we cannot pay overtime.  That is a fundamental and long-standing policy.  It is in the nature of military service that such personnel have to be available for service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Given that they are in military service, they are exempted from the Working Time Directive and health and safety legislation.  When they came in with particular groups, many of whom genuinely had merit, we had to deal with them by way of allowance because it was the only instrument available.  In addition, if we had sought to deal with it under basic pay the repercussions would have been serious and probably against the public interest in the long term.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right in that the system we have now evolved is complex.  In the medium term there is scope for amalgamation, but I would caution that it is not necessarily going to give a big return in terms of money.

We have to recognise that in their basic pay because it is universal for all of them.  However, we must do so in a way that is ring-fenced so that somebody else somewhere else cannot say \"I'm an electrician.  A soldier who is an electrician gets paid more than I do\".

To pick up on the point made by Deputy Donohoe, this is a very useful process and a good reflection on the Oireachtas.  A criticism of social partnership in previous years was how the Oireachtas was never allowed comment on social partnership or public sector reform and everything was done behind closed doors with announcements made with much fanfare.  This is a much healthier process.  While we do not make the decisions and negotiations must continue in private, we can make a positive and constructive contribution.  Having the representative bodies before the committee is particularly useful and I thank them for attending.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donohoe put his finger on it; the fact we are calling these \"allowances\" is the problem.  Looking at allowances across the public sector and in particular with regard to the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, they break down into three categories.  One category is money reimbursed to people for expenses they incur when doing their job and once this is reasonable most people understand it.  The next category is where people carry out an additional task, take on an additional responsibility or obtain an additional skill they receive an extra payment for it, and this is what we should be trying to do in the public sector and it is what is done in the private sector.  There are a number of such payments to the Defence Forces and my colleagues have referred to them.<\/p><p>  The third category is where the difficulty arises and we can broadly categorise it as \"other\".  It is the failure of public policy to grasp the nettle of public sector pay, particularly with regard to the Defence Forces.  I would go so far as to say to RACO and PDFORRA that our Defence Forces have been badly served by a breakdown in public service policy.  I learned a new phrase from Mr. Howard today, \"the tyranny of repercussive effects\", which I may explore with him.  It says a great deal about how our policy of dealing with the public sector has evolved.  I take from this that we have paralysis within the public service whereby we cannot address the legitimate pay needs of some members of our Defence Forces who earn ridiculously low sums of money for fear it would have a knock-on domino effect and everyone in the public sector will be jumping up and down looking for more money.

It is useful to have this information before us.<\/p><p>  Another dilemma presents.  I ask the delegates to follow my logic.  It makes no more sense to pay a military service allowance to military people than it does to pay pilots an allowance for flying.  That is what they do.  The presentation of these allowances is important.  Some of the delegates mentioned morale within the ranks.  It is important that those serving in a military with military discipline and who are exempted from basic things that other people take for granted, be it representation in ICTU, coverage by health and safety legislation, etc., are protected by the system that they serve.  I mean this in the most positive of ways.<\/p><p>  I agree with other members, in that the allowances' names are misleading in the most benign way.  They also damage the reputation of the Defence Forces.  Mr. Howard has explained the history of the situation and I accept that it was a hodge-podge arrangement put together with the best of intentions.  However, I hope that it is abundantly clear that this is not a situation that can continue.  It cannot be logically explained.  Archaic allowances need to be stripped away and people must be paid properly.  For those following this part of our examination of allowances, the main revelation will be how poorly paid privates are, for example.  It is scandalous.  In any other sector, their pay would be viewed as slave wages.  Not only is it unacceptable, but it is also unwise of the State to pay people so poorly for the evident reasons, for example the nature of their tasks, our reliance on them for security and how the security of the State hinges on the quality of service at every level.<\/p> <p>Those levels of pay cannot be stood over.  The situation of supplementing deplorably low basic pay levels with the military service allowance is unacceptable.  I do not accept either the argument of the law of unintended consequences in terms of people claiming that because an engineer in the Army is getting X he or she should get the same.  It is self evident why the Defence Forces, in this sector in particular, are an exceptional case.  We have no difficulty making the exception in respect of some of the other areas I mentioned.

It is a response to something that was actually happening in terms of leap frogging.  Some groups within the public service were believed to have succeeded in catapulting their pay up the system by watching what other people got and then being creative in terms of presenting a case for why they should get it.  The fear and concern was based on events that occurred, although some time back.  We are in a vastly different place now.  <\/p><p>  During the 1990s and the noughties, when centralised pay determination mechanisms and agreements such as benchmarking 1 and 2 existed - I must emphasise at this point that this is national pay policy and I am only responsible for what goes on in the defence domain - links were established between the Defence Forces and particular key marker grades within the public and Civil Service so that that when the latter obtained increases others elsewhere also got them.

Approximately six months ago I had the privilege of visiting the equitation school at McKee Barracks and seeing what a wonderful facility it is and the work it does.  Allowance No. 59 is a special uniform allowance for officers of or attached to the equitation school.  This illustrates my point.  When I met the officers they were wearing different uniforms because they do different work to the other officers.  They are getting paid an allowance but are not benefitting, at least from what I saw, as the allowance goes to purchasing different equipment and uniforms.  Is this not part of what we must refine?

We set out this morning with some concern as to how the meeting might work out because the Accounting Officer and the two representative organisations are present but we did not want to get into a position where we would interfere with negotiations or begin to negotiate publicly on allowances.  The meeting we had earlier, with the Secretary General of the Department, was most helpful.  Some of the members have commented on how helpful it was, as well as the meeting here.<\/p><p>  There is a mystery which is grossly misunderstood relating to how the allowances are described, what they are for and, in the case of the Defence Forces, the poor pay, some of which is core pay.  If the process entered into this morning helps to take some of that mystery away and encourages those who are negotiating to a point where they see that the public wishes to understand what is going on and who is being paid what, there can be a better judgment call.  If agreement cannot be reached on what is to be paid, the process can nonetheless be clarified for the public in what would be a helpful act.  If the negotiations can be as open and constructive as this exchange this morning, they will be most helpful in reaching some sort of a positive conclusion for those who serve and those who administer.  It would also be helpful for us on the Committee of Public Accounts, who represent the public and seek a greater understanding of what is going on.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donohoe raised the point about the different questions and the table emerging from those.  That came from the questions put by the clerk and officials of the committee, which gave us a greater understanding.  That is also helpful.  I hope other Accounting Officers and other representative groups could look at this meeting, as there is much to be learned from the very positive exchanges that can take place at a public accounts committee meeting and how helpful can be those exchanges.  That applies not just to this process but to others which will come afterwards.  It was a positive exchange of information that will be helpful for everybody.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses and members - who did their homework, put questions and extracted information in a constructive and helpful manner - for their part in the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101800014#V01500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1350557700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.\r\n  The committee adjourned at 1.30 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 October 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection","time":1350550800,"counter":225},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 10:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Robert Dowds,* Senator Jim D'Arcy, Deputy Derek Keating, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, Senator Marie Moloney.

I understand the body's operational title will be Quality and Qualifications Ireland, or QQI, so I will use that acronym today.  My written submission has already been made available to the members so I will briefly highlight four main points relating to my experience, my vision for QQI, the key challenges the authority may face, and some thoughts on the role of the chair.<\/p><p>  I have had a keen interest and considerable experience in the areas of education and qualification systems for many years.  Currently I am a retired European official and I wish to put my skills and knowledge to use on a voluntary basis.  In particular, I am available to put my energy, time and expertise into some active role in the area of education and qualifications.  It was for this reason I applied ten months ago through the publicly advertised process to be appointed a member of the QQI board.<\/p><p>  The members have received a copy of my <i>curriculum vitae<\/i> so today I will only focus on those aspects of my career in education and public sector management most relevant to the chair of QQI.  Before returning to Ireland in November 2010, I was a head of unit in the European Commission with responsibility for the development of the EU's lifelong learning policy.  This included in particular the development and management of the European qualifications framework for lifelong learning, which is one of the most influential of the EU's initiatives facilitating co-operation, transparency and mobility in the field of education and training.  I was also responsible for the development of the EU's overall framework for co-operation and exchange of good policy and practice in education and training, including leading and chairing key EU-level advisory and co-ordination committees in the field of qualifications and education, as well as membership of the boards of EU vocational training agencies.<\/p><p>  The earlier part of my career was in financial management, having qualified in 1970 as an Irish chartered accountant.  I initially worked in the private sector in auditing, accounting and management consultancy before joining the EU's audit and budgetary planning services.  This experience, skill and knowledge is very pertinent to the role of chairperson, particularly in current times, when we have a very significant focus on good governance and value for money.<\/p><p>  I will turn to my vision for the future of QQI.  The QQI will shortly be established under the recently enacted Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.  The new authority will take on the functions currently performed by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, and the Irish Universities Quality Board.  These four bodies have respectively and collectively laid strong foundations in this area since 2001 and 2002.  For example, they developed and implemented the national framework of qualifications, initiated award standards in external quality assurance of educational providers and programmes and facilitated the access, transfer and progression of learners within the framework.<\/p><p>  Since the authority was first announced in 2008 and within the context of public sector reform, the four bodies, led by Dr. Padraig Walsh, have made significant progress in establishing the new organisation.  The amalgamation process has resulted in efficiencies, producing a significant cost saving and reduction in staff numbers.  Current staff have already been appointed to new positions within a new organisational structure.<\/p><p>  My vision is for the new QQI authority to build on these impressive foundations and establish a more integrated, coherent and relevant qualifications and quality assurance system which will meet the needs of all learners or potential learners, whether they are unemployed, employed, in training or in education in an even more effective way so we can be equipped to respond to post-recession in Ireland and beyond in a state of readiness, with a well educated, qualified and confident work force.  It is crucial that the new organisation ensures that all learners or potential learners have access to appropriate and timely information.  It is equally important that learners are confident in the programmes of education and training recognised within the framework, and that they are given assurances that their qualifications are recognised within and outside the State for the purposes of employment or gaining access to further education and training opportunities.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Act, QQI will be independent in the performance of its functions as a qualifications and quality assurance agency.  It will deliver a high-quality service to and have a strong relationship with providers in further and higher education and training, whether in the private or public sector.  This is a vision that combines operational integrity and independence with an holistic and unified approach to working with providers to achieve the highest standards possible.  It is a vision that I both share and endorse.<\/p><p>  The new authority will face several short to medium-term challenges in order to complete the final stages of the amalgamation process and start fulfilling its functions as set out in the Act.  For example, it must prepare and obtain consensus for the adoption of a strategic plan with a clearly defined rationale and goals that will provide direction and ensure measurement performance.  We must build an identity and foster an organisational culture for QQI that is conducive to learning, development, growth and excellence.  We must establish revised quality assurance and qualifications procedures for providers, programmes and awards which are fit for purpose, integrated and coherent across both further and higher education sectors.  The body must develop new policies and procedures, particularly on a code of practice for international learners, as well as an international education mark.  QQI must also engage actively in the ongoing reform process in education and training, including the development of effective relationships with the new stakeholders and institutions emerging, such as SOLAS, the local education and training boards and any future technological universities.<\/p> <p>In meeting these challenges the new authority is fortunate to have a very well qualified, experienced and dedicated group of staff led by Dr. Walsh, who has been appointed chief executive designate of QQI by the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p> Finally, I will comment briefly on my view of the role of chair<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the board of QQI.  The chair of a board of any large organisation is a challenging role with considerable responsibility, particularly in these economic times.  I see my role as providing the necessary leadership, in accordance with the code of good governance, to ensure the board is clear about its mandate and that it effectively functions to provide strategic guidance while also monitoring the activities and effectiveness of the authority to ensure the highest operational standards of service are achieved.  I will work very closely with the chief executive and will cultivate and rely on the co-operation, expertise and independent judgment of the board members to assist me in my role, duties and tasks.  I look forward to working with the new board after my appointment.  Our collective mission will be to promote the success of the new authority in fulfilling its functions under the Act in the interests of all learners and in accordance with the objectives set by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101800003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Clark","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350551400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I wish him and the new organisation well.<\/p><p>  This is a welcome development.  Yesterday, the D&aacute;il held the Second Stage debate on the Education and Training Boards Bill, which is an important part of the reform of our education and training sector.  The establishment of the QQI is also very welcome.  It is a sensible move to amalgamate the four organisations that existed in the past and streamline the process of awarding educational qualifications in this country.  In terms of the educational framework, the QQI will take over the role of four organisations.  What will its relationship be with the universities and the NUI?  What other organisations, if any, will be involved in awarding qualifications that the QQI will engage with in that regard?  I understand that the NUI will continue to award its own degrees at third level.

Often the challenge is to bring people with us and to face up to accusations of reform for the sake of reform.

I am looking forward to this challenge and responsibility.  It is an exciting time to be involved in education and training in Ireland after having been away for several years.  Given the reforms that are taking place, the QQI will engage actively, in accordance with the Act, with the other stakeholders and institutions which exist and which will emerge as part of the developments in education and training.  The Deputy asked about the bodies and stakeholders to which I am referring.  There is a range in the area of further education and training.  SOLAS will be established and the development of the vocational education committees into education and training boards will be crucial in the reform of further education, vocational education and training.  QQI will work closely with them.<\/p><p>  In the area of higher education, the Act provides that the authority will consult with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, particularly in respect of its functions in quality assurance, access, transfer and progression, in so far as those functions relate to the institutes of higher education.  The HEA's role as a statutory planning and policy development body for higher education and as the funding authority for the universities and the institutes of technology is unchanged by the Act.  The new authority will be responsible for the external review of the procedures for quality assurance and access, transfer and progression which are established by HEA-funded institutions.  I should stress that the authority's role in respect of quality assurance in higher education in previously established universities and providers generally will be simply to act as an external quality assurance agency which mirrors the review provisions currently set out in the Universities Act 1997.  Until now the Irish Universities Quality Board has had a key role to play in quality assurance.  It was established by the seven universities' governing authorities in 2002.  The new authority will take over and continue the quality assurance role of the Irish Universities Quality Board in the university sector.  In that respect, it will seek to build on the infrastructure that is already in place.<\/p><p>  The other bodies that are important stakeholders for the QQI will be the institutes of technology and any future technological university.  That is a very important sector for the new authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101800004#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Clark"},{"type":"speech","time":1350551400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions.  You said the authority has a role in respect of access, transfer and progression.<\/p> <p>When I was looking up some information during the summer, I noticed that people from Cork College of Commerce could transfer to the UCC law degree course if they obtained a certain grade.  They then have a qualification in law and business studies.  We need to see more of this in order that people can move from a VEC school to take the second year of a law degree course in Trinity College, Dublin or any other university.  Such progression should be possible.  Some standard should be set across the board.  Will the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland have powers to force universities to adopt such an approach?<\/p><p> I am not clear on what is meant by \"international learners\".  Is it people who come here from other countries, or is it people from here moving to other countries?

This was a particular concern of mine in my previous career, that is, to promote lifelong learning and a seamless transfer and progression in order that the framework would provide learning pathways without dead ends for individuals.  It should be person-centred.  The Act establishing the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland strengthens the provisions relating to access, transfer and progression and the national framework of qualifications.  This applies across the board - to higher education and further education institutions.  Under the Act, all providers should have access, transfer and progression policies in place, while respecting the autonomy of universities.  It is important to stress the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland will not approve these procedures, but it will be consulted on them.  I am convinced the new authority will have a strong role to promote parity of esteem between further education and higher education institutions and promote and support access, transfer and progression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101800005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Clark"},{"type":"speech","time":1350552000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>What about international learners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101800005#D00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350552000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>International learners are foreign students coming to Ireland.

However, we can learn from the past when designing the rules.  That is what has happened.  There is now general agreement that what were deemed to be surpluses when one thought the country was going very well were not structural surpluses at all.  There were so many transactional taxes in the mix that one was looking at structural deficits.  There was a misunderstanding of what was the actual position.  The concept of structural surpluses and deficits has only recently come into the general debate in the D&aacute;il.  If it had been included in the debate at the time arising from fiscal rules, the Government of the day might have had a different take on what was happening.  There was no doubt it genuinely believed things were going very well.

The figures were accepted by the European Union; they were not questioned.  It is a false premise to argue that this section which deals with the two basic rules of the austerity treaty - the debt rule and the deficit rule - would have prevented the collapse.  It would not have done so.  Up to 2008 we were being cheered on by the European Union because we had surpluses.  The Minister has made a valid point about the structural surplus, which was not actually a surplus and should have been calculated differently.  During the treaty debate the question was asked many times as to how one could define a structural surplus or deficit.  That is what we are seeking to include in the Bill in order that we reach a structural deficit target of 0.5%.  Who will define the model to be used in calculating the structural deficit?

The requirements of the debt rule are already law under EU Regulation 1467\/97, as amended under the European six-pack of reforms.  However, as the debt rule is specifically included in the stability treaty, we are providing for its implementation in domestic law through this Bill.  The text accomplishes this by direct reference to the relevant EU regulation.  This eliminates the possibility of drafting a provision that could be inconsistent, and ensures better adherence to the regulation.  The EU regulation states that debt in excess of the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio must be reduced by at least one-twentieth per year based on changes over the last three years.  It goes on to provide for a transition period for member states, including Ireland, that were subject to an excessive deficit procedure on 8 November 2011.  This transition period means that the general rule will only apply three years after the correction of the existing excessive deficit.  Our existing excessive deficit will be corrected in 2015 when our general Government deficit is targeted to be just under 3% of GDP.  This means that the one-twentieth rule will apply in 2019, not 2018.  In the meantime, it is required that there be satisfactory progress in reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and this will be assessed by the Commission and ECOFIN.<\/p><p>  As to the Department's estimates of the future growth rates, it is difficult enough to forecast growth rates for a short period ahead.<\/p> <p>There is quite a variation among the forecasts, even for the remainder of this year.  The IMF forecast is 0.5% or 0.6% and our budgetary forecast is 0.7%, whereas the ESRI, which is a very reputable organisation, is forecasting 1.8% this year.  That seems to be the outlier.  When one projects out to 2019, it becomes difficult.  The Central Bank and the fiscal council has conducted an analysis which suggests that complying with the budgetary rule will also ensure that we comply with the debt rule.  In other words, they expect sufficient growth within the system to avoid the need for direct action as we approach 2019.  These statements are tenuous, however, and if one examines the current position one will see a number of moving parts over a much shorter period than between autumn 2012 and spring 2019, which is a long stretch of time in the context of our current crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800004#C02600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350566400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Section 4 does not include the condition in section 3 which allows the budgetary rule to be waived in exceptional circumstances.

At the minute, the plan only includes compliance with the budgetary rule, specifying annual targets, the size and nature of the revenue and expenditure measures being taken and outlining how the expenditure measures will be taken and how they will relate to different sub-sectors.  While that is required to meet the rules within the treaty, it does not negate or rule out the fact that we can include in the plan how it would lead to economic growth, jobs creation and the delivery of high quality public services.

This echoes what I have already said, namely, that we need to take cognisance of what is happening to people and that while it is all fine and well to attempt to reach these targets, we must also bear in mind how these measures will contribute to Government-stated objectives.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert in page 7 of the Bill, between lines 14 and 15, a subsection stipulating that all revenue and expenditure measures contained in the plan must be subject to equality and anti-poverty impact assessments, the details of which will be published as appendices to the plan.  Under this legislation and the treaty to which we have signed up, the Government will be compelled to put this plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This plan will include the nature and size of the revenue and expenditure measures to be taken.  This is similar to what is in the troika plan, namely, how much money will be raised in tax and how much money will be cut from spending.  It will also include the sub-sectors where these revenue and expenditure measures will take place.  Like the troika plan, it will identify either social welfare, a household tax or other measures.  However, while plans may be inching towards reaching their targets, they are failing in respect of the wider economy and the citizens.  Nobody should shy away from the idea of having such a plan equality-proofed and subject to an anti-poverty impact assessment, particularly in a week where the Department of Social Protection released a report showing that one in ten people are suffering from food poverty.  It is crucial that this type of assessment be carried out regarding what is happening to individuals.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 9 is very simple and stipulates that the plan would require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There has been considerable discussion and fancy footwork about reforming these institutions and ensuring the Opposition has a role to play and functions are enhanced.  As I said on Second Stage, this plan is very similar to the troika plan.  With regard to specifying the period over which these adjustments will apply, will it be one year or two, three or four years?  The plan is also very similar to the troika plan in that it specifies the annual targets, the revenue and expenditure measures to be taken and the sub-sectors in which they are to be taken.  It is crucially important that this plan would have the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas so amendment No. 9 says the plan shall only be adopted following the approval of the Oireachtas.  Again, it is not something anybody should shy away from.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 10 relates to subsection (5) which stipulates that if the Government considers that a failure to comply with the budgetary rule is likely to occur, it may, within two months, prepare and lay a statement before the D&aacute;il, outlining the steps the Government intends to take to avoid such a failure.  Given that previous amendments that have been ruled out of order, I am surprised this one has not been ruled out of order.  This amendment deletes that line and changes the emphasis.  It proposes to delete all words including \"outlining\" in line 32 down to and including \"failure\" in line 33 and substitute the following: \"outlining the reasons it considers non-compliance with the budgetary rule to be in the best social and economic interests of the citizens and the state\".  It changes the focus and says that if we believe the rules are not to be complied with, a statement should be laid before the D&aacute;il stating why the Government believes it is in the best interests of the State and the citizens not to comply with the budgetary rules at this point in time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800006#E01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1350567000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The policy issues raised in these amendments are of a much wider scope than the substance of the Bill.  The Deputy has identified some of the issues that any Government would have to consider in preparing a correction plan or any budgetary plan.  However, it should be noted that we are talking about a plan and not the actual detailed legislative budgetary proposals that will have to be brought before the Oireachtas in the normal manner.  A key purpose of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill and the stability treaty is to correct budget imbalances where we have deviated from converging towards our medium-term budgetary objectives or the adjustment pact towards it or failed to comply with the debt rule.  Section 6 of the Bill was drafted on the basis of the common principles as required by the treaty.<\/p> <p>While the Government, and I am sure future Governments, will always seek to promote economic growth, job creation and the delivery of high quality public services, it is highly likely the deployment of a correction plan could result in unpalatable choices which may not be in compliance with the suggested amendments, at least in the short term.  Sustainable public finances are a key element of sustainable economic growth.  Giving priority to economic growth, job creation and delivery could prove to be an obstacle or a limitation on a Government's choice of actions which are needed to ensure sustainable public finances.  In working to ensure the sustainability of public finances any Government would have to have all possible levers of policy available to it.  Additionally, each budget day the Government publishes illustrative cases showing the effect of major changes in revenue and certain social welfare payments on various categories of married, civil partners and single income earners.<\/p><p> With regard to requiring Oireachtas approval before adopting the plan, I note amendments which could result in the contravention of our treaty obligations cannot be accepted.  The stability treaty requires the triggering of a correction mechanism if there is a significant deviation from the medium-term objective or the adjustment path towards it.  Furthermore, non-compliance with budgetary rules would contravene the stability treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800006#E01200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350567600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I have tabled a number of amendments and I will try to deal with them.  The Minister mentioned an adjustment plan could most likely result in unpalatable choices.  This would not be in line with the amendment I tabled, which is that the plan should prioritise economic growth, job creation and high-quality public services.  Perhaps we should prioritise the plan we are in at present.  As recently as this week the troika stated while the plan may be reaching its targets it is failing, and there is no doubt it is failing people and the domestic economy.  I do not know why there is stubbornness about changing the plan.  I am afraid the Minister and the Government are focused on adjustments without recognising that if we were to prioritise economic growth or job creation - with more than the spin coming from the Government - and lift people out of unemployment, take them off social welfare and put them into the workforce so they would pay tax and increase their spending power in their local communities it would result in closing the deficit.  It is very disappointing but not surprising that the issues of job creation, public services and economic growth do not get a mention in the plan.<\/p><p>  With regard to requiring approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas, I dispute and challenge the Minister's assumption this would not be in compliance with the treaty that was passed.  As the Minister rightly said, the treaty has placed an onus on us to trigger a correction mechanism to be decided by the Parliament.  The treaty does not specify in what shape this correction mechanism would take, although it includes the four points laid down in the correction mechanism.  It does not rule out the Houses of the Oireachtas being required to approve this correction mechanism.  I challenge the Minister's assumption that the treaty subverts democracy and that a future Government or Minister for Finance can lay before the D&aacute;il a troika programme committing the country to huge austerity through unpalatable decisions taken by a Government without seeking the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a major retrograde step.  I recall the four-year plan introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il was forced to a vote in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister and his party called for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the troika programme itself was put before the Houses.  This would keep in line with what has happened so far.  I challenge the Minister's assumption that this would not be in line with the treaty.<\/p><p>  The Government is running scared of poverty impact analysis.  One can see very clearly the adjustments made so far have hit hard on a section of society which is impoverished, and it is not only the stereotypical idea one has of people who are poor.  There is now a huge squeeze on the middle.  We are all aware of the \"Liveline\" programme and the piece on the news about an individual who stole food to feed his children.  Very few Irish people have not at one stage in their lives sang \"The Fields of Athenry\" about a man who stole Trevelyan's corn so his children could see the morning.  To think an individual is doing the same thing in 2012 as somebody did two centuries previously is appalling.  Perhaps if poverty and equality impact assessments were done on the budget positions put forward by the Government we would not force people down this path.<\/p><p>  I challenge some of the statements made by the Minister but I understand he will not accept these amendments.  I will not press them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800007#F00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1350567600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>The Deputy's comments are interesting but they are well outside the scope and scheme of the legislation and outside the treaty.  His claims about social and economic assessments are subjective and I do not blame him for this.  My reading of the Sinn F&eacute;in economic paper suggests to me that it risks putting another 100,000 people out of work rather than creating jobs but Deputy Doherty will claim the contrary.  The point I am making illustrates the difficulty of putting a subjective economic plan into a legislative framework.  As it is outside the scope of the treaty I do not think even if we could agree on the terms it could be done.<\/p><p>  I refer the Deputy to Article 3.1(e) of the treaty, which states, \"The mechanism shall include the obligation of the Contracting Party concerned to implement measures to correct the deviations over a defined period of time.\"  This is the objective as stated in the treaty.  It is not an exercise in economic planning for good or ill; it is an exercise in correcting fiscal imbalances.  This is the obligation under the treaty being reflected in the legislation.  What the Deputy suggests goes well beyond the scope of this and introduces a range of considerations which might make it impossible for the Government of the day to take corrective action when the deviation occurs.  I will give a simple example.  Last February, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had an early retirement scheme across the public service and significant numbers of people retired and the public service was made much smaller.  This runs contrary to any employment targets that Deputy Doherty would introduce because of the serious reduction in numbers.  However, it reduced the payroll bill of the public service and was a measure to correct fiscal imbalances.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of Deputy Doherty's argument, in the terms of what we are doing it is not possible to include it here.  This is why I will reject the amendments.<\/p><p>  This not only a fiscal correction, but a programme designed by the European authorities and the IMF.<\/p> <p>When we get out of the programme, it will be important that we have an economic and social development plan to carry us forward for several years.  It is within this context that we can have a debate on the social and economic objectives the Deputy seeks to import by way of amendment.  Although I disagree with many of the Deputy's remarks, my principal objection is that including the amendments would do violence to the section and the purpose of the Bill.  There are other opportunities to develop economic and social programming in the Houses of the Oireachtas in order that it would incorporate Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800007#F00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350568200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I wish to make two brief points.  As a number of amendments are grouped, I will focus on two and ask the Minister how they cause violence to the article.  First, my amendment on equality and anti-poverty impact assessments reads: &quot;All revenue and expenditure measures contained in the plan must be subject to equality and anti-poverty impact assessments the details of which will be published as appendices to the plan.&quot;  The Minister's view of this is that, if an impact assessment's result was negative in terms of poverty or equality, namely, something would create more inequality or lead to more people being in poverty, he would be constrained with carrying on with the adjustment plan.  The amendment does not state that.  Rather, it requires that an assessment be done.  If the assessment proves that a measure will lead to greater inequality, so be it.  It will not stop the Government from meeting the four rules, (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>d<\/i>).  Nothing in the treaty states that the Government cannot have an equality assessment of the plan.  Indeed, given Europe's long-standing work on equality, it would be bizarre if it told the Government that the latter could not have an equality impact assessment on a number of rules.  Further equality and poverty proofing could be included in specific budget measures, but it is important to have an overall equality and anti-poverty impact assessment of the general plan to which we will all bow and from which everything will flow.<\/p><p>  Second, my amendment No. 9 reads: &quot;The plan shall only be adopted following approval of the Oireachtas.&quot;  Nothing in the treaty's subsection to which the Minister referred denies the Oireachtas the right to vote on the plan.  Is he afraid that some of his backbenchers would reject the plan?  A Government will present a plan to the Houses on how to get back into line within two months of a warning from the Commission.  Usually, if not always, a Government has a majority and should be able to carry the plan through.  The requirement for approval by the Houses is to ensure the plan will at least be thoroughly discussed and that the Government and the Opposition will have a chance to tease out its merits.  The idea that the plan would be rejected would require Government Deputies or Senators to jump ship.  This is a question of the fundamentals of democracy.<\/p><p>  I am sure that the promissory note issue has taken up much of the Minister's time.  He knows there was no discussion in the Houses when that note was agreed, nor was there a discussion when the note's value was increased.  Perhaps if there had been, we would not be in this position.  My amendment requires approval by the Houses following a debate and a vote.  Despite the Minister's comments, nothing in the treaty prevents us from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800008#G00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1350568200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>There is a fundamental misunderstanding on the Deputy's side about what we are actually doing.  This is not a train at the station to which we can keep adding carriages, that is, loading all economic and social policy onto it.  There are several other opportunities to do that.  This Bill is concerned with the corrections required by deviations from fiscal objectives.  The methodology of correction is simple, in that it will either need to be done through the Estimates by reducing expenditure across certain Votes or by increasing taxes.  As the Deputy well knows, the Parliament has a full debate on the Estimates and the budget and sees several votes.  There is no question of the Parliament not endorsing the correction process.  It must do so.  These are the methods by which the deviations are corrected.  Loading section 6 with a range of economic and social objectives weakens it when what the Deputy hopes to do can be achieved elsewhere in the work of the Houses.<\/p><p>  The Deputy brings witnesses to bear on his debate.  Pete St. John wrote \"The Fields of Athenry\", but it is not an historic ballad.  It was only written in the 1970s.  It is fiction.  There was no such person.

Amendment No. 12 is quite straightforward, asking that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would explicitly take account of the pension liability we are facing as a country.  It seems that we are sitting on a pension time bomb and we know this from recent reports, including the KPMG review of the social insurance fund, which states that the State is sitting on a potential shortfall of up to &euro;324 billion with regard to State pensions over the next 50 years or so.  We know from the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the latest estimate provides that at the end of 2009, a total of &euro;116 billion had accrued in respect of occupational pensions payable to public servants.  It is the elephant in the room and there is not enough debate in the Parliament or committee about the pensions liability faced by this country.  The fiscal council should specifically take that into account when completing its reports.<\/p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 13, debt sustainability should be at the heart of what the fiscal council is about.  In the report from last month it made some serious warnings that Ireland's debt sustainability is very fragile, indicating that there was a 40% chance that Ireland's debt to GDP ratio will not stabilise by 2015.  I am proposing an amendment whereby the council would provide an assessment of the sustainability of the debt position of the State, taking into account the taxable base of the State and the ratio of deficit to GDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800010#J00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1350569100,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Doherty and McGrath.  The fiscal council has been established to address gaps in fiscal policy analysis and to provide assessments and recommendations relating to fiscal policy.  Imposing a very wide mandate on the fiscal council would require much larger resources in terms of both staff and budgetary allocations.  Expanding the mandate would be likely to impede the council's fulfilment of its core functions, including those specified in the treaty.  Furthermore, some of the suggested functions are the job of the Government, and it is important to note that a number of bodies are supported by the State, such as the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council, whose reports consider all aspects of policy development, including social impacts.<\/p><p>  Additionally, we are not willing to assign other functions not outlined in this Bill to the fiscal council.  We wish to ensure the fiscal council has the resources it needs to complete its core functions and expanding the functions would stretch the resources of the fiscal council to the point where its focus and attention would be taken away from its primary role, and we do not want that to happen.<\/p><p>  Amendments adding requirements that are already covered by the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, and which are published in the annual stability programme update, are not necessary.  Article 3 of section 2 of the 1997 surveillance and co-ordination regulation requires the State to take into account the future pension liabilities of the State, and this information is contained in the annual stability programme update.  The fiscal council is required to provide an assessment of the official forecast, including an assessment of the stability programme update.  There is no doubt that Deputy McGrath is aware that with this section, the fiscal council is specifically directed to the contents of the stability programme update.  One of the elements is to consider the consequences of an aging population, and one of the primary consequences would be pension provision.

One concern expressed to the Department by the fiscal council during the preparation of the legislation was the possibility of a Minister allocating additional functions without additional resources.  This concern was echoed by the troika.  I took it on board by ensuring that the functions of the fiscal council, as stated in the Bill, do not provide for additional functions to be given to the council.  The allocation of additional functions will require amending legislation, which will ensure an opportunity to discuss appropriately matching resources.  The same point applies to this amendment.<\/p><p>  On the question of abuse, most Oireachtas committees have a government majority, and a malign Government could abuse this amendment by directing its members on a committee to vote in a particular way.

It would be better practice if the Government were required to give a formal response to assessments brought forward by the fiscal advisory council.  I got the sense from the council when its representatives appeared before the committee that it feels very unloved.  Its reports so far have been more or less dismissed out of hand.

It provides that the Minister would be obliged to respond whether the Government agreed or disagreed with the assessment made under subsection (3).  My amendment, No. 16, goes further than that.  This is a weakness in the Bill and, although the formula of words could be re-examined on Report Stage, it is important that an amendment such as this is included.  Under the legislation the fiscal advisory council has two primary roles.  One is to deal with the rules that stem from the treaty, which are in subsection (3) relating to exceptional circumstances, the failure referred to in section 6(1) and compliance with the budgetary rule.  Subsection (3) is basically what comes from the treaty.  Subsection (4) outlines its other role, which to provide an assessment of the fiscal forecast in respect of the budget and stability programme, the fiscal stance year by year and whether it is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary stability, including the references to the provisions in the Stability and Growth Pact.  That is crucial.<\/p><p>  Hopefully, section 3 will not arise.  I hope we will not be in a situation where there are issues relating to compliance with the budgetary rule and that we will have growth and are able to deal with this.  The fiscal council's reports so far have been dealing with the budgetary issue and the stability programme.  When I raised this on Second Stage the Minister mentioned that a response to the fiscal advisory council reports is given in the stability programme update that was released in February.  He is correct.  I looked at the stability programme update, and chapter 3.6 is on the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The bulk of the chapter outlines what the fiscal advisory council has told us.  That is not a response; it summarises some of its findings.  Then there are two small paragraphs which detail the Department's response.  The response is printed in red ink.<\/p><p>  The document prepared by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council - its second report - was 64 pages long.  It was hugely detailed and contained a great deal of information.  We all do not agree with the recommendations, but we all gave them a fair hearing and asked questions of the council's members when they appeared before the committee.  There were 64 pages of detailed analysis and recommendations but the Department responded with 185 words.  It is not right that this is the type of attitude is shown to the fiscal advisory council.  I know the Minister and his officials hold the council in huge esteem, but this is something we must get right.  When Professor John McHale appeared before the committee recently I asked him about the reporting of the council and his view of the Government's response.  He said:<blockquote>Deputy Pearse Doherty inquired as to why we changed the advice we were giving since our first report.  In the context of how the Government formally responded to our advice, the stability programme update contained a short response.  We would perhaps like a more lengthy response.  It is very important that the Government does not feel that it needs to respond immediately to what we say - sometimes such responses can come a little too quickly - but that it should take the advice on board and then provided a more considered reaction in an appropriate way.<\/blockquote>An appropriate reaction in a considered way is not 185 words in the stability programme update in response to 64 pages of analysis and recommendations from the advisory council.<\/p><p>  The amendment places the onus on the Government to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas its reasons for not accepting the council's advice, not just regarding what stems from the treaty but also the advice it gives on the budgetary and stability programme, official forecasts and whether it is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, including references to the Stability and Growth Pact.  This is important.  As I said, the amendment could be tweaked because perhaps two months could be too restrictive - obviously the Minister does not wish to show his hand prior to a budget - but it is important that the requirement for a formal response is set down in legislation, and more than what is contained in the stability programme update.<\/p><p>  The second issue relates to instances in which the advice of the fiscal advisory council is not heeded by the Department.  As we have already outlined, what is contained in the Bill is that it would only apply under section 3.  When it is not heeded it should be laid before the Houses and there should be a debate or statements on it.  If we are establishing a fiscal advisory council on a statutory footing to give us independent advice - I am not saying we should take that advice all the time and just implement it - the advice merits statements in the D&aacute;il, at least, particularly if it is on section 3, which deals with non-compliance with the rules of the treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800011#K00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1350569700,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendments.  The common principles adopted by the European Commission require governments to comply or explain why they are not complying with the assessments set out in subsection (3).  Accepting the proposed amendments would result in a requirement for the Government to respond to all assessments and reports produced by the council.  The Government does respond to the assessments of the council.  Specifically, I have responded to its reports in the stability programme updates and the medium-term fiscal statements.  Placing this requirement on a legislative basis would be very difficult.<\/p><p>  The assessments arising from the council's general functions under subsection (4) can be wide-ranging and contain a great deal of analysis and a large number of recommendations.  Would the Government have to respond to every line of the recommendations and analysis or just a few of the main items?  In any event, I and the Government answer to the Oireachtas and the mechanisms available there can be used to elicit further responses to council reports.<\/p> <p>The reference to subsection (3) is a reference to the core functions of the fiscal council under the treaty and the assessments in question.  The fiscal council determines whether if exceptional circumstance exist or have ceased to exist, and also examines the Government's compliance with section 6 regarding the correction mechanism.  The specifics of assessments arise from the provisions of the treaty and are precise requirements.  In addition, requests for debates are a matter for the Oireachtas.  It is not appropriate to place in legislation a requirement for debates.  For these reasons, I do not intend to accept these amendments.<\/p><p> The real response to the recommendations of the fiscal council is not the words used in a particular report but the policy action the Government is prepared to take arising from the recommendations.  The policy actions are usually identifiable at budget time when one sees whether the provisions of the recommendations of the fiscal council are being implemented by the Government.  That will continue to be the real test of whether the Government takes on board the recommendations of the fiscal council.<\/p><p> Neither of the Deputies is tardy in asking parliamentary questions and, if at any stage, they feel there is not an adequate response to a recommendation from the fiscal council, they should table a question for priority.  They should use their usual investigative powers to get the maximum information from the relevant Minister, whether the Minister for Finance or otherwise.<\/p><p> On the question of D&aacute;il debates, the Government is never reluctant to have a debate on a particular issue.  If there needs to be a debate on the recommendations of the fiscal council, it can be processed in the normal way through the Whips.  In the same way as we will have an economic debate next week, if the Deputies think there is inattention to the recommendations of a fiscal council report, there is no difficult having a debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012101800011#K00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350570300,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We have come from a decade where advice went unheard, unnoticed or basically dismissed, in particular by the previous Government.

Having regard to our preliminary discussion with Senator Martin McAleese, we can use this as an opportunity to offer a range of perspectives.  We are delighted the members of the delegation are here today.  Ms Deborah Watters has been a restorative justice practitioner for more than 20 years.  We are very interested in the programmes she worked on in the United States in 1997 and the learning she brought back from those to her work in Northern Ireland.  Her work is very much engaged in a Northern Ireland context but we will also examine her experience in terms of gangland activities in our own cities, as Senator McAleese  pointed out at the  beginning of the meeting.  Ms Deborah Watters is assistant director of Northern Ireland Alternatives, a community-based restorative justice programme operating at a grassroots level in north-west Belfast, east Belfast, south Belfast and Bangor, which works closely with young people involved in crime, anti-social behaviour and gang violence, and she is also an independent member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  She is very welcome.<\/p><p>  Mr. Harry Maguire became involved in Community Restorative Justice Ireland in 1998 following his release from prison.  Community Restorative Justice Ireland is a government-accredited community-based conflict resolution group, of which Mr. Maguire is currently acting director.  Since 2008 he has focused on engagement with the criminal justice system and on building a strong relationship with the PSNI.  He is a member of the Restorative Justice Forum Northern Ireland and of the new policing and community safety partnerships.  The two witnesses are very welcome and we look forward to hearing their presentations.  I understand Mr. Harry Maguire will be the lead speaker and following his presentation I will open the discussion to the floor for observations and questions.<\/p><p>  Before I invite the members of the delegation to make their presentations, I would like to advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments or evidence in regard to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I have been involved with Northern Ireland Alternatives for the past 16 years and helped to set it up.  As the members will have heard, I worked in the United States for five years before that.  I managed a restorative justice programme in an area south of Chicago and dealt with many gang issues and drug issues and was able to bring some of that learning back to my local environment.  Like Mr. Harry Maguire, I am a parent, I am not a grandparent - not yet - and I live and work in north Belfast.  Therefore, I also am a key stakeholder in this.  I do this work not only because I believe in it but because I want to be part of transformation in the Northern Ireland context, namely, part of transforming society into one where we can have equality, true values - old fashioned values - and build new human ways of addressing conflict within our society.  I thank the committee for having us here today and I will hand back to Mr. Harry Maguire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Watters"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350555300,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I will start with how the restorative justice concept arose.  As with all conflict situations, be it the conflict in the North or the conflict in our personal lives, we are challenged by those.  We are challenged in a way that requires us to form resolutions.  As many members will be aware from having lived through it and been part of the vast changes that have been aspects of the process across the island, we had the big political high wire acts in terms of getting the parties around the table, the peace process, mediation and negotiations.<\/p> <p>There had to be peace-building in some form on the ground.  At that stage there were still very fraught relationships across the political and statutory world.  The issue also arose of informal policing initiatives being delivered by armed groups.  That was our starting point - how we could change what was happening on the ground and make interventions on the issue of punishment violence.  When we started out on that journey, we thought it would be the sole focus of restorative justice practice because we were challenging armed groups and saying what was happening was not good enough and needed to change.  We were supported by the leadership of these armed groups in doing that work.  We were also saying our communities had an experience of policing which, to say the least, had not been positive.  We needed to develop a third way, a new way, a much more dynamic way to make the interventions we needed to make.  It was about peace-building on the ground, but it was practical and focused.  Both projects started in 1998 and up to 2006 we made upwards of 600 interventions.  The figures have been fully evaluated.  It was a huge piece of work in the context of the peace process and what it meant.  We were challenging mindsets, a key part of being involved in conflict resolution.  One of the outcomes was that there was an uptake of our services as we started to do the work which we did not expect or legislate for.  We were quickly inundated with a range of community conflicts which were not particular to the North.  One could pick a city anywhere in Ireland and I could go through a range of community disputes that would be present.  We were inundated with such disputes, ranging from disputes between neighbours to much more serious forms of criminality.<\/p><p> The CRJI group has projects in Belfast, Derry, Newry and Armagh, while Northern Ireland Alternatives has projects across Belfast city - north, east, south and west - and in Bangor, north County Down.  We were initially trained, supported and evaluated by Professor Harry Mika who was based in a university in Michigan.  He was a professor of criminology and has written extensively on the use of the restorative justice measures in a global sense and equally in the context of the position in the North.<\/p><p> Our key areas of work involved working to deal with neighbourhood disputes, many of which can escalate, become nasty and extend to various forms of criminality if they are not dealt with early.  We work with young people in an educative way.  We work within the education system.  We try to reintegrate young people who have slipped through back into the school system.  We try to engage schools, young people and families on how to maintain the relationship and see it through to the end of the school process.  We support victims of crime and anti-social behaviour, a group of people who are very often lost in the bigger scheme of things.  We deliver training which we have developed ourselves.  It is very much focused within the communities in which we work.  It is designed to tackle the issues peculiar to these communities.  By training people in the techniques and approaches of restorative justice we build a capacity and mindset in terms of how we engage and do things.  Community empowerment is at the centre of our approach.  The problems that occur and the issues that arise are not being transported from another planet; they are part of the lives of the people concerned and a part of their value system.  We encourage them to become part of the process in order to resolve issues.<\/p><p> Ours is a government-accredited organisation.  I invite Ms Watters to explain the accreditation process to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350555900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Some members may know the history Mr. Maguire has outlined of the development of community-based restorative justice projects in Northern Ireland, but, initially, issues arose with government.  These issues centred on the fact that we had ex-prisoner and former combatant involvement in the projects, for which we never made any apology.  We considered that to use restorative justice practices to transform communities in Northern Ireland, one needed to have ex-prisoners and former combatants at the centre of the process.  At an early stage the Government placed an embargo on our projects, which meant we were not allowed to receive government funding.  We survived because we received private philanthropic funding from the United States through Atlantic Philanthropies.  That funding kept us alive for many years while we negotiated our way through a journey with the Northern Ireland Office.<\/p><p>  We began the process very much true to our values.  We considered that if we were to be true to restorative justice practices, we needed to work at healing broken relationships at all levels.  That was the case with the government also.  We began on that journey and our work and dialogue with the PSNI.  We also began dialogue with the Youth Justice Agency, the probation service, the Department of Justice and others.  Very soon our practice began to shine through because, as Mr. Maguire said, the number of cases with which we were dealing and the level of interventions were centred on issues the Government could not solve.  It could not solve the problem of punishment attacks or the issue of summary justice in Northern Ireland, but with a cohesive, co-ordinated community response through the projects we were able to make a difference.<\/p><p>  Recommendation No. 168 of the criminal justice review in Northern Ireland was on the development of community-based restorative justice projects.  In 2005 &ndash; Mr. Maguire can correct me on the dates if I am wrong &ndash; both Community Restorative Justice Ireland, CRJI, and Northern Ireland Alternatives, NIA, became government-accredited projects.  That meant we were able to be partners within the criminal justice system.  We were able to receive referrals, not only from the public prosecution service but also from the probation service and the police force, the PSNI.  We were also able to receive government funding.  We have come from being agencies which were outside of the system and subject to an embargo to being part of the formal criminal justice system.  I sit on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, while Mr. Maguire sits on the strategic tier of the Belfast policing and community safety partnership.  We have, therefore, come a long way.  The key to this and the message we want to get across is that it is very important to keep communities at the heart of community safety and community resolution initiatives, as communities need to have a voice.  Our projects put victims, young people and parents at the centre of resolving local issues.  As government-accredited bodies, we are now at the table with all of the other statutory agencies and able to bring that community voice to the centre of how they do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Watters"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350555900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>To clarify the dates, CRJI received accreditation slightly later than NIA because of political relationships and circumstances in the negotiations on policing affecting the Nationalist or republican community.  We gained accreditation a couple of years later in 2007, but it had nothing to do with a lack of will.<\/p><p>  Ms Watters has outlined the need to have the community centrally involved in dealing with the issues that affect communities.<\/p> <p>We engage with our current partners on protocol work, which is to do with accreditation and government protocol, how we deal with reports of crime to my offices, and how that is engaged with by the police and then the Public Prosecution Service, PPS.  At that stage it has the potential to come back into the community based restorative justice schemes as community disposals.  There are further developments in that process.  We are talking to the police and other partners in the criminal justice system about how we can change that and make it a much more accessible system.  We are talking about entering into another pilot scheme with them.  We are also looking at how we can bring these approaches into the Prison Service not only for the prisoners but for everyone in the prison service to create better relationships and develop much more productive ways of working with people with a view to breaking the cycle, particularly around young people.<\/p><p> We have healthy relationships with the Department for Social Development, which is one of our major funders, and that is an ongoing process.  We engage with a set of housing providers from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive through to the private sector.  We have projects with Belfast Trust or social services, as we call them in the North.  They are based around young people, vulnerable families and supporting families with issues.  We are funded and have partnership projects with Belfast City Council.  From a Northern Ireland Alternatives perspective that is around Street by Street and developing that type of youth initiative.<\/p><p> In terms of community restorative justice, CRJ, we deal with Traveller issues of which the council is very supportive.  Also in terms of CRJ we have been working with Louth County Council which is looking at marginalised communities, with a particular focus on people who have come to our country who have not been able to engage with the community or the statutory sector.<\/p><p> We work closely with the probation service in the North.  That is a project which threw up many questions around the Northern Ireland Prison Service such as whether we are reintegrating offenders back into the community.  From a community perspective many of the issues we have to deal with are not the issues that result in people going to prison.  They are a different set of circumstances which need resolution.  We are both members of the Restorative Justice Forum.  We have held an inaugural meeting on an all-island basis to look at the possibility of having an all-island conference to examine the restorative practices taking place throughout this island because they are happening throughout the island.<\/p><p> In terms of the future, we want to work with each other on a cross-community basis.  We want to see a coming together in terms of the restorative principles, values and practice.  We see that coming together as being part of the wider project.<\/p><p> This opportunity to open up a dialogue and engagement with the committee is welcome  In the not-too-distant future I will be doing some training in a school not too far from here in the Liberties.  I spoke at a recent event in the South organised by a community development association. <\/p><p> Developing joint projects both on a cross-community basis but also on an all-island basis is something to which we would be open because the issues facing working class communities, although not solely working class communities, across this island, be it in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Derry or Belfast, are the same.  One of the standard questions we asked when we set out on this journey and went into the sometimes smoky rooms in Belfast - at that stage people could still smoke indoors - to talk with communities and armed groups which were feeling the brunt of crime, criminality and anti-social behaviour, as members are aware from their own experience, was about the causes and drivers of crime.  We got the same answer on the Shankill Road and on the Falls Road.  I got the same answer when I asked that question in Cork.  The answer was unemployment, poverty, social deprivation and generations of young people who went through an education system and came out the other end not being able to read or write.  It was ill-health, a breakdown in family structures and a breakdown of some of the institutions of the State in terms of value systems that drove much of the activity we encountered at the sharp end.  <\/p><p> In a Northern sense the next question we had to ask in those smoky rooms was whether it was possible to shoot poverty, and the answer was \"No\".  A much more normal term to use when we are still asking those questions is whether it is possible to put poverty, unemployment or educational under-achievement in prison, and it is not possible.  As a society that is what we have tried to do.  We need to understand that and examine how we can reverse that and grapple with some of the issues on a strategic level, how we can start to change our society, and how we can change the cultures predominant within this sphere.<\/p><p> One of the aspects that jumped out at me when we started to engage in the education field by delivering these programmes and projects within a school context was that dealing with the school disciplinary system was similar to dealing with the criminal justice system because as a society we look at the rules, the rules that have been broken, who has broken them, and the way we sanction those who have broken the rules.  Those are the three aspects of this issue as we see it.  From a restorative practice point of view we look at what has happened, who has been harmed by what has happened, and how we can repair that harm.  That is a completely different way of looking at the issue and is one which taps into all of these causes and drivers.  As a society, that is what we need to engage with.  I will hand over to Ms Deborah Watters who will close the presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350556500,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Mr. Maguire has outlined some of the work his organisation does but I will discuss some of the benefits of the work we do because that is important.  One of the benefits of the intensive work we do with young people is that it is cost effective.  In the Northern Ireland context - I cannot comment on the situation here but the members will know the figures - it costs approximately &pound;80,000 a year to incarcerate a young person.  To take a young person through our restorative process which examines the hurt and harm they have caused to their victims, their community and themselves and to make things right for the hurt and harm they have caused, a 12 month programme costs approximately &pound;2,500.  If we compare those figures, the recidivism rate for young people coming out of prison is 50% or 60% within the first 12 months.  Our recidivism rates currently are 8% or 9%.  Whether one buys into the principles of restorative justice or not one must buy into the fact that this process works, not only locally or regionally but also internationally.  It is more cost effective and it keeps not only young people but adults out of a criminal justice system which further damages them because in our prisons in Northern Ireland people do not learn to do things differently; they learn more of the same.<\/p><p>  In terms of advantages, it is cost effective, it helps to change behaviour and therefore helps to decrease the number of victims in our communities.  It also helps to build a sense of community and empowers people to solve their own problems.  We have a culture where people are used to things being imposed on them.  They are used to solutions being handed to them and they have no ownership over them.<\/p> <p>This reverses that tendency in that we are saying to ordinary people within communities that they can take power into their own hands and that they can be part of a peace-building project with them at the centre and in respect of which they come up with the solutions.  That is why it is about transforming communities.<\/p><p> On behalf of Mr. Maguire and myself, I thank the members for the time they allowed us to talk about our projects.  I hope we can enter productive dialogue in which we can hear the members' thoughts on these issues and share some more of our thoughts and practices.  I believe that restorative practices, put at the heart not only of our criminal justice system but also our education and health care systems, comprise the way to address real social problems and issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Watters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350557100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their refreshing and positive outlook and new approaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800006#E00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1350557100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I apologise as I must leave to chair the D&aacute;il in approximately ten minutes.<\/p><p>  The delegation is very welcome.

That is now part of the discipline programme in primary schools and, I hope, secondary schools.  There is an effort to achieve what has been outlined in the education system.  If people recognise they owe a debt to somebody as a consequence of their actions and if they assume responsibility therefor, it has a beneficial effect.

It has a residence at Lavey in Cavan which is close to where Deputy Smith and I have offices and work.  It seems to do considerable work by way of intervening before young adults get into trouble.  Do the delegates' work closely with that organisation?  Is there a conflict between the two operations or are they mutually complementary?  How does the relationship work?  I was very impressed by Extern and what it does.  I was brought to its premises because I have a relative who works for it.  That is how I got to know the organisation.  I was very impressed by its work.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael Kitt's comment on policing boards and open discussion was interesting.  He referred to the differences between rural and urban areas.  I will be interested in the answer to his question.  <\/p><p>  This is a very worthwhile exercise.  The approach outlined is correct because if one can internalise what one has done, work through it and offer a means of restoration to the victim, one will not do what one has done again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800006#E00400","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350557100,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their powerful presentation.

I commend Community Restorative Justice Ireland on its outstanding work over the years, and particularly on the great service it provides to communities.  It helps to empower communities, and it helps the victims in addition to dealing with the perpetrators in a manner that is humane and caring.  It offers the latter an opportunity to realise the injustice they have inflicted on their own community.<\/p><p>  In the Twenty-six Counties, we have a policing board system.  I sit on the policing board in my area.  If I have a criticism of it, it is that it is not community-oriented and operates outside the communities.  Garda&iacute; and others make presentations but the system does not deal with what is actually happening within communities.<\/p><p>  Mr. Maguire outlined a number of reasons for the social problems that exist, including unemployment, poverty and family break-ups.  He suggested how they might be dealt with.  He has approached the matter with an understanding of the causes in communities and of the way the system deals with people who step outside the norm within those communities, through punishment and so forth.  Mr. Maguire outlined that the latter approach was not achieving anything because there is no intervention to help young re-offenders in the way the witnesses' intervene in their respective areas.<\/p><p>  The programmes seem to be very urban in orientation.<\/p> <p>I can understand that because this pertains to the accumulation of poverty within communities in working class areas.  Consequently, it is orientated towards urban areas such as those mentioned by Mr. Maguire like Derry, Newry, the greater Belfast area and so forth.  Have the delegates made interventions outside these areas into rural communities and so forth?  Mr. Maguire has mentioned that he has made presentations in the South.  Again, I assume they were in urban, as opposed to rural, areas.  There is no difference because there is poverty in both rural and urban communities.  I note the latter have a tendency to be better organised because there is a cumulative effect and it also helps to deal with the problem in a more community-based way.  What advice do the delegates have for those members who are on policing boards and work within communities?  I represent a constituency in which there is a great deal of social deprivation, as well as the associated consequences of such deprivation.  Most of the kids I know who end up in prison come from poor working class areas and so forth.  While there must be a link with education and so on, it must go further than this.  It also must deal with the underlying causes which Mr. Maguire named and that reverts to poverty and unemployment.  Do the delegates have suggestions as to how members, as political representatives, can continue to try to help to deal with these emerging problems?<\/p><p> I again thank the delegates for their fantastic presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800006#E00600","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350557700,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The final contribution in this section will be made by Deputy Frank Feighan, after which we will hand over to Mr. Maguire and Ms Watters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800007#F00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1350557700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Maguire and Ms Watters who are both welcome.  <\/p><p>  I note this has been a highly eventful week.  Last Friday saw the first meeting of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association in Leinster House, at which MLAs, Deputies and Senators from all sides met here for the first time since the foundation of the State.  Last Monday I attended a dinner in City Hall with the DUP Lord Mayor on one side and a UUP councillor on another, with many others.  This would not have happened were it not for the good work done both politically and by the delegates on the ground.  While we come from different communities in many ways, we must recognise the work being done and how far people have come in recent years.  I wish to highlight one or two issues.  <\/p><p>  The delegates must face huge problems with a lot of young people and communities who want to go back to the past, as in certain communities violence was glamorised and those engaged in it were perceived to be held in high esteem.  Is this still a huge issue and how do the delegates address it?  Second, the joint committee has been highly active in visiting many areas.  In so doing I have noticed the great number of groups such as those of the delegates which are doing excellent work and sprang from a need.  However, is accreditation or streamlining among such groups now required?  Third, funding is always an issue.  For example, I am trying to secure funding for a family resource centre which is doing a huge amount of work in providing counselling.  Effectively, it is taking up the slack from the HSE or the health board.  It is not a question of the latter not having the resources, but it does not respond in the same way.  It is almost impossible to secure a minimal amount of funding for the group in question because the structures are not in place.  This obviously presents a huge challenge.  We need more of it.  I congratulate and thank the delegates for the work that has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800007#F00300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350557700,"counter":453,"content":"<p>There have been many questions with a lot of content.  I will deal with some of them and, again, Ms Watters can give a view, as she always does so well.  <\/p><p>  On feedback from communities, we live in communities and feedback sometimes is given on the street corner or while going to the shop.  It happens as people come into our offices and because we hold community-based meetings.  We structure ourselves in such a way that we have multi-agency meetings which take place in communities and at which we have present all of the relevant statutory stakeholders and residents associations.  We also are open and public about our work.  From a community justice perspective, when the decision was first taken to engage with the police on an official basis - I acknowledge we had engaged on some particular cases beforehand - one decision we took was that a police officer who came to our office in uniform would be more than welcome.  We would not be telling him or her what way and how he or she should dress.  In fact, we were quite happy to see police officers come in uniform because that was a statement within our community to that what we were doing was right.  It was a statement that we would engage and would do so in a public manner.  Again, this was about community consultation and communication.  <\/p><p>  The rural and urban question always comes up.  It is for rural and urban communities to decide in what shape or how such processes are embedded in their own communities.  This is about engagement, training and so on.  In a sense, the areas in which we work are city-based, but this is because it is where much of the crime and other antisocial behaviour occurs.  However, we also work in Newry and south Armagh, as well as in stretches and swathes of north Armagh and into Armagh city and so on.  However, we have a project that operates in the rural end of the constituency.  I note Mr. Conor Murphy, MP, MLA, is present and he probably has experience of that project which is both urban and rural.  While we have been asked by rural communities and other urban communities to develop projects in their communities or to come and help, we lack the resources to do so.  I have made presentations in Galway, Sligo, Kerry, Cork, Limerick and Dublin, to name a few venues in a southern context.  However, Community Restorative Justice Ireland, CRJI, does not have the resources to put in place the people and processes required.  I hope from this type of engagement and dialogue we can start to talk about this.<\/p><p>  Mandatory reporting is an issue and will continue to be so for the next few years until we can get to a situation where, in a Northern sense, there is some discretion in and around the issue of policing.  I refer to how we actually engage with young people who have broken the law, particularly in some low level offences.  The question is whether they need to be included in the system.  While there are political questions associated with this in terms of police accountability, from a restorative prospective, I suggest such discretion is needed and that a debate and discussion in this regard are required.  We are upfront about how we deal with people.  We tell them that if they report crime, that is, if they make us aware of a crime and give us anything we need, we have a mandatory, statutory obligation to report it to the police.  This leads me to a question regarding perceptions.  While it would have been a perception that we were not part of the system, we have turned a corner in that regard.  We are now are very much perceived to be part of the criminal justice family or the statutory world.  Uniquely, however, we have also retained our community status and while this always will be a challenge, we have been able to so do.  In this context, we are designated as community-based restorative justice groups, of which we are proud.  I acknowledge it has been Northern-centric, but that is because the dynamics of the conflict forced people into looking at new ways.  We are open to engaging with people across the island in developing such practices and approaches.<\/p><p>  Legislators are a major factor, a point raised by Deputy Martin Ferris.  We need legislation and need to be able to state, within the society in which we operate, that this is part of the system and can be resourced as part of it.  For instance, we sat through a presentation delivered by a guy called Mr. Brian Steele, the point person for the Scottish Executive which has legislated for restorative justice practices to be piloted within a number of schools in Scotland.  Those involved seek to develop this approach within the Scottish education system.  Although the respective projects are at least five years ahead of the Scottish experience, we will lose this very quickly because we have not been legislated for and this system will not be resourced.  However, both projects have been heavily involved in the education sector.<\/p> <p>We hear the saying \"game changers\".  We think restorative practices being embedded within the education sector from a very early age would be a game changer for society across the island.  It is the way to go and if we can keep that in mind it would be a positive outcome today.<\/p><p> There are always people who want to go back to the past.  I am sure if one walks through Dublin today one will see someone with a Teddy-Boy haircut.  They might even have a pair of dark glasses in their pocket and will be dressed like a Teddy Boy because they liked the 1950s and have stayed there.  That is part of society.  Part of leadership in society is to demonstrate that it is better to be in the present, the here and now, and that we are going to make the future even better.  That responsibility is on all of us.  <\/p><p> Speaking from a republican perspective, I do not see too many young people wanting to go back to the past.  I was at a dissident parade quite recently and it featured people aged 30 something upwards.  It was largely people in their 50s who are not going to take anybody anywhere.<\/p><p> There is definitely a sign of contentment there and I do not think they are really going to go back to the past.  I see young people moving beyond all of this.  I am originally from north Belfast so I am quite regularly over in that end of town, which takes me through the interface areas.  I can see young boys and girls starting to meet again at the interfaces, having the type of normal conversations that one would want ordinary young people to be engaged in.  I have great faith in where our youth will take us if we give them the right context and motivation.  I will allow Ms Watters to make her own comments on these questions.<\/p><p> The allocation of funding is an issue, which is why talking to this committee is so useful.  The committee can make an impact on where that funding goes.  Ms Watters will provide the figures on what it costs to keep a person in prison.  Let us change that.  We talk about moving from a punitive to a restorative paradigm.  In other words, we must change how we look at these things.  Let us start to embrace that change, but we need to do it together.  We will find that it will free up funding, thus allowing us to reallocate funding.  If we start to do what we need to do in the education system, it will create high achievers rather than under-achievers.  It will also diminish the burn-out rate for teachers so they will become less stressed and more productive.  The world will then be our oyster.  They employ these employment practices in the private sector.<\/p><p> When we went into schools first they had codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.  We have encouraged them to develop relationship procedures because if we have strong relationships it is the key to freeing up resources.  Rather than spending time fighting each other, we will spend time collaborating with each other.  I know that is not a very good word in Ireland sometimes, but collaboration is the key.  If we get people working together and building the relationships we need to build, it frees up a lot of the resources we have spoken about.  It will allow us to deliver so much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350558300,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I agree with everything that Mr. Maguire has said.  I will start at the end and work backwards.  As regards Deputy Feighan's question about returning to the past, from a Protestant and working-class loyalist perspective I feel there is a danger of that, especially with young people.  Let me tell the committee a story concerning the very first young person I worked with in 1996 when Northern Ireland Alternatives opened its door to the first referral.  We were talking about his aspirations and dreams and he said: \"Debbie, do you know what I want to be?  I want to be an ex-prisoner.\"  It really took me aback.  I said: \"Albert, son, you know to be an ex-prisoner you have to have done something you maybe didn't want to do, and you have to have been in prison.\"  For him, however, being an ex-political prisoner was about the power, status, sense of identity and comradeship that came with it within communities.<\/p><p>  Working-class Protestant communities have not had the ability or structures to filter young people, or ex-prisoners and combatants, into a political party.  That has not happened in Protestantism.  The working class Protestant parties like the PUP and others were not successful.  Middle Unionist parties like the DUP and UUP do not adequately represent our voice.  Within Protestantism there is a real danger that while people will not want to go back to the past, young people will get caught up in gangs, criminality and other activities that are harmful for them.  We need to work hard to guard against that. <\/p><p>  Protestantism is at a whole different stage to where Nationalist or republican communities are.  I am not saying that is right or wrong, but I am saying it is different.  We need to realise there are differences and we need to address them in different ways.  Restorative practices have a lot to offer in terms of helping young people to build a sense of confidence and skills, in addition to taking them beyond wanting to be involved in criminality and conflict, standing at interfaces throwing stones and bottles, and being in conflict with the police.  We need to move beyond that and give our young people aspirations and dreams.  As leaders, we need to hand that down to them.  As someone who works in working-class Protestant communities, we really need to address that issue.<\/p><p>  As regards streamlining and funding, I will be quite controversial and say that a lot of funding has been handed out in Northern Ireland but not all of it to the right places.  Not all of it has been used wisely.  We need to have safeguards and mechanisms in place to ensure that the limited funding put in is used wisely so that we are getting the best out of that money.  Restorative programmes offer that.  One of the reasons we do so is that it is not all about the money.  Northern Ireland Alternatives currently has 300 volunteers.  Mr. Maguire's organisation probably has the same amount.  People do this work free of charge because they want to transform their communities.  Restorative programmes need to build on that culture of volunteerism and citizenship.  That is how we will move things forward.<\/p><p>  Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, commented on sitting outside the system.  For many years I was proud that we sat outside the system because I felt that was why people came to us.  People used us because we were not part of the state system.  We had to be there for the first ten years of our life cycle.  We are now in a very different place.  I like the way Mr. Maguire has described us.  We are part of the wider criminal justice family but we are still independent and community-based.  Our creative tension is that if we lose our community ethos we will have lost our community.  Therefore, we are encouraging our government and the Assembly, as they give us funding, not to pull us away from our community roots.  If they do so, we will lose young people who offend, victims knocking on our doors, and parties who come to us.  We would become another statutory organisation but we need more grassroots organisations.  Our attention is on how we can take government money yet retain our community ethos. <\/p> <p>We would welcome the committee's thoughts on that because it will be a struggle for us on the way forward.<\/p><p> In terms of us being accredited by government and entering into a protocol with our government, the staff within Northern Ireland Alternatives resisted that move.  We had to provide some leadership and say, \"This is the way to go\".  They resisted that move because they said, \"Debbie, we are going to sell out.  We are going to lose our soul.  We are going to be made like any other statutory agency.\"  We need to keep the following high on the agenda - work with communities, put safeguards in place to ensure that the work is done well and there is quality assurance, but remain part of the community.<\/p><p> The only other matter on which I will comment is terms of early intervention.  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned about Extern and early intervention.  If we have learned anything it is that the earlier we intervene the more we keep out of the criminal justice system and the more we keep out of the prisons.  I was speaking to a police officer from Scotland a few weeks ago in terms of early intervention.  He made a presentation at the policing board.  He told us at the policing board that he was going to speak at a breast-feeding conference in London and when we asked why he was doing that, he replied, \"That is early intervention.\"  It needs to go right back to that stage where people begin to understand that how they treat a child in the womb, at nursery and at primary schools, and those experiences, are what make the difference.  More restorative resources and interventions at that end are what make a real impact on our society.  In answer to Deputy O'Reilly's question, we work with agencies like Extern.  We work with NIACRO, the government sector, statutory sector, voluntary sector and community sector.  Our approach is to bring them all together in a holistic family where we are addressing all of these issues collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Watters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350558900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>The final round of contributors will be led by Mr. Conor Murphy, MP, followed by Senator Martin McAleese.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800009#H00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350558900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I have a local project, the CRJ project in Newry and Armagh, which has worked effectively, in both a rural and urban setting, and has provided excellent results.<\/p><p>  I will be brief because quite a number of areas have been covered.  One aspect that always struck me as remarkable, particularly about CRJ, and that I am sure is the same with Northern Ireland alternatives, is the progression from initial hostility for policing to a reluctant engagement to a sense I get, if not broadly across the PSNI then certainly among key players, of an acknowledgement and acceptance of the benefits of restorative justice processes, not only to the community but to the police service itself.  One gets much more of a sense that people have had their eyes opened and are now embracing involving police personnel in training programmes and the like.  Some within the PSNI now understand it.  I am not sure how widespread that is but I certainly get that sense.<\/p><p>  I wonder about the engagement across the Border in Dundalk's project and other engagements in the South.  Is that something that is on the agenda of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well, that people not simply see this as some project that goes on in the community but as a resource for policing which improves how they engage with the community but takes off their plate many matters that tie up necessary policing resources for other areas?

I wish them well as they try to fulfil the ambition of merging into one organisation for restorative justice practices in Northern Ireland.  With that will come much more kudos in terms of increased leverage and access to funding, etc.  In much the same way as Deputy Feighan mentioned the dinner on Friday night last in Belfast and the most recent gathering here of Members of the Assembly and of both Houses of the Oireachtas, we are seeing events that were inconceivable up until fairly recently, and that is a significant statement.<\/p><p>  What is the role, if any, of the restorative justice concept in encouraging the private sector to invest in hard-to-reach communities or communities most affected by the Troubles and sectarian and paramilitary conflict and activity?  The issues that the private sector would be concerned about are those that are well known to all of us - blackmail, extortion and safety of personnel.

If we reduce demand by providing the alternative, then we will make progress.<\/p><p>  In their case, obviously, there is a different story.

There are joint policing committees which are statutory bodies.  When youngsters look in they see all these people and, suddenly, they feel they are not wanted.  It is not community oriented.  It is a worry in that regard.  If we are to provide alternatives, we must do it with a community-constructed approach.  We must use everything available to us.  One of my big bugbears is that some of the sporting organisations cherry-pick in communities.  They go in and pick out two or three good footballers, camogie players, hurlers, hockey players or whatever, and they leave the rest behind.<\/p> <p>That is a huge problem.

Earlier this week a report was issued on St. Patrick's Institution which outlined many of the problems that arise in the prisons in Ireland, including intimidation, locking up prisoners for 23 hours per day for their own safety, rapes and other awful things.  That is occurring across the board and all of us are aware of young people who went into jail healthy but came out as drug addicts or with AIDS.  The system is not working at present but, if we were asked whether we want more prison spaces, we would say \"Yes\" because there is a demand in the community for them.<\/p><p>  I am glad Deputy Wall mentioned the drugs problem.  This is not a new dynamic of conflict in many areas of Dublin and around the country.  It is a lucky town or village that does not have a problem with drugs but one of the huge problems that has now arisen for communities in Dublin is intimidation and drug related deaths.  Everyone from grandparents to those involved are being intimidated and people are looking for answers.  It is not possible to reason with someone who is drugged out of his or her brain.  I know of cocaine houses in my community.  People are afraid to work or bring their children to school because their houses could be burgled.  Many communities want these individuals to be locked up and put away.  We can tell people that it is not cost effective or that their sons and daughters may end up taking this route but they are constantly looking for alternatives to this conundrum.  Community based restorative justice programmes may be cost effective and tick all the boxes and garda&iacute; admit that the current system is not working but at the end of the day we are being forced down this road.  We are seeing alternatives along the route but the momentum of our journey is carrying us onwards.  None of us want to go down the route of prisons but it satisfies a hunger in many communities and it is a brave politician who will stand up to argue that Johnny should be dealt with through a juvenile liaison initiative rather than be imprisoned.<\/p><p>  I have been involved in campaigns on joy riding.  We tried one initiative called \"cop on\" and another group called \"we have a dream\" was established in Ballyfermot.  The aim was to offer alternatives by helping young people achieve their dreams.  Somebody might only have a dream to watch Manchester United play.  Those kids never thought they would achieve their dreams during their lifetimes.  The community rallied to show it was prepared to meet them halfway if they made an effort.  It is difficult, however, to get the resources and various players into place.  It wears people out if the resources and supports are not made available.  Somebody needs to pull together the various strings and organisations.  That is the big challenge.  Somebody must have a big idea that can work and can be sold to the community.  We have tried different initiatives to deal with the drug problem, such as the Concerned Parents against Drugs campaign.  Many of them did not work but they empowered communities and brought people together.  Negative issues arose in some cases because people approached the problem wrongly or did not work it out properly but at least they tried.  The problem with drugs is that they frighten people back into their homes and break down community spirit.  That makes it very difficult to organise.  The witnesses are lucky in that they are not at that stage but it is coming down the track.  As a society, we need to look for those alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800010#J00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1350559500,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Members will agree that the witnesses are opening people's minds.

Everything described by Deputy Crowe could be transported across the western world.  One could take it from New York to Paris to Berlin to Manchester and to Cork because that is what is happening.  As part of that conundrum, if one was a business person looking at how the criminal justice system has performed in all these areas, one would say \"Let's get rid of the criminal justice system\" because it has not performed at all.  It has not tackled crime or dealt with attitudes and behaviour.  In fact, things have got worse year in and year out.  <\/p><p> A number of years ago we spoke about building a superprison in this end of the country.  I do not know why this is still on the agenda with the financial situation.  They have been building superprisons for years in the US and it is not working.  The prison population has broken through the 2 million mark - this is nearly one third of the population of Ireland.  California is nearly bankrupt and is looking at criminal justice and responses to it because it is not a very cost-effective system.  What we do have is a very vested system - a system of interests and a very strong system that will protect itself rather than the citizens about which Deputy Crowe spoke.  That is a major conundrum. <\/p><p> How do we turn those situations around?  We do so by empowering communities.  Concerned Parents against Drugs was a good project but there were problems associated with it.  It involved probably just one constituency and did not interact with the statutory world.  In the ten years since the beginning of Concerned Parents against Drugs up to the 1990s, the damage was done.  If one visits the Monto district or inner-city Dublin, one sees how a catastrophe has happened in terms of drugs and the legacy it has left behind.  This is why we are so strong on building those types of statutory relationships to try and prevent much of that happening.  <\/p><p> How do we turn those communities around?  We do this by embedding the type of value processes, systems and approaches we are talking about.  However, it is also about law and order agendas and using the criminal justice system to really tackle some of the issues discussed by Deputy Crowe.  Let us go for the jugular and follow the money instead of carrying out a drugs raid in Tallaght or Ballymun and chasing the &euro;10 dealer.  We constantly tell the police in Northern Ireland that they should stop looking for drugs and go looking for the money.  Let us change the role models which young people on these estates are seeing.  Let us turn that around.<\/p><p> Ms Watters spoke about aspirations and dreams so let us start and give these young people in these estates the potential to dream.  One of the greatest orators and public speakers was the civil rights activist Martin Luther King.  He used the term \"I have a dream.\" The reason he did so was because everybody has dreams.  We can all identify with that and like everybody else across the planet, we can revisit our dreams each night, change them and turn them into reality.  He was speaking to the layperson.  We also need to identify that as a key way of communicating in the communities Deputy Crowe is talking about because far too often, we do justice at or on those communities without engaging, empowering or including them.  That all needs to end and we need to turn that around.  If there is a drugs killing in Dublin or Belfast, the first thing the Garda or PSNI will do is make an appeal to the community and then involvement suddenly stops.  We need to change the engagement, culture and society.  <\/p><p> We were talking about this on the way down on the train.  Many of us here would have a very similar upbringing in terms of our value systems, which are fed and driven from the Christian faith, be it Protestant or Catholic -  I suppose there are many more faiths on the island of Ireland today - but all delivering the same value systems.  That is no longer the case in the estates about which Deputy Crowe is speaking.  The value systems are not coming from the church.  They are coming from MTV and Playstation games and many of them are negative values.  We need to re-introduce a value system to society.  We are not saying this has to happen but we are suggesting restorative values are a way of doing that.  It is a platform or vehicle by which one can transport these values to societies so that there is a sense of looking after one's neighbour so that the community does not become one of the closed door.<\/p><p> At some community meetings in Andersonstown, I am told that the dogs in the street know who the drug dealers are.  I reply that, unfortunately, dogs cannot talk so they need to tell me or the police who they are.  There is no point in saying that we have a drug problem if we know it is in No. 3 and that is what we need to start doing.  We need to out drugs lords and drug dealers but, at the same time, deal with the consequences of it.  In north and west Belfast, which has the highest suicide rate in western Europe, people constantly talk to me about the massive drug problem we have.  We have 32 chemists at each end of the constituency so that is 64 chemists in north and west Belfast.  That is a hard drug problem.  Prescription drugs are being pumped out.  That is something we could deal with very quickly.  <\/p><p> The private sector should have a key interest in investing in communities and these approaches.  This is because it would be productive in terms of the citizens we develop.  My brother works in the GAA world and he tells me that he constantly works with young people who are not going to make it on to the senior team but if they are good citizens and individuals in the community, the club has done its job.  The private sector needs to help us create that and play a role in it.<\/p><p> In terms of blackmail, extortion and gang activities, there is definitely a role for the private sector in terms of investment.  We also need to see leadership from people in terms of dealing with these things.  A number of dissident groups in Belfast have become involved in that activity and we are encouraging people to stand up to them.  We advise our children from the age of three, four or five up to their early teens to stand up to bullies and that is what we are talking about here.  We are talking about standing up to the bullies but doing it in a way that is positive for society.  It is not about vigilantism, hanging, shooting and flogging.  It is about changing lives and understanding that it is not a lifestyle choice for young people who get caught up in this world.  It is sometimes the context and environment in which they have grown up.  <\/p><p> In the areas where we operate, we have led on police engagement, to return the point made by Mr. Conor Murphy, MP.  We have been very upfront about it because we know that is a key relationship and a game changer.  One cannot shy away from it.  As someone in our organisation once said \"You can't be half pregnant.\"  One either does or does not do it but we chose to do it and be fully pregnant.  I think there is a child on the way because it has been productive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350560100,"counter":470,"content":"<p>He has really taken the analogy and run with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Watters"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350560100,"counter":471,"content":"<p>It is being productive because the police now engage with us on a two-way basis.  When we first began doing it, it was like talking into the ether.  There is now a two-way relationship which Ms Watters can confirm.  Does it need to happen in the South?  Absolutely.  In the constituency of Mr. Murphy, we did a training project with local volunteers and practitioners.  We also asked for the police and the Garda in Dundalk to supply a number of people.  Unfortunately, the Garda either did not or could not see the value of it but the PSNI supplied a number of people for the project, which took place in Bessbrook.  This was a groundbreaking project, particularly given the history of Mr. Murphy's constituency.  It was very productive for the participants and an eye-opener for some of them.  There are lessons to be learned across the island in terms of how we engage.  Speaking as a former combatant, having combatants involved in this type of work was absolutely crucial.  One was going into communities in which people knew and understood one's history.<\/p> <p>The combatants are able to tell the communities that they have walked the walk and talked and talk, and that people need to change what they are doing.  We cannot point the finger at the criminal justice system and say something is its fault.  Many of the issues being grappled with in our communities were our fault and of our making.  They were being fed and underpinned by a value system that we created and developed.<\/p><p> To change this situation, one needs to be inclusive.  A core value of restorative practice and its principles is inclusiveness.  Once one starts to exclude, one starts down the road to failure.  Involving as many people as possible is key, but the criminal justice system must also be expected to deliver on issues.  For example, I met the police recently concerning the issue of serious crime.  Community Restorative Justice Ireland, CRJI, has been responsible for millions of pounds worth of drugs being found.  We have shared information with the police concerning criminals who are working across the island.  When we asked the PSNI about its island drug strategy, we were told it did not have one.  How can one police drugs in Ireland with an imaginary border?  The criminals are smarter than us, as they do not see borders, Catholic communities, republican communities or Protestant communities.  They see markets, potential and money-making schemes.  We are struggling with the Border, geographical spheres, high-level relationships, etc.  Meanwhile, criminals are building relationships.  A major drugs seizure in the North saw a north Dublin criminal, a north County Down criminal and a guy from west Belfast arrested.  It was a cross-community, cross-Ireland venture.  We need to understand that these people are ahead of us.  Only through this type of dialogue can we get to grips with that fact.  North-South engagement needs to flow.  Projects like ours can achieve that.<\/p><p> In terms of Dundalk, we are working with marginalised communities, for example, the Polish and Nigerian communities, and trying to include them in the wider community sphere and introduce them to the statutory world.  Many of the communities in question have formed pockets and live in bubbles.  We are trying to break down the barriers and build awareness in the settled or host community.  The marginalised communities' pockets are not big worlds.  It is not that they do not want others to enter.  Rather, it is a question of not understanding the place, the cultures or the ways.  Let us get communication flowing and start opening up avenues of dialogue instead of simply seeing people on the other side.  This is the main focus of that element of our work.<\/p><p> The 600 cases related to punishments.  We dealt with 1,700 cases last year.  I am sure that Northern Ireland Alternatives did likewise.  While we focused on the 600, we were also dealing with a raft of other issues.  Some of those cases saw very productive follow-up.  Among others, including Professor Harry Mika, we engaged with statutory agencies on these cases.<\/p><p> The next step in policing with the community must focus on how to get better at what we do, how to maintain engagement and how to resource the community end.  If we do not keep the community at the heart of this work, we will revert to the old <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is a question of taking positives from negatives.  The conflict in the North was negative.  All conflict is negative, but out of it can come the opportunity for change.  It can be transformative.  The conflict helped us do that.  A key element of the Patten report was policing with the community.  This should be at the heart of all of our experiences of the criminal justice system.  It should not do things to people, but with them.  It is a question of being a part of the process and the system.  If we can start to build this concept into our way of thinking, we will create a more holistic way of dealing with matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012101800011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350560700,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Mr. Maguire has answered the questions well, but I will make a few additional comments.  Deputy Crowe has summarised the issue for us, in that we do not want to be on this conveyor belt.  It is not working for us, but we do not know how to get off of it.  We need to analyse the issue further.  I agree, in that many of those who are victims or have been on the receiving end of criminal activity initially want people to be locked away.  However, they also want their own needs to be taken care of, for example, restitution, their voices to be heard, the knowledge that it will not happen again and to feel safe in their houses at night.  Merely locking criminals up will not offer a response to this range of needs.<\/p><p>  With the help of people like us, legislators need to consider how to get off this conveyor belt.  As Mr. Maguire mentioned, the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world and is the world's most violent nation.  Punishment is not equal to change.  Locking people up does not address the root causes to which we referred, namely, social disadvantage, poverty, education, etc.  We need to get beneath the surface and begin to address these issues.  We can do this by involving everyone in the solution.  It would have been disingenuous if restorative justice in Northern Ireland had left prisoners, ex-prisoners and former combatants out of the equation.  For a real solution, everyone must have a voice.  This may include people who we do not like or agree with, but that is fine.  An essential ingredient in our success is having people like Mr. Maguire at the centre of what we do.  We need that voice.  We need to have people who have been on that transformative journey to design the programmes.<\/p><p>  Mr. Murphy asked about the Garda.  It is doing some restorative work.  We have worked with it.  The issue is that this work has been piecemeal.  It is not co-ordinated or strategic enough.  As members may know, there is a community-based restorative justice programme in Tallaght that is doing good work.  We have worked in Ballymun and with the St. Andrew's Resource Centre in the city centre.  However, co-ordination and a strategy are necessary.  The work needs to be underpinned by legislation and Government resources.  Some good piecemeal work is being done across the island, but it needs to have more of a strategic focus.<\/p><p>  Senator D'Arcy asked about the criminal justice system and a protocol for sharing information.  The North has a protocol whereby, if we become aware of criminal activity, we are legally obliged to pass that information on to the police.  As Mr. Maguire mentioned, that can sometimes be a constraint to building relationships with communities.  We need to reach the point of restorative justice programmes having some discretion as regards low-level anti-social behaviour and criminal activity.<\/p><p>  Members may not agree with my analysis of the situation, but we only need to lock up the most serious offenders.  I do not know how matters stand in the South, but 50% of the North's prison population is composed of fine defaulters.<\/p> <p>This is costing us &pound;80,000 per year, which is not the way forward.  We need to revamp our system and the criminal justice system.<\/p><p> Reference was made to partnerships.  Our agencies probably have the most partners involved with them.  People are stating that we are making a difference and that they want to be part of what we are doing.  However, it is difficult to encourage partner agencies to bring resources to the table.  They may wish to come on board but we may, perhaps, not always see the colour of their money.  We need to move beyond the point where people are just partners to the stage where they are equal partners who bring resources with them.<\/p><p> That is all I wish to say.  Mr. Maguire has covered the issues very well.

I thank all members of the committee for their interaction in the preparation of the heads of the Children First Bill and I encourage all of us as committee members to seek a \"Yes\" vote and ensure all eligible citizens cast their vote.

I also repeat the thanks for the work the committee has done and for the response of members of the committee and of Members of the Houses to the discussion on the referendum.  We had a wide range of contributions from Members, not least from members of this committee, and we spent more than 30 hours discussing this in committee, with a lot of detail and some very nuanced contributions from a range of Deputies and Senators.  Clearly, important points were made about the Constitution.  The change for children is not just about the Constitution but also about our legislation and how we deliver services and resources.<\/p><p>  All of that was made clear in the discussions we had on the referendum.  It was not an adversarial debate.  There was a rare moment of political consensus on the wording.  As a consequence, we did not get a lot of coverage of the contributions despite this being a referendum on which people will be asked for their vote on 10 November.  I agree it is vital that information reaches people, and one of the ways that is done is through coverage of these Houses, and it was unfortunate such a wide-ranging debate did not get the sort of coverage we would like to have seen given that it was a rare moment of political agreement.<\/p><p>  Since then, however, coverage has increased on the issue.  It is critical the public understands what the referendum is about.  If they do not understand, there is ambivalence and confusion.  I thank all members of this committee, the political parties and the Independents for their efforts to ensure the information is made available to everyone.  The Referendum Commission has published its document and members should have a copy of it.  That will go to every home in the country.  There is also a dedicated website, <i>childrensreferendum.ie<\/i>, and my Department and the Government will be delivering a document to every house in the country as well.  Information is available from a wide variety of sources and I hope that deals with the information deficit at present.<\/p><p>  At its heart, the referendum proposes to place a dedicated article, Article 42A, in the Constitution which has children as its central focus.  This is not about giving more power to the State.  It is about putting children at the centre and focusing on them and their rights, ensuring we listen to them when they speak, and that the institutions that deal with them, particularly the courts, make a greater effort to listen to the voices of our young people, hear their experience and consider their best interests.  To present this referendum as one that will grant more power to the State is not correct.  It is about putting children at the centre while having greater clarity about child protection in our Constitution.  It is about focusing on the children's issues that have been ignored for so long.<\/p><p>  Yesterday we saw once again evidence in the report into St. Patrick's Institution of the failure to look at the best interests of the child.  If anything, that report supports what we are doing, that there should be a greater focus on young people and services for them.  As the Ombudsman for Children said, she was not listened to when she made her points on young people.  She was reflecting the views of young people, so again this is an endorsement of the need for constitutional change, if anything.  It is not an endorsement of not holding a referendum, as some claim.  It speaks to the need for such a referendum because our commitment in the referendum and our obligation is to protect children from abuse.  It puts a greater onus on the State to protect children.<\/p><p>  Currently, the State's intervention is to arise only in exceptional cases where parents fail in their duty towards their children.  This, however, is more child-centred than what went before because the focus is clearly on the impact of the parental failure on the safety and welfare of the child and ensures the intervention is proportionate, as provided by law.  We want to ensure there is support for families at an early stage.  It also treats all children equally when it comes to adoption.  Clearly, further adoption legislation will also be necessary.<\/p><p>  The new amendment recognises children in their own right and, for the first time, will put into the Constitution an explicit statement on the rights of individual children while giving constitutional standing to the best interests and views of the child in child care and family law proceedings.  We have this in legislation already but this will give it constitutional standing, which gives it greater strength.  I urge everyone to engage with the referendum and examine the issues for themselves and look at all the information available.  A great deal of care and consideration has gone into choosing the balanced wording that aims to respect the rights and interests of all parties involved - the family, parents, children and the State.<\/p><p>  The referendum serves as a backdrop to the wider programme of change for children being pursued by the Government.  These reforms focus on improving capability to promote the safety and welfare of children and to ensure child protection services can respond appropriately to all child protection concerns.  We have 30,000 referrals to the child and family services in this country every year and we have 1,500 confirmed cases of child physical and sexual abuse every year.  These are real children where real abuse is taking place and who must be protected.  The referendum puts a clear focus on that.<\/p><p>  The proposed amendment gives the voting public a rare opportunity to consider how we all view children in society and how we reflect that view in the Constitution.  It is not only a question for now but also for future generations.  It merits the fullest attention and consideration of the voting public.<\/p><p>  I support the Chairman's comments on St. Patrick's Institution and welcome his suggestion that the chairman of Oberstown be invited to the committee.  He has appeared before but this is a new appointment where he is carrying out a programme of change in order that we have the best possible facilities when we detain young people there.<\/p> <p>It was suggested the director general of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donlon, should be called before the committee to discuss the appalling report presented by the Inspector of Prisons who inspected St. Patrick's Institution.  The Minister for Justice and Equality dealt immediately with the issues raised in the report.  It is absolutely shocking to read it and hear details of how young people were being treated in St. Patrick's Institution.  As the Minister said, that culture has now ceased.  He has taken a range of initiatives to deal with the issues outlined in the report and announced his plans to close St. Patrick's Institution by 2014.  It is absolutely unacceptable that the Inspector of Prisons should have to report on a culture in St. Patrick's Institution that results in the human rights of some prisoners, children and young adults, being either ignored or violated.  His report identifies significant concerns about the welfare of detained children such as the prohibition on family visits as a disciplinary measure.  In fact, he states he has seen things happening in St. Patrick's Institution that he has not seen in any other prison or centre.  It is damning evidence about the regime in place.  It is extraordinary that it was allowed to continue for so long.<\/p><p> Before I saw any report, I went to the Government and received support to take young adults aged 16 years out of St. Patrick's Institution.  All those aged 16 years were moved from it by 1 May as a result of the Government's decision.  The Government also made a decision to provide funding for the centre in Oberstown in order that we could move 17 year olds from St Patrick's Institution to Oberstown.  This involves a new build, for which I have permission and on which work is under way, as there were no objections to the planning application.  It is my intention to move 17 year olds from St Patrick's Institution as soon as we have other facilities available for them.  That still leaves 18 to 21 year olds in St. Patrick's Institution.  As I said, the Minister has stated it is his intention to close St. Patrick's Institution.  In the meantime I will examine whether we can begin to move some of the more vulnerable 17 year olds from St. Patrick's Institution to Oberstown.  We are involved in some changes to the staffing arrangements that might make this possible and I hope they will be concluded satisfactorily and that we will be in a position to deal with some of the 17 year olds.  As of yesterday, there were 27 young people aged 17 years in St. Patrick's Institution.<\/p><p> When the Ombudsman for Children approached me earlier this year to extend her remit to St. Patrick's Institution, I immediately agreed and wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality who then agreed to extend her remit to St. Patrick's Institution.  That request had been refused for quite a number of years.  I was very happy to support her request to extend her remit in order that she would have the opportunity to go into St. Patrick's Institution in her official capacity.  When she visited it previously, it was in an unofficial capacity and she met the young people there informally.<\/p><p> I will comment on some of the other issues on which we have been working.  Members will be aware that<b><\/b>we concluded an administrative agreement on intercountry adoptions with Vietnam which was witnessed by the Minister for Justice of Vietnam during his visit.  The agreement was signed on 24 September between representatives of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Vietnamese central authority.  It is the first international administrative agreement for intercountry adoptions entered into by the  Adoption Authority of Ireland and Vietnam since the two countries ratified the Hague Convention on intercountry adoptions.  That signing will open the way for the resumption of adoptions between Ireland and Vietnam.  Obviously, there is some administrative work still to be done, but I am confident that adoptions will open shortly between Ireland and Vietnam.<\/p><p> The necessary legislation for the child and family support agency is being prepared by my Department as a priority to ensure we can establish the new agency by January 2013, when it is my intention that the agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families.  That is at the heart of our reform programme.  We need to do significant work to ensure we have a safe transition of staff from the HSE to the new agency.  There are a number of governance issues to be resolved, not least that the child and family support agency will require a strong legal identity, given the number of legal cases that come before the HSE.  We are examining the range of governance issues involved, but I will ensure there is much stronger accountability directly to the Minister than we have seen before.  We must ensure we have new innovative arrangements for governance issues between the child and family support agency and the Department.  The new agency will assume responsibility for the child and family services provided by the HSE and the family support agency.  It will have a workforce in excess of 4,000 and be headed by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, as the chief executive designate who will be supported by a senior management team, the recruitment of which is at an advanced stage.  I will not go into detail on the preparations to be made, but they have been informed by the report of the task force on the child and family support agency which I set up and which reported to me earlier this year.  The priority will be to legislate for the transfer of child welfare and protection services as set out in the programme for Government from January next and devise arrangements for other services for consideration.  We will have a short, medium and longer term plan in terms of the services which can come under the new Child and Family Support Agency.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the work the committee did on the Children First national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. <b><\/b>I have had an examination of the report carried out by the Department.  The Department is examining how many of the identified priorities can be translated into legislation.  I hope to have the required new heads of the Bill in the coming weeks and we can then proceed to process the legislation.  A wide range of submissions were made to the committee as part of the finalisation of the heads of the children Bill.  While recent reviews by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church and the HSE show, for example, that progress has been made in the Catholic Church, it is essential that there are legislative obligations backed up by sanctions applying to all organisations involved with children, including but not confined to faith based organisations.  Last week the HSE published its audit of the child safeguarding arrangements in 24 Catholic dioceses.  A separate audit of safeguarding practices in 150 congregations and religious orders is continuing.  There are two audits continuing.  It is very important that the audit of the congregations is completed as speedily as possible.  <\/p><p> There are other issues, but perhaps members might wish to ask questions at this stage.  We published the survey, How We See It: Report of a Survey on Young People's Body Image, which tells us a great deal about young people and how they are doing.  There are a range of issues on which we are working.  At this point it might be best to leave it to the committee to raise issues of concern to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800003#B00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350549600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her report.  I have a few brief observations to make and wish to raise a number of questions with her.<\/p><p>  The forthcoming referendum is generating little traction.  I am concerned about the lack of media attention in terms of having an informed debate in the wider community.  We fully support the referendum and have done so all along.  We have arranged a number of public meetings in the constituency, as well as neighbouring constituencies, but while people are coming, the crowds are not.  Does the Minister have plans to ensure we will have an informed debate?  I am aware that information booklets will be sent by post to households, but that will not generate the level of debate required.<\/p> <p>While we may disagree with the \"No\" side, I suppose it is welcome to see someone coming out to make that case.  If nothing else, it will ensure the media gives this matter the attention it deserves while complying with the 50-50 rule.<\/p><p> I have highlighted the issue of resources every time I have spoken on the forthcoming referendum.  While I welcome the wording that will be used to enshrine children's rights in our Constitution, I will continue to make the point that this amendment will not be enough if it is not accompanied by adequate resources.  The referendum alone is not a panacea.  It is critically important that we provide adequate resources for child welfare and protection.  If we do not do so, we will not have a robust system.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to the Minister's reply to written questions I tabled recently.  I do not question her commitment.  In the times we are in, however, and as we approach next month's referendum, I would like money to be ring-fenced.  Resources are going to be crucial in the implementation of the referendum.<\/p><p> The horrific report on St. Patrick's Institution makes for very sad reading.  I compliment the Minister for extending the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to the institution.  She was right to do so.  The Government rapporteur on child protection called for this in his last report.  It is to be welcomed.  I commend the author of the report.  Much of what it unearthed would never have been unearthed without the dogged and determined efforts of the author of the report, who called to the institution at unorthodox hours.  He must be complimented.  In light of the severity of the report, will the Minister support his call to bring forward the May 2014 date?<\/p><p> I welcome the signing of an agreement on intercountry adoptions.  The Minister promised to introduce legislation on information and tracing.  Ireland is one of the few European countries that does not have such legislation.  Where is this important legislation on the Minister's priority listing?<\/p><p> I welcome the establishment of the child and family support agency.  I am glad to see it is progressing.  Can the Minister give a commitment that the agency will start with a blank canvas?  It would be a retrograde step if it were to start with a deficit it had carried over.<\/p><p> Child minders are exempt from the provisions of the Children First legislation.  Has the Minister thought further about that?<\/p><p> I would like to speak about the HSE church audit.  I welcome the improvements that have been made.  They were long overdue.  However, some dioceses have been identified as not giving the critically important issue of child protection the sense of urgency it deserves.  Can the Minister outline what her officials are doing to ensure those dioceses meet the standards that are required?<\/p><p> I would like to refer to the survey of how young people feel about their bodies.  Bullying and mental health issues are of great importance for young people.  The cross-party group on mental health organised an informative seminar in the AV room yesterday.  Frankly, I was disappointed that Members showed such a lack of interest in it.  I know all Members have busy schedules, but the small turnout was disappointing in light of the importance of the topic.  We need to examine this matter further, perhaps by inviting some of those who contributed to yesterday's seminar to a future meeting of this committee.<\/p><p> How frequently does D&aacute;il na n-&Oacute;g meet?  I will conclude on this matter, which I have raised in a written question.  I thank the Chairman for his leniency.  The Constitutional Convention will consider the possibility of allowing 17 year olds to vote.  We are being asked to vote \"Yes\" in the children's referendum to give children a voice.  Despite that, there will be no representative of young people on the Constitutional Convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800004#C00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350550200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>That is not a matter for this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1350550200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I am mentioning it because the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is in attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800005#D00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1350550200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that representatives of D&aacute;il na n-&Oacute;g will come before the committee on 22 November next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800005#D00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1350550200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>It is an important issue.

I will make a few comments on the children's referendum.  There can be no complacency.  I am concerned that there might be a degree of complacency across the political spectrum because there is such strong agreement across all parties and elected voices in these Houses.  We have a collective responsibility to advise and inform the electorate of the importance of turning out to vote \"Yes\" on 10 November.  I urge members of all parties and independent voices to use the intervening time to play a proactive part in encouraging people to support the proposed constitutional amendment.  The non-sitting week will give us an important opportunity to urge people to vote \"Yes\" and we should employ it to the best effect in our constituencies.  Those with national responsibilities should play national roles.<\/p><p>  It is important for us to acknowledge that legitimate concerns are being expressed.  The failure of the State with regard to the protection, care and welfare of children is not just historic.  The report on St. Patrick's Institution that was published this week shows that it is a current phenomenon.  We need to sit up and face our responsibilities in this regard.  This committee has agreed that the institution is unacceptable.  Provision needs to be made for access to Oberstown to accommodate that cohort of young people, who should not have been in an institution associated with Mountjoy Prison at any time over its years of use.<\/p><p>  As the Minister knows from the debate on the legislation that has facilitated next month's referendum, my view is that the proposed wording is deficient in so far as it addresses a limited number of situations where the child's interests may be at stake.  I wish it encompassed a range of additional areas where the child's best interests should also be paramount.  I want to make it absolutely clear that the wording being presented to us is not deficient in what it seeks to address.  That is very important.  Those of us who argued for it to go further view what is proposed as a strong and important platform on which to build.  I know that view is not unique to me or my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  I have no doubt that the Minister hopes to be able to build on it in the future.  I acknowledge that would be the disposition of all voices concerned with the rights and welfare of children.  The comments I have made should serve to underscore the fact that I have no hesitation in commending to people the proposal for a \"Yes\" vote in the referendum on 10 November.  Along with my party colleagues, I will play a full part in aiding that objective.<\/p> <p>I have a couple of brief questions on the Minister's responses to the three questions I posed in advance of today's quarterly meeting.  Regarding the national children's and young people's policy framework for the years 2013 to 2017, the Minister indicated the new policy framework will be shaped by the principles underpinning the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  She also noted that the convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards governments must meet in providing health care, education and legal and social services to children.  What status does the framework have given that the rights to which it refers are not legally enforceable?  What will be its impact?  What has been the experience in terms of the impact on the lives of children of the first children's strategy published in 2000?  Will the Minister incorporate in future legislative provision children's rights that build on what will, I hope, be the successful passage of the referendum on children?<\/p><p> On children in high support residential places in special care units, the Minister's response does not provide all of the information sought.  Is this information available?  I would like to ascertain the current occupancy rates and average periods of residence in such units.  What follow-on supports are available to children once they reach 18 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800005#D00600","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350550800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials.  I will ask a number of supplementary questions before briefly discussing the forthcoming referendum.  I asked a question on extending the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  The report on St. Patrick's Institution is timely.  I welcome the statement from the Minister that she is looking favourably at the Ombudsman for Children's request to extend the remit of her office to cover the National Council for Special Education to ensure an appropriate system is in place for dealing with complaints by parents related to special needs assistance.  I encourage the Minister's work in this area.<\/p><p>  On the Ryan report implementation plan and the child death review group implementation plan, while I welcome the Minister's response, the joint committee also has a role in monitoring and tracking progress in this regard.  The committee must be a part of the agenda for change and provision made for it to have a role in this matter.  I was disappointed we were not recognised in having a role.  I will pursue this matter again at a later date. <\/p><p>  The reason I asked the Minister a question on safe care for trafficked children into Ireland was that confusion surrounds this issue.  I thank her for clarification on whether inspections are undertaken of private foster care agencies.  However, on receiving the Minister's reply, I spoke to researchers who stand over their position that the Health Information and Quality Authority informed them that there is some ambiguity on this issue.  I hope the Minister's response will clarify this ambiguity and clear up the confusion on this matter of concern.<\/p><p>  On child protection standards for children in disability services and direct provision, the Health Information and Quality Authority yesterday launched draft national standards for care centres for children and adults with disabilities.  Standards cover all children and we should retain the option of having specific standards for certain categories of children.  I am concerned that independent inspections are still not carried out on services for children with disabilities.  Once implemented, the new HIQA standards will address the issue of children in disability services.  When I have asked in the Seanad and joint committee which standards cover children in direct provision, I have been moved from person to person.  In his most recent reply, the Minister for Justice and Equality asked me to raise the matter with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I refer to the national child protection standards.  I am confused because the information I have received relates to children in the care of the State or cared for by the State and I have been informed that children in direct provision are not in the care of the State and are not being cared for by the State.  The State provides their accommodation, living arrangements and everything else.  We are being caught up in legal language.  The children in question are not covered and direct provision services are not being inspected by any child protection services.  If we do not act on this issue now, in 20 years we will be horrified and shocked to receive a report into current practices in direct provision centres.  I will continue to pursue this issue.<\/p><p>  I do not propose to repeat the contribution I made in the Seanad on the referendum on children.  While I would have preferred the wording of the proposed amendment to have gone further, I share Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's view that most of the relevant issues can be addressed in legislation.  Members will pursue these matters.<\/p><p>  I have been unequivocal in my support for the referendum.  Voter mobilisation will be a major issue.  To go back to the sixth amendment to the Constitution, the vote in favour of the Adoption Act was 99% on a turnout of 28.61%.  The referendum was held on the same day as another referendum on the Seanad.  I worry that children will be seen and not heard in the referendum campaign.  While posters have been put up, we are not seeing or hearing much about the referendum in the media.  I have given a number of briefings and attended public meetings as part of the campaign in recent weeks and it is clear there is an appetite to be informed not only about children's rights but also the wording.  We need to inform members of the public about the wording.<\/p><p>  The Minister is correct that questions are being raised about the lack of trust in the State.  This is an issue we must address collectively.  I agree that the issue of vaccinations continues to be raised at public meetings.  However, the latest issue to be raised is a belief that the referendum is about child benefit.  While I am tempted not to seek to disabuse people of that idea because I would want them to vote in favour of child benefit, I will not do so on the basis that our role is to inform people about the purpose of the referendum.  The Minister has outlined her reform agenda and we need a strong and significant \"Yes\" vote to send out a signal that her agenda for change is considered important by the public.<\/p><p>  While it is great to have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs at the Cabinet table, a strong turnout is needed and I will do everything possible to achieve that objective.  As I do not have a constituency, I will be pleased to travel to any constituency to inform and brief people if Members so wish.  I am an independent voice.  Some of the public meetings I have attended have had large audiences, which demonstrates an appetite for information on the referendum.  Much more coverage of the issues is required in the media.  I note the Referendum Commission appealed to the media yesterday to provide much more information and I hope they will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800006#E00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1350550800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I concur with Senator van Turnhout that people are seeking information.  As someone who has engaged in door-to-door canvassing on the referendum, I note that people welcome calls to their doors but also want further information.  In addition to public meetings, all of the political parties must become involved in campaigning on the referendum.<\/p><p>  While I accept the issue of children falling between Departments is not on the agenda, I propose to raise the matter briefly.  I have raised previously, including with the Department of Education and Skills, the issue of Life centres.  When young people drop out of the education system, they fall between three or four different Departments, primarily the Departments of Justice and Equality and Education and Skills.  While the issue is not directly linked to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, I seek a co-ordinated response to this issue.  I am involved in a Life centre which has 30 young people who have dropped out of school, many because of drink or drugs.  The total funding the centre receives from the State to look after 30 children is &euro;47,500.  We have been advised that the local vocational education committee will cut the teaching hours provided to us this year.  We now rely on people providing a back-up service on a voluntary basis.  Last year, 18 qualified teachers who could not find employment worked with us on a voluntary basis, providing one-to-one education for the children in question.<\/p><p>  This issue falls between a number of Departments.  The centre provides the only support available to 30 young people.<\/p> <p>While it should come under the Department of Justice and Equality and funding should be available from that Department, that is not happening.  I ask for that matter to be examined.  I appreciate the Minister may not be able to give an answer today but I will write to her.  We have raised the issue with the Department of Education and Skills, but I was disillusioned that it appears to have spent more time trying to find out what amount of money we are getting from other sources rather than trying to find funds within its own Department.  As it is an important issue, I ask the Minister to come back to me on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800006#E00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350551400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>A common theme is the need to ensure an informed debate on the referendum.  There are dozens of public meetings taking place in each of the constituencies which political parties attend, and in some cases constituencies have come together to hold these meetings.  The campaign for children has had the campaign bus going around the country.  Many politicians have met those involved, have gone on local radio and have contributed articles to local newspapers.  I commend local radio which is covering the referendum.  I have done many local radio interviews and I am aware that colleagues have also done so.  There is an openness to a discussion on the referendum.  I support what Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Troy have said that everyone has a responsibility across the political divide.  We have all supported the referendum and we have to go out and do the work to ensure the people are fully informed.<\/p><p>  The Referendum Commission has a budget of &euro;1.9 million.  Members will have noticed that the commission asked this week that it would have more time from the media.  I cannot underestimate the importance of the role of the media.  People get their information from the media on so many topics but if the media will not cover it in any great detail, there is an even greater onus on all of us at local level to ensure the information gets out and that we, as politicians, do everything possible by canvassing door to door, as Senator Burke and others are doing, and by providing information in places where people gather.  The non-governmental organisation community is doing much work to get the information out.  There will also be the usual information campaign on the media, using advertising to inform the people of the date of the vote and the issues involved.  There will be much more information in the newspapers and in the media in the next three weeks.  That should begin to deal with what has been a deficit in interest in the referendum.<\/p><p>  At public meetings, a large number of issues are raised and people are very interested.  The referendum is getting a strong and positive response from many of the people I meet.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, if there are concerns, let us deal with them.  If there is a concern that it is about too much State power, let us say it is not and that it is about putting the child at the centre.  Let us be careful to impart what it is and is not about.  It is following on from the work of the committee and it is about a range of issues.  It is not about all issues to do with children but about specific issues, especially in family law, and about inserting a general right in the Constitution.  I note that Deputy Catherine Byrne is reading the commission's report.  As the report states in respect of the rights outlined for children, it will be for the courts to decide at a future date what precisely are those rights.  The commission makes that point very clearly.  We have put in an enabling provision that highlights the rights of children, for the first time, in an explicit way.  We give rights to all sorts of people in the Constitution: rights of association, rights of religious freedom and rights to the family, but rights for children have been missing.  That will be provided for if the people support the referendum, and that is the key point.<\/p><p>  We must continue to give information to the people, hold public meetings and get the information out.  The Referendum Commission has a budget of &euro;1.9 million and my Department has a budget of &euro;1 million to ensure the information gets out.  We will use it in every way possible to impart information.  The next three weeks are crucial in getting the information out.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy made a point about resources.  I agree that resources are crucial.  However, I have consistently made the point that it is not simply about resources, it is also about reform.  We must do better with the money that is being spent in this area as in every other area, and we must prioritise.  I assure Members that change is under way under Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  One can see it in the way cases are being dealt with.  It is much clearer now whether a case needs family support or if it is a child protection issue.  As we have reduced the number of managers from 34 to 19, there is more direct accountability from the front line to the managers in the system.  That is critical.  I received an increase in funding last year from 2011, but a severe financial situation is facing every Department and my Department is not immune.  Nevertheless, we have to do the best we can to preserve the front-line services.  There is still considerable funding, more than &euro;700 million, being put into child and family support services and child protection services by the HSE, and there is another couple of hundred million from my Department.  Therefore, approximately, &euro;1 billion is being spent in this area and we must ensure it is spent in the best way possible and that we have agreed priorities between the voluntary sector, which is working in this area, and the statutory sector.  That has been missing in the past. We are keen to have strong reform.<\/p><p>  We are moving to standardised business processes to ensure we record properly everything around the country that comes to the attention of the child and family services.  We have a new national ICT system, which will make a difference, and a strong service plan with key performance indicators being collected much more coherently than heretofore.  I have said repeatedly at the committee that I was not satisfied with the quality of the data I was receiving at national level, but steps are being taken to deal with that issue.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to say that, in November, HIQA will, for the first time, commence inspection of child protection services in Carlow and Kilkenny, under the new standards.  HIQA launched its inspection standards to ensure child protection services reach the desired standards.  Yesterday HIQA announced it will inspect residential settings where there are children with disabilities.  While these inspections have been delayed for far too long, we are moving to a situation where standards are in place for child protection that have to be met throughout the country.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, this is not just about historical issues.  There is a job to be done currently which is part of a new regime.   These are changes that will make a difference.<\/p><p>  I was asked about the monitoring of the dioceses and standards therein.  Effectively, the director of child and family services works with Mr. Ian Elliott, CEO of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland, on the monitoring of the dioceses.  The development of the Children First legislation will be very important because it will mean people will be under an obligation to report.  Also, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 provides that where any person has information that a crime is being committed or a sexual crime has been committed and he or she does not report it, that is a criminal offence.  That strong legislation has been in play from 1 October.<\/p><p>  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g meets once a year.  I have raised with the Taoiseach the point about the involvement of young people in the constitutional convention and we will see how that can be progressed further to ensure liaison with young people.  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g is an effective system which operates at county level.  It meets formally once a year but it does much in between at county level.  The report on body image published this week was part of an initiative from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g.  It is an active organisation which listens to the views of young people.  The research involved young people who played a major role in designing the questionnaire and presenting the findings.  It was a very positive initiative.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about the availability of places for 17 year olds in Oberstown.<\/p> <p>The difficulty is that to move the 17 year olds from St. Patrick's, we must find approximately 30 places.  There will be 30 places available by 2014 in the new building in Oberstown.  In the meantime, I will examine whether it is possible to use some of the places currently available in Oberstown for some of the more vulnerable 17 year olds.  I must examine the situation carefully and ensure we have the supports and security that will be needed.  I will do this as a matter of urgency to see if some of the 17 year olds currently in St. Patrick's can be moved.<\/p><p> A number of governance issues with regard to Oberstown are being examined.  Roster changes will be required to create more space.  I am confident this will be sorted shortly and that it will create more places.  We will need the new building to deal with the number of 17 year olds involved.  I will continue discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and within my Department to see whether we can increase the number of spaces that may be available in Oberstown for 17 year olds.  Despite this, we will have to wait for the new building to have 30 spaces available.  I will discuss with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, whether there are alternative arrangements that could be considered in the meantime.<\/p><p> I think I have covered the points made by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800007#F00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350552000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I asked about the information and tracing Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800008#G00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1350552000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>The information and tracing Bill is at an advanced stage and we are close to heads going to Government.  This is important legislation.  There are some constitutional issues with regard to access to information, but I will go as far as I can in the legislation to ensure people who wish to trace are supported in doing that.  I will also introduce strong legislation to ensure all records are gathered together in one place and to ensure people have proper access to them.  Currently, records are scattered throughout the country, but ensuring they are available centrally will be part of the legislation.  Work is under way to do this.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the point that there was no room for complacency with regard to the children's referendum.  I agree with him.  He also pointed out that everyone has a role in ensuring the information gets out to people and that we deal properly with legitimate concerns.  In the context of State care, it is very important that we get the point across to the public that State care does not now mean residential care for the most part, rather it means foster care.  It means giving a chance of a second experience of family life to a child who comes to the attention of the State because of serious concerns about his or her care.  State care is about foster care for the most part, exclusive of some children who need residential and specialist services.  Therefore, when we talk about State care, we are not talking about the institutions of the past.  St. Patrick's is an obvious example of an area where there was no reform, and this must be dealt with and changed.  That is accepted by the Government and it has taken action to ensure this is done.  State care means giving a child the opportunity of a second home where his or her first home has failed him or her.<\/p><p>  I wish to take up the point made by the Deputy with regard to the policy framework.  It is a policy framework informed by best principles and what is important about it is that it impacts across all Departments and that it is a clear statement on our targets for children.  For the first time ever, I have set up an early years group to examine best practice from birth to four.  We did not have this previously, but it will be included in the new policy framework.  It is important to have a vision of what we want for our young people and that is what the policy is.  It also needs to have a practical implementation plan.   Perhaps I can come back to the Deputy with the outcomes of the previous framework as that is probably the best way to deal with that.  I would be very happy to put together a document on the impact of the first framework.  I am not in position to go through the detail of that here, but quite a number of important initiatives for young people flowed from that first policy framework.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the number of children currently needing special care and high support.  The number in high support currently is ten, the number in special care is 17, and four children are currently awaiting placement.  One of these is very recent and has just been referred while the others are waiting slightly longer.  All children in special care are there as a result of a High Court order.  From time to time, children with more immediate needs move ahead of some of the children on the waiting list, and we had one example of that this week.  A decision had to be made to put a child with very high risk behaviour ahead of one of the children whose need was not as immediate but who is nevertheless high need, given the High Court has said the child should go into special care.<\/p><p>  Children who need this level of intensive support are identified in the High Court.  The case is then put to the national care admission and discharge committee and it examines each case.  If approved by the committee, the child is put on the list and as soon as a place is available, the case is put before the court and it provides for a special care order.  This is how it works currently, but there is always the possibility of an escalation of need.  Of the four children waiting for places, one has been waiting since April, one since September, one since mid-October and one in recent days.  It is clear we need more high support places and we have increased the number of places.  We have started using one of the settings that was investigated previously where it was found improvements needed to be made.  Those improvements have now been made and we are able to supply quite a number of places in that setting.<\/p><p>  This is an area that needs special attention.  It has been ignored in the past and we need to have a clear policy and high standards, something we have not had in the past.  This is evident from the HIQA reports on some of our residential settings.  However, there are improvements and I believe the area is being monitored significantly more at national level.  The director of the child and family support services is paying more attention to it and is devising a national policy for the first time.  A more local approach was taken previously, but that approach was not good or acceptable enough.  The standards in this area were not acceptable.  Now, work is ongoing to improve them.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout raised the question of direct provision and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised a point related to the Ryan report.  I would be very happy for this committee to have a role in regard to implementation of the recommendations of that report.  I chaired a meeting of the Ryan recommendations implementation committee earlier this week.  Significant progress is being made on the recommendations.  Many have been implemented and I would be very happy to come back to the committee to discuss the details.  Satisfactory action is being taken on the recommendations of the Ryan report.<\/p><p>  I believe I have responded to the point made about HIQA.  Direct provision is a concern for me.  I confirmed with the HSE this week that it has a responsibility for children in direct provision if there is any question of those children being at risk and in need of assessment as regards care and protection.  That is quite clear if a report is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800008#G00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1350552000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Is that if a report is made to the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800008#G00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1350552000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>That is right.

It is an area about which I am concerned.  These children were excluded from many of the provisions relating to child care in this country.

The referendum has nothing whatsoever do with vaccinations.  There is a 94% vaccination compliance rate here.  Senator Crown would be more of an expert on this but the figures I saw indicate a very high level of vaccination uptake for Irish children.  There are no plans by the Government to introduce legislation to force vaccinations.  The referendum does not deal with this issue and there is no question about that.  There is no precedent in our courts of interfering in such a micro way in family decisions.  The referendum is about cases where there is risk to the safety and welfare of the child, where it has been prejudicially affected, and the response must be proportionate.  Any interference in relation to vaccinations would not be acceptable or proportionate and would not meet the criteria in the referendum wording.  The referendum is not related in any way to child benefit either.

Last night I participated in a debate on the referendum on radio and it struck me that the main thrust of the argument of the opponents of the referendum was that we should not trust the State.  In that context, does the Minister agree that the key point for us to get across is that the referendum is designed to ensure vulnerable children are brought up in a family situation?  When that issue is raised, it is very important for all of us who favour the passing of this referendum to keep making that point because all those who are opposed to the provision have to do is raise enough doubts in peoples' minds.  We must get across the message that the point of the referendum is to ensure vulnerable children will be brought up in a family situation, even if it is not their natural family situation.<\/p><p>  I have checked out the legal situation regarding the McKenna judgment and, in that context, it is very important both sides of the argument get fair play and are allowed to explain their position clearly.

People want to know if this referendum will make it easier for children to be taken from their parents in exceptional cases, and also when exactly the State can intervene to ensure a child's interests are at the centre of all decisions being taken about his or her welfare.

The information booklet is very good and I understand it will be delivered to every home.  A number of people have asked me why this referendum has taken so long and perhaps the Minister can explain that because I am unable to.  Apparently it is 19 years since Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness first prompted this idea and people have been asking me why it has taken so long to get to this point.  They want to know why people have been allowed to continue to abuse children physically and mentally while the State dithered.  In that context, the State has failed children.  I ask the Minister to respond to that question because I am struggling to answer it on the doorsteps.  I know what I would like to say but I am restricted.<\/p><p>  My main advice to the public when they ask what they can do is to be the eyes and ears of their communities.  I tell them that they know the children in their areas and to watch out for them.  In my own community, there are people who know what others eat for their breakfast.  They must also know when children are not being looked after properly.  I am trying to emphasise to people that child abuse and neglect is everyone's problem.  It is not just an issue for the State, social services, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or teachers but also for every one of us as individuals.  We all know of neglected or abused children in our communities.  We meet them every day.  In my previous life as a community volunteer, I regularly dealt with difficult children in the youth club at my local community centre whose older siblings also had behavioural problems connected with their family problems.  It is sad to say that there are some families who have had difficulties over three generations and who struggle in vain to keep their children out of prison and away from anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>  Perhaps this is not an issue for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but I have grave concerns about the money that is spent on projects in communities.  I want to know where the money is going because in many of those projects, people are dealing with the second and third generations of the same eight to ten families.  There is something radically wrong when the same families are filing through the door of community projects, year after year, generation after generation.<\/p><p>  The referendum information leaflet states that \"the views and wishes of the child should be taken into account, as long as the child is sufficiently mature to make this appropriate\".

We would all like to see this referendum pass but the biggest doubt for members of the public is whether they can have confidence in the child protection services and in the reform that is taking place.  I have asked previously for a more localised breakdown of the figures on the numbers of child protection cases as well as on the numbers of staff and vacancies in social services.  That detail cannot be provided to me as the information is only available on a regional basis.  It is not acceptable, in the context of, for example, the damning report relating to the infamous Roscommon case, that I cannot tell people in Roscommon how many social work staff are employed in the county, how many vacancies exist or how many cases are on the books of Roscommon social services.  Those are basic data that should be available to me, as a public representative, and to the wider community.  This must be addressed.<\/p> <p> One of the recommendations relating to the Roscommon case was that an audit be carried out in County Roscommon regarding cases of serious neglect.  When that audit was completed, more than 18 months ago, the national director said the HSE would publish a redacted version of it.  Since then, the story has changed consistently over time.  First, the audit was to published in a redacted form, then in an executive summary.  We are now being promised a composite of the audits of Roscommon and two other areas.  The last time the Minister came before this committee we were told publication of that report was imminent.  Here we are again.  The report is still imminent.  When will the composite report be published?  What is the delay in publishing it?  Why is the Roscommon audit not being published?  That audit identified the fact that one in four of the neglect cases in County Roscommon were deemed to be at risk, and that was a mere snapshot of 30 cases.  There is continuing concern about the operation of services in County Roscommon but the people who are concerned about the audit have sought its publication without success.       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800009#H00700","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350553200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I wish to record my unambiguous support for the referendum.

It is clear that is what the goal is.  I remind the public that this is already in the Constitution.  It is long established in the Constitution that the State has a role in protecting children.  We have taken that provision, made it clearer and looked at the impact on the child as a prime reason to take a child in and protect that child.  One must look at the impact on the child.  We have reformulated the Article so it focuses, not on the parental failure but on the impact on the child.  We have also built in other aspects of caring for children that are very important, such as looking at their best interests and hearing the views of the child, and I will answer questions as to how that will be done.  We have also added a general provision that has never before been in the Constitution.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely right that the first goal of the referendum is the safety and protection of children who are at risk.  I have already given the numbers of children who are coming before our child and family services.  This is reality.  Children are abused, mostly in their own homes.  It is exceptional and affects a small number.  Our absolute support is for the family and for every child to have the opportunity to be brought up in his or her own family and for that family to be supported wherever that is needed.  <\/p><p>  There are, however, exceptional cases where we have to do what is best for the child, to give that child a second chance.  We are making it easier to give those children a second chance of family life by changing the adoption legislation.  At present, one must, effectively, be abandoned until one is 18 years of age for an adoption to be allowed, that is where it is not voluntary.  Voluntary adoptions go ahead.  A child of married parents cannot be adopted at all.  <\/p><p>  We built in careful safeguards.  This is not about snatching children.  It is not about trying to undermine parents.  The first goal of the State is to support parents.  It is in exceptional cases where the child is not being cared for and is at serious risk that we want to give that child a second opportunity of family life.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right to focus on that.  I take the point he is making about McKenna.  Most of us are happy to debate any place where we are given an opportunity, with whoever.  It is for the media to decide how they work out that balance.  They are beginning to do that and to ensure that there is more coverage.  I notice increasing coverage.  During the campaign on the stability treaty referendum, the coverage built up as the campaign went on.  This is a one-page amendment.  The stability treaty had 20 pages.  It should be possible for us to examine and get the information across about what is intended<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Fitzpatrick's question, the State already has a role in protecting children.  Under the child care legislation it is very clear that the State has a role to intervene and protect children who are at risk.  That continues to be the same.  We are ensuring that the perspective of the child is more central than it has been in the past.  For a very long time, the perspective and experience of the child has not been as centre stage as it should have been when decisions were being taken in court rooms.  One can see that absence in many of the reports that are being presented to me and which have been examined in this committee.<\/p><p>  It is not about giving more power to the State but about a balance between a family's rights and a child's rights and making sure we look to the protection of the child at all times and do not return children to situations that are dangerous.  Many of the children cited in the report of the independent child death review group died at home, and 67 of them died when they were out of State care.  We must be realistic in making decisions about children who are at risk and try to give them the very best chance.  That is why we are putting this referendum forward.<\/p><p>  Early intervention remains the goal, and to get support to families.  That is why the word \"proportionate\" is included in the amendment.  It allows for supervision orders, for family support and for intervention to support families.  The goal is not just to place children in care.  That is the last thing we want to do.  If it is necessary, however, it has to be done.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked why this has taken so long.  The committee could spend a long time examining why it has taken so long.  There was a combination of factors.  People have called for his for a long time.  For decades, we have had information about how children have been treated in Irish institutions and we did not think one of the solutions would be to put a stronger provision for children into the Constitution.  For the last 20 years it has been recommended that we would do this.  There were concerns that if power, authority, equality or rights were given to a member of a family, like a child, it would weaken the family.  People said the same about equality for women.  The truth is that if one empowers members of a family one empowers the family.<\/p><p>  There was a political hesitancy about doing this.  Catherine McGuinness called for this 20 years ago and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children called for it.  Previous Ministers of State, Barry Andrews and Brian Lenihan, and the joint committee chaired by former Deputy O'Rourke spent three years examining whether or not we should do this.  If a committee of the Oireachtas is to mean anything, we should take the recommendations of that committee seriously.  It held 64 meetings and heard a huge number of submissions.  The committee concluded that we should do what we are now putting to the people.  The Government has not delayed in putting the wording forward.  We put an undertaking in the programme for Government and a referendum will be held on Saturday 10 November.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne made a point about giving more accountability to projects in communities.  She is right.  Our reform agenda for the new child and family support agencies must involve working more closely with the bodies we are funding.<\/p> <p>We will need to work more closely with those bodies who will be in receipt of funding and we will need to be clear about the criteria because there will need to be more accountability.  Funding has been given out in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner in the past.  We must align the priorities of voluntary organisations and statutory agencies, not least because we are in a time of such financial difficulties.  <\/p><p> On the question about who decides on the maturity of a child when his or her views are to be taken into account, the courts have begun to take the views of the child into account.  This is already a feature of child law in some areas referred to in the amendment but the amendment will strengthen this feature as it will be a constitutional provision.  Judges are taking the views of children into account.  In some instances the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system is used whereby a social worker or other advocate is appointed to meet the child in order to understand the child's perspective, to spend time with the child and to clarify the issues.<\/p><p> It is acknowledged that any child who can express a view has that view heard but there is no pressure on the child to express a view.  It might not be appropriate in some circumstances such as in custody or access cases where such expression of views may be too traumatic for the child.  A child may not wish to express a view or may be ambivalent in his or her views.  The weight to be attached to the views of a child is a matter for the judge.  The view of the child does not determine the outcome but it is very important that it is heard.  A combination of common-sense in the approach to hearing the child's view along with information from expert witnesses such as psychologists and others and information from the parents, would be critical.  The judge will form a view.  If and when the referendum is passed the courts will have to examine how this provision will be implemented by them.  I think they can learn much from international practice where the views of children are given more recognition.  In my view, an eventual move towards a system of family courts is the way to deal with this issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has spoken about moving to family courts which are less adversarial and where it will be easier for the views of everyone concerned to be heard.  That is the medium to longer term solution for dealing with this issue.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughten will have noted in my reply to his question that quite significant progress has been made in Roscommon.  It is very clear that practice has improved with more management and more services.  There have been many positive outcomes arising from a dreadful situation.  I commend the Deputy on his attention to this issue and the care with which he has pursued it.  I have given the Deputy a number of examples of how there has been a very significant improvement in the care services.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Naughten about the need to have information at regional and local level.  That information is being made more available.  As soon as the new systems are in place, I will be happy to give information about services in a region or local area.  Such information is important, not least because of what other members have said.  It is important, for instance, to know how many children are being abused and neglected in Roscommon, Kildare, Cork and Dundalk.  The community can then begin to take responsibility and be aware of what is happening in their community.  As many of these cases are heard in the family courts, that information is not available.  As I do not have the statistics about local areas that I would like to have, I am unable to provide them to the Deputy.  However, these statistics are being gathered and collated nationally.  The Department has a new ICT system and business model to ensure that kind of information is available.  I expect that in the next few months I will be in a position to give the Deputy more data than has been possible to date.  The Deputy's key point was about the basic data and community responsibility and I can only agree with him that we need to move to a position where more detail is available.  <\/p><p> Deputy Naughten also asked about the audit.  Gordon Jeyes has the audit and I hope we will be in a position to publish it fairly shortly.  It was compiled by an outside consultant and it took that length of time to carry out the audit which is a national representative sample from a number of areas.  We are not in a position to audit every case but I think it will provide useful information.  I do not have a timeline for its publication but I will come back to the Deputy about the timeline.  My intention would be to publish the audit as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800010#J00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The composite audit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800011#K00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800011#K00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>What about the individual audit?

I wish to put this information on the record of the House.  This review highlighted the following: the strengths and challenges and the positive outcomes; well-established multi-disciplinary arrangements and organisational structures which facilitated team work and communications; initial assessments routinely completed; an emphasis on direct work with children and young people; and a commitment to listening to children and ensuring their voices were heard.  The review found that in a majority of the cases, staff and managers displayed a commitment to early assessment of need and provided a range of supports to assist children and families, resulting in improved parenting capacity and better outcomes for children.  The review concluded that the challenges involved are similar throughout Ireland and the UK, including: the need for more authoritative social work; senior managers reviewing and auditing files; national supervision policy implementation; and establishment of thresholds where legal intervention in cases is required.<\/p><p>  It is important for the Deputy to acknowledge that an audit has been carried out.  It has shown that the issues that were highlighted in the inquiry are being addressed in Roscommon.  I have always said that reform of the child protection services will not happen overnight but there have been what I would call fairly major improvements.  The audit will be published and it will include Roscommon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800011#K00900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister could deal with Deputy Healy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800011#K01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Deputy Healy raised the matter of child poverty.  The figures on child poverty are of concern.  The best way out of poverty is through employment and that is the reason the Government is focusing on the creation of more jobs and tackling the economic issues.  If we want to deal with child poverty we have to deal with the economy.  Deputy Healy is correct that we have to ensure that the strongest possible supports are in place to enable those families to return to the workforce.  A job is the road out of poverty and unemployment and is one of the key methods for tackling that issue.  We must ensure that those families most at risk are given the most support.  This will be my intention in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101800011#K01100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1350553800,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.
