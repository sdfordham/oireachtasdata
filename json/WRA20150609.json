Following a tender competition, a contract was awarded in April 2012 to Wilker Auto Conversions in Clara, County Offaly for an initial two 4x4 off-road Iveco ambulances.  This was followed by a further order for four Iveco ambulances in 2013.  The tender competition was carried out in accordance with standard procurement procedures and no procurement issues arose during the course of the competition.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the tasking, purpose and utilisation of the 4x4 Iveco off-road ambulances differs from the normal road ambulance.  Due to the nature of its requirement to be off-road capable, the chassis differs significantly from that of on-road ambulance vehicles.  The Iveco vehicles have a high body necessary for off-road manoeuvrability and as a result, a minimum of four persons are needed to load and unload the stretcher when operating off-road in difficult terrain.  I am advised that this would be standard practice for all military off-road ambulances which are not fitted with mechanical lifting assistance. <\/p>  <p>  An issue arose with the Iveco ambulance when it was used, from time to time, in normal on-road scenarios and with the normal medical crew of two people.  The crew of two people had difficulty lifting the stretcher into the ambulance.  As a result of a follow-on assessment by the Defence Forces Safety Advisor in April 2015 it was affirmed by the military authorities that the minimum lift requirements in an on-road scenario should also be four people as it would be in an off-road scenario.  Standard operating procedures and training is being provided on the safe use of the ambulance in an on-road scenario. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the focus in recent months has been to develop a cost effective solution to permit the ambulance to be used with a normal medical crew of two people.  Work is ongoing on this solution at present. <\/p>  <p>  I am assured by the military authorities that ambulances will be capable of safe operation both on-road and off-road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900071#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900071#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[21292\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900071#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Defence Forces personnel currently deployed on United Nations, European Union and other humanitarian missions; his plans in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>As of 31 May 2015, Ireland is contributing approximately 500 Defence Forces personnel to 13 missions throughout the world.

While I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter, the issues relating to the use of Lariam are well documented.  With regard to the issue in the U.K. Defence Forces to which you refer, the Irish Military Authorities advise me that it is a matter for individual Defence Forces to determine whichever malaria chemoprophylaxis it deems most suitable for use.

Significant precautions are taken by the Medical Corps in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors.  These include the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues.  The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Former Ministers for Defence have had the various concerns surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Lariam must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have the most effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900072#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Investigations","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900072#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[21294\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900072#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he has received the report from former High Court Judge, Mr.Justice Roderick Murphy, which reviewed the deaths of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>In December 2014, I appointed former High Court Judge, Mr. Roderick Murphy to conduct an independent review of the investigations into the death of Private Hugh Doherty and the disappearance of Private Kevin Joyce (Caomh&aacute;n Seoighe) on 27 April 1981 while serving as members of the Irish Battalion with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).<\/p>  <p>  Privates Doherty and Joyce were serving with UNIFIL in 1981 when, on 27 April 1981, an observation post at Dayr Ntar manned by them came under attack.

In many cases the cause of death is known, i.e. the deceased was under the care of a doctor etc.  In these cases the doctor can fill out the Medical Certificate of the Cause of Death<b><\/b>in a relatively straightforward manner as the cause was generally an illness or sickness the deceased suffered.<\/p><p>However in approximately 20% of all cases (5,000 to 6,000 cases annually) the cause of death is not immediately known and the case is referred to a Coroner.  Deaths from sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths must be reported and investigated by the Coroner.  The Coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation into these types of deaths. <\/p><p>The Coroner's investigation may require a post-mortem examination, sometimes followed by an inquest.  The Coroner's inquiry will establish whether death was due to natural or unnatural causes.  If death is due to unnatural causes then an inquest must be held by law.  Approximately 30% of all cases referred to the Coroner undergo a post-mortem examination and\/or and inquest (some 1,500 to 1,800 cases each year).  The death will be registered by means of a Coroner's Certificate when the inquest is concluded (or adjourned in some cases).<\/p><p>A Form 104 is issued to the Garda&iacute; in respect of most inquest cases.

All death records are given an ICD-10 cause of death code and the code is assigned in accordance with the medical evidence of cause of death detailed on the Medical Certificate of the Cause of Death or the Coroner's Certificate.<\/p><p>If there is any doubt about the accuracy of a cause of death code it is flagged for manual intervention by a mortality coder in the CSO who will visually inspect the details.  All inquest cases (which always include any possible suicides) are always flagged and selected for manual intervention for coding by a mortality coder.<\/p><p>There are also a series of edits included in the data capture system that will highlight certain cause of death codes for further checking and correction where necessary.

The recommendations of this report were reviewed and, with the exception of the review of the form 104, were outside the remit of the CSO.

There have been three annual plenary meetings of this Group since 2012 in addition to sectoral bilateral meetings.  The next plenary meeting is due to take place in September. <\/p>  <p>  These meetings provide a platform to continuously assess progress, map out future work programmes, and look ahead to the next Annual British-Irish Summit. <\/p>  <p>  The Prime Minister and I remain committed to meeting at these annual summits to review and oversee progress in the joint work.  Three such annual reviews have taken place to date and the next Summit will take place in London on 18 June.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key outputs from the Joint Statement was the publication in July 2013 of the Joint (British Irish) Economic Study Report which highlights areas for further joint action and has fed into the work programme of the Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries Group.<\/p>  <p>  There have been significant developments on progressing recommendations outlined in the Joint Economic Study. Examples include further collaboration in R&amp;D to maximise access to Horizon 2020 funding; collaboration to unblock barriers to trade in agri-food products, sharing of best practice on CAP implementation and the successful completion of a joint trade mission, including Ministerial representation from Northern Ireland, to the Singapore Air Show and Exhibition in February 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Through the framework of the Secretaries General\/Permanent Secretaries work programme, there have been other significant achievements, including the joint visit to the war graves in Flanders to honour Irish and British soldiers who died in the First World War, and the roll out of common travel area visa arrangements in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Cooperation on EU and wider international issues is a significant feature of the Joint Statement. <\/p>  <p>  Bilateral meetings at Secretary General\/Permanent Secretary level have also taken place between the Irish and Northern Irish Administrations.  The March 2012 Joint Statement also commits the two Governments to continue to work in close co-operation on Northern Ireland issues.  There is very close and ongoing engagement between the relevant administrations in relation to these matters, as evidenced in the recent talks leading to the Stormont House Agreement.  There are ongoing official bilateral links with Northern Ireland in addition to engagement on the areas of North\/South Co-operation that are progressed through the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the work of the British Irish Council will also examine the scope for better synergies between its work and that of the Secretaries General-Permanent Secretaries Group. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900073#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900073#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[22466\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900073#WRC02500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will list, in tabular form, meetings on the proposed European Union-United States of America transatlantic trade and investment partnership, or any of the other names by which these negotiations have been known, by his departmental officials with interested parties; with whom they were held and the date on which they took place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a proposed comprehensive trade and investment agreement currently under negotiation between the European Union and the United States.

The 2015 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    <\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme operated by my Department.  The assessment of means for Jobseeker's Allowance includes the assessment of the earnings and assets of a claimant and their spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant from both insurable and self-employment.  The main provisions relating to the assessment of spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant earnings are contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 and in regulations. <\/p>  <p>  Where a spouse\/partner\/cohabitant has earnings from employment, earnings less PRSI contributions, pension contributions and trade union subscriptions are assessed as means.  However a disregard of &euro;20.00 a day also applies to the spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant for a maximum of 3 days a week (maximum &euro;60.00 a week) and the balance is assessed at 60%.  It is in the nature of means tested schemes that there is no entitlement to a payment once means exceed a given amount and there is no discretion allowed as deciding officers are obliged to follow the legislation when assessing means.  <\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) is a social insurance scheme. It is paid weekly to insured persons who are out of work and is based on contributions paid by the claimant.  It is not subject to a means test.<\/p>  <p>  A person who does not have an entitlement to either jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance may have an entitlement to &lsquo;sign on&rsquo; for jobseeker credits.  Credited contributions can be awarded in circumstances such as unemployment or illness and their purpose is to help protect the social insurance entitlements of insured persons during periods when they may not be in a position to pay contributions.  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment.  <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual does not have entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or credited contributions, they may be eligible for another contingency based payment or in-work support from my Department such as family income supplement (FIS) or the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  SWA is considered the \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900074#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Data","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900074#WRD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[21426\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900074#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of children currently covered by the family income supplement payment.

As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).

This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, this also has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Group was chaired by the Department of Social Protection and included representatives from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement was also undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children.  The Group, which no longer convenes on a formal basis, met on four occasions and held a 'Forum on Working and Retirement' in Croke Park in December 2012.  The purpose of this forum was to obtain views from representative bodies and stakeholders and identify the wide ranging issues linked to working and retirement prior to the development of any possible policy proposals.  Attendees included employer and employee representative groups, older people's representative groups, representatives from the pensions industry, academic commentators and representatives from the legal profession. <\/p>  <p>  The agenda for Group meetings included discussion on the wide range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues and employment and equality law issues.  Whilst the deliberations of the group were not published in a report or single strategy, each participating Department will take the issues that emerged and the views of sectoral interests into account in their development of relevant policy proposals.  In this context and as part of a broader move towards a Total Contributions approach, the Department of Social Protection is considering potential measures to support longer working, e.g., the deferral of the State pension to allow individuals build a more complete social insurance contribution record. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900075#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900075#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[21505\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900075#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the options available in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is currently in receipt of a one-parent family payment, which is due to finish in June 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be assessed by anyone. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  <\/p><p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.<\/p><p>In February 2015, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr. <\/p><p>The Group was established after a review by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. The Group will engage with a variety of stakeholders including those in the public sector, commercial bodies, post office customers and other interested parties. <\/p><p>The Group&rsquo;s membership is drawn from the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU), An Post, the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. <\/p><p>The Terms of Reference for the Group are to:<\/p><p>- examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network;<\/p><p>- identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience;<\/p><p>- engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the above objectives;<\/p><p>- prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable. <\/p><p>The Group&rsquo;s work will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network. The final report of the Group will be available later this year.<\/p><p>An Post has a contract with the Department of Social Protection for cash payment services to welfare customers.  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. <\/p><p>I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option still remains on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.

It established basic EU requirements for occupational pension funds and their supervision.  The EU Commission published its proposal to review the Directive in March 2014.  In making its proposals for revision of the Directive, the EU Commission highlighted an intention to &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - Give greater protection to scheme members and beneficiaries;<\/p>  <p>  - Require IORPS to provide members with clear and relevant information about their pension entitlements;<\/p>  <p>  - Remove obstacles for cross-border provision of services; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that the supervisors have the necessary tools to enable them to effectively supervise IORPS.<\/p>  <p>  Given its responsibility for pensions policy, between March and December 2014, the Department of Social Protection led negotiations on the proposal at EU Council Working Party level. On the 10th December 2014 the Permanent Representatives Committee agreed, on behalf of the Council, a general approach on the revised draft directive.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure the Irish position in these discussions at EU level was as fully informed as possible, rather than conduct public hearings, in the period from July to September 2014, the Department of Social Protection initiated an open &lsquo;IORPS Consultation and Invitation for Submissions&rsquo; regarding the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  As well as being made available to the general public on the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie, the social partners along with consumer and industry representatives were invited to submit comments and observations on Commission proposals.  Whilst submissions received covered a wide range of views, it is reasonable to say that the proposals of most interest and concern to sectoral interests reflected those which Ireland had raised at Working Party level and on which significant progress has been made. Officials from the Department of Social Protection also engaged with the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Education and Social Protection on a number of occasions during the course of IORPS II negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Following accommodation of a range of amendments tabled by Ireland and other Member States, agreement on a General Approach was secured at Council in December 2014. Negotiations have now started within the European Parliament.  Once the Parliament votes for its Report on the Directive, discussions will commence between the Council, Commission and Parliament. This may result in the Directive being further amended or adopted.  The Department of Social Protection will continue to engage with sectoral interests as necessary as the proposal progresses through the legislative process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900077#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900077#WRG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[21989\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900077#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a decision remains with an inspector since March 2015 pertaining to a carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; the reason the inspector in question is unable to reach a decision to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on 12 December 2014.

It includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Unemployment is measured officially by the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey.  A person is unemployed if, in the week before the survey, they were without work and available for work within the next 2 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  <\/p>  <p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  <\/p>  <p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.

In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not keep a record of self-employed persons who are disallowed a jobseeker payment specifically on the basis of failing a means test and there are currently no plans to collate this data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[22051\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce a scheme to address cases (details attached); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>The existence of the State pension (transition) is historical and relates to the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) which, up until the early 1970s, was 70 years of age.  State pension transition (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left State pension (transition) effective for just one year. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement, with the result that average pensions will be paid for longer periods than they are at present.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  In 2013, despite reforms introduced in 2012, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million, and further increases are required year-on-year to keep pace with this demographic change. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical to protect older people from poverty.  Following on from its analysis of its award figures for State pension (transition) in 2011 and 2012 in order to establish the impact of the abolition of State pension (transition), the Department noted that only approximately 12.5 % came from employment, with over 50% coming from another social welfare payment, and the remainder coming from a combination of people already retired, paying credits or self-employed.  This indicates that a significant number of people have left employment well in advance of pension age.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age.  It is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age (and beyond if that is there choice) and in such cases they will have a higher income than they would have from their pension.  However, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measures to support them in such circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66, including &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  (a) Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66; <\/p>  <p>  (b) Where a jobseeker's benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year); and <\/p>  <p>  (c) A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker's allowance purposes in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit within the past year. <\/p>  <p>  Beyond the above measures, there are no plans to introduce a new payment as the demographic reasons for the change remain.  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01550"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[22056\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when the child care supports will be put in place to ensure that those receiving payment under the one-parent family payment can avail of returning to employment or education, as promised by her on 18 April 2012; if she will honour her commitment to those persons, who feel that their family status is discriminated against, in particular those lone parents who are employed part-time or in low paid employment, who are self-employed, and who are in education; how  persons in these categories, who receive family income supplement, can increase their income by increasing their hours to 19, as outlined by her, taking into consideration that lone parents who already work 19 hours will be cut, and given that many lone parents are restricted by low hour contracts, where employers refuse to sign family income supplement forms guaranteeing hours; and where there are increased childcare costs if hours are increased, and there is a loss to those in receipt of rent supplement and housing assistance payments of up to 75% of any increase, which does not cover the additional cost of working; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>With regards to child care, the delivery and expansion of child care services is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs introduced a range of child care measures in Budget 2013 and Budget 2014 to assist lone parents to enter, or to re-join the workforce, namely the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme.  These initiatives build on the existing supports that are provided for, and implemented by, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the child care sector, through which child care is provided to some 25,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates.<\/p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has established an interdepartmental group to carry out an economic and cost-benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility, and affordability of quality child care.  It is intended that the group will finalise its work in the summer of 2015.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that some lone parents are currently working under 19 hours a week and will suffer a loss when their one-parent family payment ends.  My Department is informing customers that their best option is to increase their hours to 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight and claim the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.<\/p><p>  On that basis, it is vitally important that employers nationwide can assist transitioning one-parent family payment customers to increase their hours of work to 19 hours a week in order to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment and, therefore ensuring that they are eligible for the back to work family dividend.  This will result an increase in overall income for these customers when their entitlement to one-parent family payment ends.<\/p><p>  The Labour Market Council has established a sub-Group that is specifically examining the issue of how employers nationwide can assist affected lone parents  increase their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment and, subsequently, for the back to work family dividend. <\/p><p>  With regard to lone parents in education, procedures have been agreed to ensure that all one-parent family payment recipients who are participating in training or education when their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ends will be able to complete their course with income support, subject to normal scheme conditions.  <\/p><p>  For one-parent family payment recipients who are currently in education and, who were scheduled to exit one-parent family payment up to and including 2 July 2015, they can remain on one-parent family payment until their course finishes and then transition to either jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's transitional payment as appropriate. In some cases progression to a new course will be considered as part of this arrangement and so customers should discuss their options with their local Intreo Centre\/Social Welfare Office. <\/p><p>  One-parent family payment recipients who are undertaking courses that are eligible for a SUSI maintenance grant from the Department of Education and Skills can retain this grant until they complete their current course, subject to the normal Department of Education and Skills conditions for the grant.  The maintenance grant will continue to be disregarded for means on one-parent family payment. <\/p><p>  After 2 July 2015 the age for receipt of one-parent family payment will be 7 years and so the majority of customers will transition to the jobseeker's transitional payment when their one-parent family payment ends.  This allows lone parents who are mid-course from 2 July 2015 onwards up to 7 years to complete their course of education.  The jobseeker's transitional payment has always allowed customers to study full-time and receive a SUSI grant.  The maintenance grant will be disregarded when calculating means for these recipients.  <\/p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs. <\/p><p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  <\/p><p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment. Payments under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme will be based on the local authority differential rent means test under which the full-time employment restriction does not apply and therefore will remove a key barrier to persons on social welfare in getting back to work. Housing Assistance Payment is currently in operation in eight local authority areas in which there are approximately over 2,000 Housing Assistance Payment tenancies already in place. There is a target to achieve 8,400 Housing Assistance Payment cases in 2015 as set out in the 'Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform'. <\/p><p>  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and housing authorities to ensure the success of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01750"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[22112\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the various changes in eligibility criteria for persons applying for the State pension (contributory), introduced since budget 2012 to date in 2015; the reason these changes were introduced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>State pensions account for the single largest block of social welfare expenditure.  This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting older people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  With increases in life expectancy, more people are thankfully living to pension age and living longer in retirement, with the result that average pensions will be paid for longer periods than they are at present.  In addition, the number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This combination has obvious and significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision with substantial year-on-year increases being required.  Accordingly, to make the State pension system sustainable in the context of these considerable demographic changes and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of reforms to State pensions have been introduced as follows &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  - With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  - As provided for in Budget 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced from September 2012.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  - As provided for in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months.  This change came into effect in April 2012.<\/p>  <p>  - From December 2013, the number of paid contributions required for Widow's\/Widower's\/Surviving Civil Partner's pension increased from 156 contributions to 260 contributions. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the abolition of State pension (transition) all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  In this context, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a jobseeker's benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the jobseeker's entitlement relating to the second benefit year.  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of jobseekers benefit within the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit Applications","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[22127\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress, to date, in determining an appeal for maternity benefit in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 1<sup>st<\/sup>April 2015, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":379,"content":"<p>Question No. 244 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH02250"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[22142\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900078#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the case of a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon, in relation to that person's application for a carer's allowance; the benefits that the person may be entitled to; her views on the financial difficulty of that person's situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a payment made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to certain elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits.

This indicates that many transitioning lone parents who are working less than 19 hours are increasing their hours of employment in order to become new FIS customers.<\/p>  <p>  Customers who cannot increase their working hours in order to claim the FIS supplement have access to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  This arrangement allows these customers to work part-time without restriction and to simultaneously receive an income support payment, subject to a means test.  If their youngest child is aged 14 years or over, they may still qualify for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA).   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Labour Market Council has established a sub-group that will specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist transitioning OFP customers with increasing their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for FIS and, subsequently, the BTWFD. This sub-group will also look at ways in which employers can assist with the promotion of the BTWFD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900079#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Data","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900079#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[22286\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900079#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the additional child care facilities and subvention that have been put in place for single parents, since the phased changes to the qualification for the one-parent family payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>The delivery and\/or expansion of child care services is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D\/CYA).<\/p><p>My Department in conjunction with the D\/CYA introduced a range of child care measures in Budgets 2013 and 2014 to assist lone parents to enter, or to re-join, the workforce, namely the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme.

The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. <\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<\/p>  <p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved by Revenue through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue co-operates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue's action against the illegal trade has resulted in significant seizures of illicit products, and in convictions of persons involved in the smuggling or sale of illicit products.  In 2014 53.4 million cigarettes and 9,824 kilogrammes of tobacco were seized, and seizures this year, to the end of April, amounted to 22.1 million cigarettes and 634 kilograms of tobacco.  There were 53 summary convictions and 4 convictions on indictment for tobacco smuggling, and 49 summary convictions and 5 convictions on indictment for the selling of illicit tobacco products, in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  A strong legislative framework is in place to combat the illegal tobacco trade.  It is an offence to hold, produce, deliver or deal in untaxed tobacco products and to sell unstamped tobacco products.  A court may impose heavy penalties for these offences and the tobacco products concerned in the offence are liable to forfeiture. On conviction following summary prosecution, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  On conviction following prosecution on indictment, the court may impose a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment.  A higher fine may be imposed where the value of smuggled tobacco products (inclusive of any tax or duty payable on them) is greater than &euro;250,000; in such cases the court may impose a fine of an amount not exceeding three times their value. <\/p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of legislative measures in recent years to assist Revenue in dealing with tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco sales.\u00a0 Measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excisable products.  In the Finance Act 2013, I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production.  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, I strengthened the obligation of a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination.  The measure also allows the Officer or Garda to search any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade and I will support any proposals for additional measures that are shown to be of assistance to Revenue in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900080#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Operations","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900080#WRK02550"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[21234\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900080#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm that minutes of meetings between the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and his Department in August 2012 record that the restructuring of a company's loans (details supplied) were difficult, as the shareholders were not communicating; if he is satisfied that the eventual write-down of the loans was conducted prudentially; if he ever took part in any meeting, conversation, or discussion, verbal, written, or by email, regarding the write-down of the company's loans; and, if so, if he will provide the details of these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the\u00a0minutes of a meeting between IBRC and officials from my Department which took place on 13 August 2012 record\u00a0that the issue of restructuring of the loans associated with the company referred to in the question was \"particularly difficult as IBRC would like to do restructuring but are unable to at present as the shareholders are not communicating\".<\/p>  <p>  The eventual sale of the loans associated with the company referred to in the question was a matter for the Special Liquidators of IBRC.

This OECD study assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland, given the economic challenges faced by a small island.<\/p><p>Last year my Department published the Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy.\u00a0 This contained the results of extensive research which was carried out and commissioned by the Department of Finance in 2014 which sought to quantify the effect of corporation tax policy on the Irish economy.<\/p><p>As part of this project, the Economic and Social Research Institute ('ESRI') were commissioned to carry out a study into the impact that the corporation tax rate has on the decision of firms to invest in Ireland.\u00a0 This independent research found that if the Irish corporation tax rate had been 15% over the period of their sample, then the number of new foreign investments into Ireland would have been 22% lower.<\/p><p>Another paper, titled Literature Review of the Economic impacts of Corporation Tax highlighted research by the OECD and others that point to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage economic growth.<\/p><p>The maintenance of the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax is therefore extremely important for Ireland's economy.\u00a0 Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.\u00a0 A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.\u00a0 Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting FDI to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.<\/p><p>This evidence underpins the Government's continued commitment to the 12.5% rate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These documents (and the others from the project) can be viewed on the Departments website at the following link: .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900081#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900081#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[21349\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900081#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if &euro;495,352.00 relevant contracts tax will be paid by the Revenue Commissioners to a company (details supplied); if the Revenue Commissioners made an application in 2012 for a case stated to the High Court in this matter; if so, the status of such an application; the status of the determination by the Appeals Commissioner on 11 June 2012; and the reason for the delay in concluding this matter.

The outcome of the review was the consolidation and replacement of outdated reliefs by Finance Act 2007.\u00a0 The overall thrust of the measures was to ensure that any intermediary (such as brokers or counter parties) in the chain of a share dealing transaction would continue to be exempt from stamp duty where they do not hold shares as an investment for their own benefit. \u00a0The ultimate purchaser in the chain of a share dealing transaction continued to be liable for stamp duty at the prevailing rate on the consideration given for shares. This rate was 1% when the reliefs were introduced and remains at 1%.

The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. Should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. Where a decision is taken by the trustees of a pension scheme to pass on the impact of the pension fund levy to scheme members as outlined\u00a0 then the impact on the scheme in terms of\u00a0 its solvency position\u00a0would be neutral.<\/p>  <p>  I announced in my Budget 2014 speech that the 0.6% Pension Fund Levy introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011 would be abolished from the 31st of December 2014. I did, however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy will expire at the end of 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax was being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.<\/p>  <p>  The pension fund levy does not apply to public service pension schemes because they are unfunded. However, the pensions of public servants have been subject to a public service pension reduction (PSPR) since 1 January 2011. The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. The PSPR is not a levy but is a pension cut affecting public service pensions.\u00a0 On introduction, the PSPR was estimated as reducing public service pensions by 4% on average, with more severe effects experienced at higher pension levels due to the progressive multi-band structure of the reduction.<\/p>  <p>  A change to the PSPR was made on 1 January 2012, when a 20% reduction rate (previously 12%) was imposed on pension amounts above &euro;100,000. With effect from 1 July 2013, more changes were made to the PSPR to deliver on the Government's commitment to further reducing those public service pensions above &euro;32,500 by between 2% and 5% in certain circumstances, including the pensions above that level of individuals who retired after end- February 2012.<\/p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy tax collected as suggested in the details supplied. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the\u00a0 tax burden on low and middle income earners. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Investment Funds","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[22222\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the composition of the Special Purpose Vehicle as regards private and public investment; if a profit has been delivered over the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>This response takes &quot;the Special Purpose Vehicle&quot; to be referring to\u00a0National Asset Management Agency Investment Limited ('NAMAIL'), which was clarified with the Deputy's office in advance.<\/p><p>The composition of the investment in the Special Purpose Vehicle, National Asset Management Agency Investment Limited ('NAMAIL'), is outlined in Note 1.1 to the NAMA Group Annual Report and Financial Statements as at 31 December 2014.<\/p><p>NAMAIL was incorporated on 27 January 2010.

First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark. The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are designed to be complementary.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that the estimated structural improvement was less than required was explicitly addressed in the Spring Economic Statement. Indeed, based on my Department's estimates at that point in time, compliance with one assessment, the expenditure benchmark, results in not meeting the other assessment, the annual improvement in the structural balance. This somewhat counter intuitive outcome emphasises the material problems posed by some of the technical aspects the rules can generate.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While on the basis of the forecasts contained in the SES, Ireland is not projected to meet the minimum structural adjustment required under the preventive arm of the SGP, in general, Commission assessments of the fiscal stance have taken a pragmatic approach to some of these country specific aberrations and is not expected to be a substantive issue for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the assessment of the SPU by Commission staff found that, assuming execution of the fiscal measures set out in the SPU, the outlook for 2016 is indeed compliant with the structural pillar under the Budgetary Rule.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While I will address other issues comprehensively in my formal response to the Council, I would strongly make the point that when formulating Budget 2016, the Government are acutely aware of the importance of adhering to the fiscal rules and our fiscal policy will reflect this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[22456\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900083#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to alter the qualifying criteria for accession to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, for persons with disabilities; his plans which would provide for additionality to the scheme, to allow for applicants with other conditions to access the scheme; if he has considered how extending the criteria would benefit those whose mobility is greatly challenged by certain conditions not currently included as part of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Specifically, banks are required to demonstrate compliance with the EBA Guidelines on Outsourcing, dated 14 December 2006, which sets out the relevant requirements for banks in respect of any outsourcing arrangements.  The Central Bank reviews a bank's outsourcing proposal against these guidelines and indicates its non-objection or otherwise, it does not formally approve these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of provision 2.10 of the Code is that a regulated entity must ensure that any company operating under an outsourcing arrangement from that regulated firm, acts in accordance with the rules of the Consumer Protection Code.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has previously commented in relation to IT failures specifically and stated that  Ultimate accountability for compliance remains with firms and they must ensure that they maintain oversight of outsourced activities.  Where firms and their management fail to ensure that robust governance arrangements are in place for in-house and outsourced IT systems, they should expect vigorous investigation and follow up by the Central Bank, and for the Central Bank to exercise its powers, including sanctioning powers where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  All financial institutions are\u00a0expected to have adequate systems and controls in place and where issues that impact customers arise they should be addressed and rectified urgently, particularly as customers are increasingly using and becoming dependent on online and mobile banking services.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Central Bank expects firms to communicate clearly and promptly with affected customers when a technical incident occurs, including details of the impacted service, details of alternative access to services and an undertaking that identifiable loss will be remediated.  The Central Bank's expectations have been communicated to banks and are provided for in the Consumer Protection Code as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Section 2.4 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it has and employs effectively the resources, policies and procedures, systems and control checks, including compliance checks, and staff training that are necessary for compliance with this Code.<\/p>  <p>  Section 10.2 also provides that a regulated entity must resolve all errors speedily and no later than six months after the date the error was first discovered, including: <\/p>  <p>  a) correcting any systems failures; <\/p>  <p>  b) ensuring effective controls are implemented to prevent any recurrence of the identified error; <\/p>  <p>  c) effecting a refund (with appropriate interest) to all consumers who have been affected by the error, where possible; and <\/p>  <p>  d) notifying all affected consumers, both current and former, in a timely manner, of any error that has impacted or may impact negatively on the cost of the service, or the value of the product, provided, where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900084#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":697,"content":"<p>Question No. 358 answered with Question No. 340.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":698,"content":"<p>Question No. 359 answered with Question No. 357.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900084#WRO01750"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[22754\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900084#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of commissions of investigation established under the aegis of his Department, in tabular form, since the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 came into effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>Commission of Investigation (Banking Sector).<\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0established\u00a0a Statutory Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector, pursuant to Section 3 of the Commissions of Investigation Act, 2004 on 21st September, 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of that Commission of Investigation are set out in Article 3 of the Commission of Investigation (Banking Sector) Order 2010 (S.I.

The legislation was amended from 1 January 2012 to increase the top rate of PSPR from 12% to 20% on the portion of any public service pension amount in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 also provided for additional Public Service Pension Reduction rates ranging from 2% to 8% to be applied to all annual public service pensions in payment in excess of &euro;32,500 from 1 July 2013.

This will extend the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement to September 2018, while securing an Industrial Relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change at the level of the workplace.  The proposals provide for the gradual unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation, which was put in place in response to the financial crisis.  The Government is satisfied that they are in keeping with the commitment to give priority, in any unwinding of FEMPI measures, to those public servants on lower pay rates.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will extend the existing Public Service Stability Agreement from 2016 to 2018.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">  These proposals, which will partially unwind the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants, are prudent and sustainable in the fiscal space currently available to Government.<\/font><font color=\"#181818\">The estimated overall gross cost of these pay measures (inclusive of the previously committed costs attributable to the Haddington Road Agreement) in each year of the Agreement is &euro;267m in 2016, &euro;290m in 2017, and &euro;287m in 2018 or a cumulative &euro;844m by 2018 of which &euro;278m is attributable to the pre-existing Haddington Road Agreement commitments.  This should be compared to public service pay bill savings of &euro;2.1bn annually, achieved as a direct result of pay reductions under the FEMPI legislation.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">With regard to the net cost of the pay measures, each employee's tax, PRSI and USC treatment is an individual matter while the mix of pay increases and a reduction in the Pension Related Deduction which are provided for within the proposals attract different treatment under the tax code.  However, as a rule of thumb, fiscal deductions to increases in gross pay to employees generally are estimated to amount to about a third of any gross pay award.  When the deductions that are specific to public servants are included, the average is likely to be in the region of 50%.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">Negotiations in relation to the Lansdowne Road Agreement proposals were undertaken between representatives of the Government and the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.  The declared position of the Committee was, in entering those discussions, to enter a single collective agreement with the Government.  A similar parallel process was conducted with the Representative associations of the Garda and Defence Forces.  It is now a matter for Union and Association members representing the public service workforce to consider and ballot on the proposals made.  It is not a matter for me, as Minister, to interfere in this process.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">Subject to agreement by the Unions and Associations on the proposals made, I will bring forward the necessary legislative amendments to enable the terms of the Agreement to be implemented from 1 January 2016.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900084#WRO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[21463\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900084#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the annual cost to the Exchequer of increasing the following public sector gross pay bands by 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10%; &euro;0 to &euro;15,000, &euro;15,001 to &euro;25,000, &euro;25,001 to &euro;35,000.","asker":"1080","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>Based on current estimates the data sought by the Deputy is set out in the table.

To date revaluation has been completed in the four Dublin local authority areas, in Waterford and in Limerick. These revaluations represent 1\/3 of the number of commercial properties but over half of the valuation base.

We have moved from 20th to 16th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook and from 29th to 25th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 13th out of 189 countries, up 3 places since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of the Action Plan for Jobs process which this Government commenced in 2012 was to rebuild our competitiveness and provide a solid foundation for future growth.  The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvement in competitiveness that has taken place in recent years.  Prices and labour costs have grown less in Ireland than in our trading partners.  Combined with the recent depreciation of the euro, this has seen Irish competitiveness - as measured by the real effective exchange rate - recover most of the deterioration recorded during the boom years.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in the Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement, this recovery in competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradable sectors of the economy.  In the longer term productivity performance must be the vehicle through which we must improve our competitiveness and grow the economy.  Relentlessly pursuing cost competitiveness which remains vital to us as a small, export oriented economy is important but we must also sustain our focus on productivity growth across all sectors of the economy.  Structural reform, as championed through the Action Plan for Jobs, is essential to deliver the necessary productivity gains and improvements in competitiveness.  Such reforms are recognised as essential to improving the competitiveness of our exporting sectors, which will be at the heart of delivering on our ambition of having full employment by 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of initiatives underway in the research, development and innovation space that entail significant cooperation with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) researchers are engaged with 145 companies in the UK.  These include British Sky Broadcasting, BT, Smith and Nephew, AstraZeneca, Cambridge Chemicals, Eli Lilly and many more.  This represents about 12% of overall SFI funded researcher collaborations with industry partners.  Eight of the top 10 international partner institutes for collaborations with SFI researchers in 2014 are UK based.  These collaborations amount to just under 9% of all international academic collaborations.  SFI and the Biotechnology and Biological Research Council (BBSRC) plan to launch a formal partnership in late Q3 2015.  The BBSRC, one of seven Research Councils in the UK, is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience with key priorities in the areas of agriculture and food security, industrial biotechnology and bioenergy and bioscience for health.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises the strategic importance of the development of an all-island economy on the basis that, in taking on the global market challenge, we can be more than the sum of our parts and extensive links have been forged with various agencies and bodies in Northern Ireland and with the UK.  Work in this context is focused on liaison with, and participation in, cross border bodies, close cooperation between Invest NI (INI) and Enterprise Ireland and close cooperation with UK agencies.  The inter-agency 2015 work programme between Enterprise Ireland, the UK Trade and Investment Agency and Invest NI includes a project to explore options for collaboration related to our national contact point Horizon 2020 activities, which has the potential to be beneficial to all.  Elsewhere, the all island Innovation Voucher initiative continues and this assists small firms to access innovative solutions available in the higher education sector north and south of the border, with the vouchers of &euro;5,000\/&pound;4,000 giving these companies the financial support to get them on the first rung of the innovation ladder.<\/p>  <p>  Horizon 2020 represents a significant opportunity for North South cooperation.  Increasing successful applications and funding awards from Horizon 2020 is an important objective not just of the Irish Government but also of the Northern Ireland Executive.  The international collaborative nature of Horizon 2020 makes it ideally suited for Ireland and Northern Ireland to work together for mutual benefit.  The importance of North South collaboration is recognised by both Administrations and the alignment of our Horizon 2020 support structures, North and South, means that there is now a strong basis on which to grow this cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  The work of InterTradeIreland, the North South Trade and Business Development Body, has stimulated a move towards a more focused, coherent approach to co-operation that will be mutually beneficial.  This work is paying dividends and the number of North\/South collaborations has been rising steadily.  To ensure that we build on this success and maximise the level of co-operation for the Horizon 2020 programme, a Strategic Action Plan for North South Cooperation in Horizon 2020 was launched in December 2014.  This Strategic Action Plan sets out the rationale for a North\/South target of &euro;175million and actions for co-operation which will support the achievement of both Administrations&rsquo; internal priorities in respect of participation in Horizon 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900086#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900086#WRQ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[21259\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900086#WRQ03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if consideration will be provided to making Drogheda, County Louth, a designated location for an advanced factory unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>At the launch of the Regional Action plan for Jobs in February this year, the Government announced that an additional &euro;150m over 5 years would be made available to IDA Ireland for a capital investment programme to help attract more multinational investment and jobs into each region.<\/p>  <p>  The programme will build on the recent investment by IDA Ireland in facilities in Athlone and Waterford and will include investments over the coming years in construction of advance manufacturing and office facilities in Sligo, Tralee, Castlebar, Galway, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone, Carlow and Waterford.

Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.  <\/p><p>This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP would be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950s.<\/p><p>In the case of the recently concluded negotiations between the EU and Canada, for example, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation could only arise when there is: <\/p><p>-denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings;<\/p><p>-a fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings;<\/p><p>-manifest arbitrariness;<\/p><p>-targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; or<\/p><p>-abusive treatment of investors, such as coercion, duress and harassment. <\/p><p>In addition, in the Canada Agreement, there is provision for a list of arbitrators pre-agreed by the EU and Canada.<\/p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform<\/i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, which builds on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreement with Canada, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.  <\/p><p>These improvements are aimed at fixing the problems with dispute settlement in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.

his views on whether or not this practice is discriminatory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":872,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421, 423 to 425, inclusive, 429 and 438 together. <\/p>  <p>  The provisions covering eligibility inspections under the Basic Payment Scheme and other Direct Aid Schemes are provided for in Title III of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809\/2014 (previously Commission Regulation (EC) N0 1122\/2009).  In accordance with this Regulation, such eligibility inspections can take the form of a ground inspection as part of a Remote Sensing inspection.  A review of the accuracy of the data held in the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is also provided for in the same Regulation.  Articles 28 and 29 of the Regulation provide that, applications under the Direct Payment Schemes should be subjected to both administrative and cross-checks to verify their accuracy and their compliance with the eligibility requirements of the Schemes.  One of the most important cross-checks undertaken is to verify the accuracy of area declared and land usage against the data stored in the LPIS.  In order to protect EU funds paid out under the Direct Payment Schemes, it is expected that the information held is as accurate and up to date as is possible.  The EU Commission can, and do, propose financial correction where the data held is not accurate or up to date.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, farmers in general, who submit applications under the Direct Payment Scheme and various other schemes and who are not satisfied with a decision made by my Department in the processing of these applications can appeal to the Agricultural Appeals Office.  In some instances where the volume of appeals submitted is extremely high, it is necessary to provide for an alternative appeals mechanism to process these in an efficient manner.  This was the case in respect of appeals submitted under the 2013 LPIS Review.  I, therefore, established the Independent LPIS Appeals Committee to deal with such appeals.  In view of the sheer volume of the number of appeals received - over 10,000 - it would not have been possible to process appeals under LPIS Review using the normal process.<\/p>  <p>  This Committee comprises of an independent Chairman and Appeals Officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office.  The Schedule to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 was amended by the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations 2013 (SI No. 10 of 2013) to exclude the Land Parcel Identification System Review 2013 (LPIS Review 2013) cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where persons were dissatisfied with a decision affecting them under the 2013 Review of Eligibility of Land parcels, they were entitled in the first instance, to have the decision reviewed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, where applicants were dissatisfied with the outcome of the review, they were granted the option to seek a review of that decision from the LPIS Appeals Committee.  If they continued to remain dissatisfied following the outcome of the Appeals Committee review, they were then afforded the option to pursue the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Terms of Reference of the Appeals Committee is available on the website of the Agriculture Appeals Office.  Each appeal case is decided on its own individual merits and an individual recommendation is forwarded from the Committee to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that the review and appeal process is as robust as it should be and applicants are given every opportunity to make their case.  If there are any queries arising from the applicant&rsquo;s review and\/or appeal procedure, my Department arranges to carry out an on-site verification check to confirm the information submitted by the applicant. <\/p>  <p>  During a LPIS Review Process, ineligible areas and features are excluded from the LPIS land parcels as declared by applicants.  In many instances, such exclusions will not have any monetary impact as the farmers were declaring lesser areas than the adjusted reference areas.  In other instances, as many applicants declare more land than the number of entitlements held, the adjustment will not lead to the imposition of any deduction or penalty on BPS.  In any event, all applicants, whose parcels were adjusted following a LPIS Review, are written to in relation to the adjustment.  This letter is accompanied by map(s) of the adjusted parcels which details the new as well as existing exclusions.  The letter and maps are issued irrespective of whether the adjustments led to a deduction in payment or not.  In fact, many of the appeals submitted by applicants under the LPIS Review related to cases with no financial deductions or sanctions.  Applicants in receipt of these notifications are entitled to avail of the review and appeal process already outlined.     <\/p>  <p>  A LPIS Review involves the assessment of the latest ortho-imagery available for lands parcels, on the Land Parcel Identification System, which are declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes.  The objective of the assessment is to identify and exclude any ineligible areas or features from the land parcels declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes in order to ensure that the applications are validated correctly.  The assessment is normally undertaken using the latest ortho-imagery available but in some instances it is necessary to carry-out a follow-up verification visit on the ground to confirm the findings of the assessment.  Such verification visits may relate to one or more parcels on a farm.  In general, my Department officials make contact with the applicant by telephone in the case of parcels, which are owned, leased or rented.  In view of the number of farmers that claim on the same commonage parcel, it is not possible to make similar contact in the case of the verification checks on commonage parcels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","counter":873,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":874,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[21302\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to the recent publication of the guidelines on land eligibility, if he will confirm that these guidelines also apply to Article 34(2)(b)(i) of 73\/2009 which was repealed and replaced by Article 34(2)(b)(i) 1307\/2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":875,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the provisions relating to the eligibility of land covered by the Water Framework Directive and Natura 2000 under the Basic Payment Scheme contained in Article 32 (2) (b) (i) of Regulation (EU) No 1307\/2013 were also included in Article 34 (2) (b) (i) of Council Regulation (EC) No 72\/2009 (as amended) in respect of the Single Payment Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":876,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 423 to 425, inclusive, answered with Question No. 421.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Appeals","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR03350"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[21314\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900087#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an appeal regarding a penalty under the large single farm payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2014 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas scheme application on 7 May 2014.

Rather, the principle of equivalence will be the basis for trade.  Essentially this means that, while food production processes need not be identical in the EU and US, these processes must provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production in order for trade to take place.\u00a0 Under the equivalence principle, it is the importing Party that decides whether the conditions for equivalence have been met.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the negotiating directives agreed by the EU for these negotiations preserve &ldquo;the right of the Parties to take measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the basis of the level of protection of health, safety, labour, consumers, the environment and the promotion of cultural diversity..., that they deem appropriate&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of equivalence together with the right of reservation on policy grounds should provide good protection for Irish consumers and will allow the EU to retain its current approach to food standards.  This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production.\u00a0 The EU Commission has made it clear in the negotiations that it will not countenance the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that Ireland has strong offensive interests in these trade negotiations, particularly in the agri-food sector.\u00a0 We are seeking greater market access for dairy products both in terms of tariff reductions and removal of regulatory barriers.  Key exports would be branded packaged butter, powdered products and sports products.  We are also interested in meats &ndash; both beef and pork &ndash; and in opening the US market to Irish lamb.  The expectation in the past was of a limited opportunity or niche market for exports of beef to the US.\u00a0 However, because of the recent higher prices in the US, the US market will become more attractive for other lower value beef cuts.\u00a0 Consumer foods are also a potential area for growth, particularly porridge oats.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, on beef, we have defensive interests as well although our defensive interests are tempered by recent developments in US prices and our gaining of access to the US market for Irish beef.  Nevertheless it is important that any quota granted to the US does not undermine the absorption capacity of the EU.\u00a0 Furthermore any quota agreed with the US would need to be matched with a quid-pro-quo quota for EU beef in the US.\u00a0 Ireland would be well placed to benefit from such a quota, with our first mover advantage on the US market.<\/p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with Minister Bruton and his Department on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900088#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge","counter":921,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900088#WRS02550"},{"type":"question","counter":922,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[21515\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900088#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute; na bearta at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh ag a Roinn chun an pobal a chur ar an eolas faoi na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; i nGaeilge at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute; na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; faoi choimirce na Roinne; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":923,"content":"<p>I ndiaidh taca&iacute;ocht trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; a fh&aacute;il i dTithe an Oireachtais, foils&iacute;odh an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 i Nollaig 2010.

BiaFoodInitiative have met <font color=\"#222222\">Tesco, who are providing equipment and some other support.  <\/font>The Department of Social Protection is supporting staffing of the hub and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has provided advice on carrying out the business in a safe way in compliance with the food regulations, given that such organisations come under the definition of a food business in the general food law.\u00a0 In March BiaFoodInitiative joined Bord Bia&rsquo;s online Origin Green Platform , which provides access to a network of over 400 companies, who could include this as a waste reduction measure in their Origin Green action plans.<\/p><p>FoodCloud connects businesses that have too much food to charities in communities that have too little.  Using the FoodCloud app, or the website, participating businesses can upload details of their surplus food and the time period in which the food can be collected.  This automatically sends a text message to the most appropriate charities in their community.  The first charity to accept the offer collects it directly from the business.  By donating surplus food to various charities, businesses can assist them in reducing their food costs and therefore allow them to redirect funding to programs assisting those who are disadvantaged, creating long tangible and long lasting local benefits.

The BDGP utilises the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.<\/p><p>The BDGP was approved under the agri-environment provisions of the Rural Development Regulations and will contribute to an important reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd. The Programme&rsquo;s six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers. Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration. The commitment timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, facilitating planning and budgeting on their farms for the duration of the Programme. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases a penalty will be applied. However, I am satisfied that the approach reflects a proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment applies only in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is caused by circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as illness or disease. My Department has also confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his\/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds. Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the programme (the maximum payable area), he\/she is required to continue to meet its terms and conditions on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p>While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014. It was not possible to select a future date because a scheme approved under the RDP could not provide an incentive for increasing stock numbers. Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facilitate early payments under the scheme. The provisions do, however, allow the use of 2015 as an alternative base on an exceptional basis for new entrants, applicants impacted by force majeure circumstances in 2014 and for those who would have been excluded from the scheme as a result of a reduction in stock numbers in 2015. Applications to use 2015 as a base will be considered as a case by case basis.<\/p><p>Many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for 4 and 5 star animals. Analysis undertaken by ICBF on the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement that the number of 4 and 5 star females are equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm. Furthermore, 52% are already compliant with the 2018 requirement that 4 and 5 star females are equal to 20% of the reference animals on each farm. All farmers will receive comprehensive training and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy. These requirements will take time to introduce and this is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the programme. <\/p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his\/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &lsquo;reference animals&rsquo;. The number of reference animals will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme. For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype nine cows\/heifers\/calves\/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition. While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. <\/p><p>The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.<\/p><p>Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers. Scheme applicants can contact my Department directly with any specific queries they may have and, in addition, they will also receive additional information specific to their herds in the coming week which will provide a useful overview of the current position of their herds.<\/p><p>Finally, I believe the high level of applications reflects the significant interest in this programme and the benefits it can deliver to our beef sector. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review. Should a need to change aspects of the Programme arise, I will address these issues subject to approval of the EU Commission, in a manner consistent with the objectives of the programme and relevant regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900090#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Eligibility","counter":1034,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900090#WRU03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1035,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[22194\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900090#WRU04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason disadvantaged area based payments\/single farm payments have not issued to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1036,"content":"<p>Payment under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme issued directly to the nominated bank account of the person named on 3 November 2011.

The Operational Programme is broader in nature and identifies investment needs across the seafood sector. The Aquaculture Plan identifies investment needs for aquaculture but also addresses broader challenges facing the aquaculture sector, including regulatory aspects. To ensure consistency between the two separate documents in relation to aquaculture, the two share a common aquaculture SWOT analysis and propose the same financial supports, as all financial supports to aquaculture will be financed through the Operational Programme in any case. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900091#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900091#WRV02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[22358\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900091#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 218 of 6 May 2015, if the business case for financial resources for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute is subject to the approval of his Department's fisheries division, which also has direct responsibility for fisheries development, and if the same is true of staffing matters in these agencies; and if he will acknowledge the clear conflict of interest in this arrangement which undermines the confidence of the public in the actual independence of these agencies.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1077,"content":"<p>As I said in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 218 of 6 May, the financial resources to cover the operating expenses of the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority are made available to those agencies by the Oireachtas through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.

This office provides those services to non-nationals who are resident in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  This service is currently run by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>The Visa section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality also operate from this office to issue re-entry visas to non nationals travelling outside the State who require such a visa to return to the State.<\/p><p>In relation to the visa services provided, the Deputies will be aware. that there was, during December last, an unprecedented level of demand for re-entry visas &ndash; well above volumes of previous years - which led to long queues forming.  Decisive immediate action was taken with significant additional resources re-deployed to the re-entry visa office with the result that by the end of the first week in December all persons who came to the public office were dealt with on the same day.<\/p><p>To avoid a recurrence of such unexpected demand and queues developing, I asked my officials to bring forward their proposals for the introduction of an on-line appointment service for the re-entry visa process.  Design of the system is at an advanced stage and is expected to be in place shortly.  I should reiterate that applications for re-entry visas may be made by post so there is no necessity to attend at the public office and I would urge applicants to make as full use of this service as possible.<\/p><p>Extensive arrangements in place to deal with demand at Burgh Quay office which is one of the busiest public offices in the State with approx 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office.  Specifically, in relation to the GNIB The GNIB public office is one of the busiest in the State and at its peak period from September to mid November, when student registrations are at their highest, it will process up to 500 persons per day.  Special arrangements are put in place in September, October and November to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges.  Periods of time in these months are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), specifically for registration of students. <\/p><p>The GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open 13 hours a day from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, thus ensuring those attending are dealt with on a <i>'first come first served&rsquo;<\/i>'  basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each non national on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation that is required for registration, so that delays are avoided.  Last year the office opened on some Saturdays to deal with the high level of demand in the autumn peak.  In recent weeks the Garda National Immigration Bureau with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has established an alert on the &quot;latest news&quot;  section on the home page of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Website for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an alert is posted on the Garda Website alerting persons to the number of available tickets remaining at Burgh Quay. <\/p><p>Tickets are not issued to non-nationals whose registration relates to their presence in Ireland for study related purposes, until after 9am so as to facilitate those non-nationals whose permission to reside in the State is work related and who attend at the office between 8am and 9am.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau endeavours to provide a 'same day service', for non-nationals who pay the required fee for a 'registration certificate' by way of Debit\/Credit card.  A person paying the said fee by way of 'bank giro' is required to return to the registration office on another day when the said payment has been verified, for the purpose of being issued with a registration certificate.  Otherwise, a situation where a non-national is required to attend at the registration office on a second day will usually arise only where he\/she attends at the office at a time of the day when a significant number of persons availing of the registration service who have arrived earlier in the day, have yet to be attended to.<\/p><p>It is a requirement of the registration function that persons seeking to register present in person to their local registration office.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  The registration process includes an interview with the person, the examination of relevant documentation, photographing and biometric capture and the issuing of a registration certificate.  It also includes the placing of the appropriate permission to remain endorsement on the passport of the person concerned.  It should also be noted that for most persons, renewal of their registration is at most a yearly requirement and that for the majority of customers the GNIB provides a same day service<i><\/i>at its Burgh Quay office.<\/p><p>As I indicated in earlier replies on this matter, it is my intention to transfer the registration of non nationals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  This work is underway and it is also intended to develop customer services such as on-line booking systems to ensure greater certainty for the customer.<\/p><p>I place a high value on customer service and both GNIB and INIS will continue to examine and introduce any practical changes to improve the customer experience and to ameliorate demand.  Naturally, any public office operates with a fixed capacity and at particularly busy periods and not withstanding any arrangements put in place, there may be occasions when, based on the numbers seeking to register and estimated processing times, processing capacity is reached for that day; persons attending beyond that point will be asked to return at another time.  In such circumstances GNIB &amp;amp; INIS manage demand on the day in a  sensible, proactive and safe manner. There is no necessity for people to queue outside of office opening hours. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900093#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900093#WRX00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1170,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[21299\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900093#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014; when the Bill will be enacted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[21729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900093#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to publish the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 before the summer recess; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 556 together.<\/p><p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.

All information that the applicant wishes to have taken into consideration should be included with their application.  <\/p>  <p>  Where the stated purpose of the application is to marry in Ireland, it is advisable to provide evidence of that intention in the form of an acknowledgement from the Registrar.  The applicant must show evidence of their relationship with their prospective spouse. The list of documents required are attached on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The appropriate type of visa is a short stay visa under which the maximum stay allowed is 90 days. <\/p>  <p>  As with all applications for short stay visas, the applicant must show that they have sufficiently strong family, social or economic ties to a place of residence in a country other than Ireland to assure the visa officer assessing the application that the projected stay in Ireland will be temporary and in accordance with the duration and the conditions of the permission granted by the immigration authorities on arrival in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Where the stated purpose of the application is to join family in Ireland, the comprehensive statement of national immigration policy on the area of family reunification contained in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification was published on 31 December 2013.  This outlines the policies that apply to all decision making in relation to family reunification cases.<\/p>  <p>  The financial consideration for the Join Family visa where the sponsor is an Irish Citizen states that an Irish Citizen must not have been totally or predominantly reliant on benefits from the Irish State for a continuous period in excess of two years immediately prior to the application and must over the 3 year period prior to the application have earned a cumulative gross income over and above any State benefits of not less than &euro;40,000.<\/p>  <p>  Declared and verified savings by the sponsor or the applicant may be taken into account in assessing cases.  It is not proposed that the Family Reunification determinations should be purely financial assessments.  Nevertheless, the State cannot be regarded as having an obligation to subsidise the family concerned and the sponsor must be seen to fulfil their responsibility to provide for his family if they are permitted to come to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines on the visa application process can be found on the INIS website (www.inis.gov.ie).

However, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to my proposal, approved by Government on 6 May 2015, for the drafting of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill which will provide for the introduction of additional measures for the enforcement of civil debt.<\/p><p>The proposed Bill will implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in relation to the enforcement of debt.  The<b><i><\/i><\/b>LRC Report published in 2010 on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement<\/i>made a number of recommendations for wide scale reform of the existing personal insolvency and debt enforcement regimes.  Key elements of that Report were implemented through enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p><p>The new Bill seeks to implement further recommendations of the Report aimed at enforcement and recovery of debts which could be developed to streamline the existing enforcement procedures. Under the proposed Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, creditors may apply to the court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debts to which the legislation will apply.  Attachment of earnings would arise where a court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor. Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s social welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.  However, these provisions will be subject to a number of safeguards for debtors and will have regard to the debtor's capacity to repay the amount owed.<\/p><p>Importantly, the Bill will also make provision to provide for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law proceedings.  This implements one of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  Under existing law, arrest and imprisonment remains a possibility as an enforcement mechanism of last resort in cases where a creditor has proved beyond all reasonable doubt the judgment debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  The proposed Bill removes this possibility for the vast majority of debtors.&quot;<\/p><p>The Bill is currently being drafted.  It is expected to be published this month with a view to enactment before the Summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900095#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges","counter":1285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900095#WRZ00575"},{"type":"question","counter":1286,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[21971\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900095#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out the total funding provided for each of the years 2009 to 2014, inclusive, and for 2015 to date by her Department to a refuge (details supplied) in Dublin 17.","asker":"959","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1287,"content":"<p>The organisation in question was granted &euro;3,000 in funding in 2009 by my Department through Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.

This includes a provision of &euro;992 million in current expenditure and &euro;35 million in capital expenditure, which in Vote terms, represents an overall increase of &euro;30 million, or 3%, over the 2014 allocation. <\/p>  <p>  The Estimate for 2015 contains significant additional resources to fund the services and programmes provided by Tusla - the Child and Family Agency. This amounts to &euro;643 million, which accounts for 63% of the Vote allocation, and represents an increase of &euro;34 million or 5% against the 2014 allocation. While I understand that this level of funding cannot address all of the challenges that the  Agency faces in doing its work, I believe that the additional funding allows the Agency to alleviate the pressures on the range of services currently in place.  It will also help Tusla to build on the extensive programme of reform across the range of services for children and young people, a process which is well underway. Officials in my Department continue to closely monitor the cash position of Tusla and are working on an ongoing basis to monitor its financial requirement. Any discussions regarding additional resources for Tusla will take place in the context of the Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that there were 1,425.02 whole time equivalent social workers employed at the end of April 2015 and that they are currently recruiting an additional 124 social workers to meet existing vacancies. While a zero rate of vacancies in this specialised area of work would be ideal, it is important to acknowledge that, as staffing vacancies arise for a variety of reasons, including retirements, career breaks, paid and unpaid leave (including maternity and other family related leave) and resignations, in that context there will always be gaps in timing around the filling of posts. Every effort is being made by the Agency to speed up recruitment and develop a comprehensive workforce development plan in 2015 which will assist in addressing staff turnover rates and hopefully lower them further. <\/p>  <p>  The policy in place and utilised by Tusla states that all children coming into care, and those in high risk placements, have an allocated social worker.  Maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities all contribute to gaps in staffing, which can cause strain on the allocation of social workers.  According to Tusla policy, where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, they are responded to by a duty team on a risk management basis for any change in circumstances.  During this time, specific pieces of work on the child's case may be undertaken by staff working in the duty system. Also, structures are in place to regulate and inspect service provision, including the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I am satisfied that, overall, the necessary services and supports are in place to ensure the care and welfare of children in State care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900097#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900097#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":623,"qnumall":"[21928\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900097#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on changing the eligibility criteria for the free pre-school year in order that it can be availed of by a child aged three years; if not, the reason eligibility is restricted to children aged three years and three months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>The objective of the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.

These Regulations will introduce a new registration system that will require anyone who wants to establish an early years service to register with Tusla before they open.  Premises will be inspected by the Early Years Inspectorate before registration is granted, and there will be on-going inspections once the service is operating and children are attending.  These new Regulations will also be accompanied by new National Standards for Early Years Services, against which services will be inspected. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this work, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills is leading focussed inspections of the quality of educational provision in the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme.<\/p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years settings are also planned. All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification. In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent to qualify for ECCE.

The aim of Better Start is to provide a nationally coherent continuum of support to providers to help them to improve quality, incorporating the work of the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations.  Each year, my Department provides some &euro;13 million to City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisation.

The more extensive process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a very significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Group's Report cites a range of academic research and published social histories which explore matters related to Mother and Baby Homes and demonstrates that concerns in relation to the role and purpose of these institutions have been the subject of attention, report and debate since their establishment in the early years of the State.<\/p><p>This work culminated in the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in February 2015. Using its extensive legal powers, this Commission is now examining matters within its comprehensive terms of reference to ensure that what happened to vulnerable women and children in Mother and Baby Homes is fully examined. Its findings will be published.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, together with the terms of reference set out in S.I. No. 57 of 2015, provides this Commission with all necessary powers to comprehensively examine the broad range of public concerns that have been expressed in relation to mother and baby homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900098#WRCC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":1470,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900098#WRCC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1471,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[22135\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900098#WRCC01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he is aware of any allegations of abuse in relation to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who has been in the care of the State for almost two years, and the action he will take regarding same.","asker":"1192","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1472,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not appropriate for me to comment on an individual case but I have forwarded the information provided by the Deputy to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, for immediate attention.<\/p>  <p>  It is proper that allegations of child abuse should be reported to the local Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, office in the first instance and, where the allegations are of criminal nature, to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Reporting on these rates has been hampered by different definitions of stillbirth both nationally and internationally. In Ireland, four difference agencies are involved in the compilation and reporting of perinatal data mortality data.  The analysis presented in the Report of the Chief Medical Officer into Perinatal Deaths in Portlaoise Hospital (February 2014) showed that there are weaknesses and inconsistencies in perinatal data collection, collation and reporting.<\/p>  <p>  A number of actions are being taken to address these discrepancies as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - The notification of stillbirths is a mandatory requirement in the Civil Registration Act (2004).  This Act was amended in 2014 to make notification of early neonatal deaths mandatory.  The General Registration Office is working on the commencement of this.<\/p>  <p>  - In addition the HSE has agreed to progress agreement of definitions and reporting of perinatal statistics in Ireland.

Given the small numbers involved the use of perinatal mortality rates by hospital as an indicator of patient safety creates a risk of false reassurance and also can raise false alerts.  It is, therefore, important to look at these in conjunction with, for example, confidence intervals per hospital and other methods in order to distinguish between the stability of estimates based on small versus large numbers.

Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended.  It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs.  Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system.  Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).  <\/p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals.  The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015-2017.  Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900100#WREE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":1589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900100#WREE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1590,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[21407\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900100#WREE02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 324 of 19 May 2015, the estimated number of patients who will benefit from the diabetes cycle of care, which is to cost an estimated &euro;4.5 million in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1591,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.

A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is almost complete, and it will be finalised and made public as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900102#WRGG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900102#WRGG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":708,"qnumall":"[21653\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900102#WRGG01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the details of the number of consultants employed at Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, County Laois in each of the years 2009 to 2014 and in 2015 to date, by speciality; if he will provide details of vacant consultant posts at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise; his plans to fill extra posts in 2015, 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1700,"qnumday":709,"qnumall":"[21654\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015060900102#WRGG02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details, in tabular form, of the total staff numbers employed at Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, County Laois, by specialty, for each of the years 2008 to 2014 and for 2015 to date; if he will provide details of new posts to be filled in 2015 and 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1701,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 708 and 709 together.<\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on these matters.
