Significant progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, with an increase of 23% of female participation in the PDF since 2002.  However, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  As at 31 March 2014, the latest date for which figures are available there were 555 women out of a total strength of 9,133 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<\/p><p>  - the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,<\/p><p>  - special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,<\/p><p>  - there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,<\/p><p>  - all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,<\/p><p>  - a Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.<\/p><p>  I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that not alone support increased female participation in the Defence Forces but also support increased diversity. The personnel profile of the Defence Forces should reflect the changing demographic and multicultural nature of Irish Society.  To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. This was part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media. At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[20059\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will expand on media reports in County Kildare that plans are at an advanced stage to develop voluntary housing for ex-servicemen and their families who are currently classified as over-holders by his Department.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>I am not aware of the media Reports to which the Deputy refers.

The Department of Defence does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for those who are not members of the Defence Forces.  As I have said previously, I cannot support the illegal occupation of military property by those who have no entitlement in this regard and who may well have the means to acquire housing for themselves.  In accordance with normal procedures my Department will continue to seek vacant possession of married quarters which are being overheld until the overholding issue is resolved.<\/p><p>   I recognise that there are a very small number of people currently in possession of houses in the Camp who, due to exceptional circumstances, deserve particular consideration when their cases are being processed. Accordingly I have asked that the remaining overholding cases at the Camp be examined with a view to identifying the small sub-set of cases which may be vulnerable from an accommodations perspective.  This case review is progressing and officials in my Department will engage with this small number of individuals in the coming weeks.  In light of and subject to their particular circumstances, my Department would be prepared to provide whatever assistance and support it can to the individuals concerned.

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 192 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 135 Defence Forces personnel. <\/p><p>Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel. Five (5) personnel were deployed in August 2013 for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan. Ireland also contributes 26 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions, 3 personnel to the Nordic Battle group headquarters in Sweden and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces completed their withdrawal from the EU Training Mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia) on 14 April 2014.  The Defence Forces had been serving with that mission since April 2010.  Ireland also provided the Mission Commander during the period August 2011 to February 2014.<\/p><p>Ireland has participated in ISAF in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002.  In March 2011, the transition process whereby the Afghan security forces would gradually take on more security responsibility from ISAF was launched. This process is due to be completed at the end of this year, when ISAF&rsquo;s mission will end. The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. While it is anticipated that Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in September 2014, this will be kept under review in the context of the current proposed follow on training mission.  <\/p><p>With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, no further requests for such deployments are currently pending in my Department.  Due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Force in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time.  The current contribution of some 410 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.<\/p><p><b><i>AS OF 04 MAY 2014<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>1.<\/th><th>UN MISSIONS<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNIFIL 42nd Infantry Group<\/td><td><div>176<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp; Syria<\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria<\/td><td><div>135<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UNMAS (United Nations Mine Action Service ) South Sudan<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>354<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)<\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)<\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS<\/td><td><div>388<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2.<\/td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>OSCE Mission in Belgrade &ndash; Serbia<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3.<\/td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Brussels<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4.<\/td><td>NORDIC BATTLE GROUP 2015<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>FHQ Sweden<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5.<\/td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES\/ADVISERS\/STAFF<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO\/PfP (Brussels)<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS<\/td><td><div>410<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks Closures","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[20060\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700043#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the security and other costs of the Army barracks which were closed during the term of this Government; and the plans for their future use.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>During the term of this Government four barracks have been closed &ndash; Kickham Barracks Clonmel, O&rsquo; Neill Barracks Cavan, Columb Barracks Mullingar and Mitchell Barracks Castlebar.

The three Brigade structure then in place had originally been designed in the 1990s, when the strength ceiling of the PDF was 11,500 personnel. Clearly, at a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel, this structure was no longer viable.  In this context, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces encompassing the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades. This was to ensure that within the revised strength ceiling, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force was optimised in order to fulfil all roles assigned by Government. <\/p><p>  Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength Units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational Units. <\/p><p>  A new White Paper on Defence is due to be completed and submitted to Government for approval later this year. Work on the new White Paper on Defence is progressing well.

The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.<\/p><p>Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but\u00a0I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012\/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.

At this time less than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within the month, while close to 40% of all credit unions have a restriction on commercial lending activity.<\/p><p>  For those credit unions where there is an individual loan size restriction in place, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans significantly\u00a0greater than the average loan for the sector of just above &euro;6,000. Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns advised to the credit union. These restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis.<\/p><p>\u00a0 Section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act, 1997 permits a credit union to have up to 30% of its\u00a0loan book outstanding for more than\u00a05 years and up to 10% of its loan book outstanding for more than 10 years.\u00a0Based on the most recent\u00a0information provided\u00a0by credit unions \u00a0to the Central Bank in the December 2013 quarterly prudential returns,\u00a0average lending over 5 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0some 11%, while average lending over 10 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0about 2%.

Revenue confirmed that as a result of a comprehensive data matching exercise they have matched 1.27 million properties, for which the Household Charge (HHC) was paid, to the LPT register. \u00a0As the Deputy is aware, from Revenue published statistics, LPT returns were made in respect of 1.69 million properties (other than Local Authority\/Social Housing).\u00a0 It is absolutely essential from a fairness perspective to the vast majority of house owners who have paid the HHC and LPT that Revenue follows through on those who have not.<\/p><p>In this context Revenue has identified a database of properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) is still outstanding but has stated at all times that the database is not 100% accurate for a number of reasons. The two main reasons are:<\/p><p>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.<\/p><p>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.\u00a0 For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.<\/p><p>In addition there are some examples where the LGMA register did not fully record situations where the HHC was paid to a Local Authority directly.\u00a0 In all their communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due. <\/p><p>Revenue has provided a new online service to facilitate property owners to make payment, or to indicate that they have already paid or are exempt. Any person who has paid or is exempt from the HHC and have received a reminder letter should contact Revenue through the online LPT service at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT Helpline and their HHC record will be updated once contact is made online or through the Helpline service.\u00a0 The LPT Helpline service at 1890200255 has been open on an extended basis, to facilitate HHC queries, from 8am to 8pm since Tuesday 22 April. <\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, on 18 February Revenue announced a six-week period to enable those who had not paid the HHC to pay or arrange payment of the &euro;200 charge to prevent any further interest and penalties. It carried out a significant media campaign advising people that they could check if they were on the arrears database by going online at . In the current phase of the campaign Revenue is writing to those property owners on the arrears database. This letter does four things:<\/p><p>- tells the property owner that per Revenue's records the property is on the arrears database,<\/p><p>- advises property owners \u00a0who had paid the HHC or whose property was not liable for the HHC to contact Revenue to correct the database,<\/p><p>- advises those who are liable to pay the charge to prevent additional interest accruing, and<\/p><p>- advises those who do not, of the next steps that Revenue will take to collect the charge.<\/p><p>In no sense could this approach amount to issuing threatening letters. The letters are a necessary step in ensuring compliance with the Household Charge.\u00a0 Revenue has matched the vast majority of those who have paid the HHC. However, any data matching exercise of this type will not succeed in 100% matching and this is why Revenue is writing to those on the database to enable them tell Revenue that they have paid the HHC.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding refunds of HHC, any refund claims relating to HHC arrears paid to Revenue on or after 1st July 2013 will be repaid in accordance with Section 26 of the 2012 Finance (Local Property Tax) Act (as amended). A refund will be issued where a claim is submitted to Revenue and is approved for repayment or where an overpayment is identified by Revenue.<\/p><p>Regarding the Deputy's reference to my Department contacting the Comptroller and Auditor General, as the Deputy will have seen from the foregoing there was no question of a lapse in oversight. There are perfectly valid reasons why Revenue has been unable to fully identify those who have paid the HHC or are exempt, or entitled to a waiver, from the charge and Revenue has stated this at all times in relation to LPT and the HHC arrears. I am very satisfied that Revenue has done an excellent job in relation to all aspects of LPT, including securing a 94% compliance rate in relation to\u00a0 2013 LPT.\u00a0 I have no doubt that the C&amp;amp;AG will, in the course of its annual review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, examine various aspects of the introduction of LPT and Revenue will, as they always do, co-operate fully with the C&amp;amp;AG and will seek to constantly improve its systems and processes in light of live operational experience.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue has committed significant resources to compile as accurately as possible details of HHC non-compliant property owners. They have sought to fully explain why a letter may, despite their best efforts, have issued to a compliant property owner. Considering the number of property owners receiving correspondence in connection with the current compliance campaign, the level of error being reported by property owners to the LPT Branch, other than those explained by me earlier, is a very small proportion of the overall numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700045#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700046#WRD00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Tuition Scheme Funding","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700046#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[20391\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700046#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will reconsider a grant application for home tuition in respect of a student (details supplied) with a view to backdating the approval to the date the application was originally submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.

The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.<\/p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction.

A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013\/2014 for this purpose. Forty-six schools, with 115 prefab units, will be offered grants to provide the new facilities. Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The Plan will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers.

Contracts are awarded following a competitive process conducted in compliance with the established procurement rules and procedures.<\/p><p>Under EU Directives on public procurement public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.<\/p><p>The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules<\/p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The EU average for cross border activity in relation to above threshold procurements is 1.4%. I am informed that the figure of 28% is not based on OGP data. The following information has been complied by the OGP and is based on data available on above EU threshold awards:<\/p><p>- In 2011, 10.55% (valued at &euro;240 million) of the total known awarded contracts above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies. This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). I am advised by the OGP that more up to date data on above EU threshold contracts for 2012 and 2013 will be available later this year; <\/p><p>- Analysis of cross border procurement by country, carried out by the EU Commission in 2012, shows that small countries tend to award more cross border contracts (the range is between 5 and 15% in 2011). The comparable figure for Ireland is 10.55%. \u00a0In Ireland's case the reasons for this level of cross border procurement would include:<\/p><p>- There are a significant number of procurement categories which are not supplied locally (i.e. fuel, vehicles, heavy machinery, pharmaceuticals, IT and certain telecommunications equipment);<\/p><p>- The fact that the vast majority of public procurement opportunities in Ireland are advertised in the English language makes our tender documents accessible to an increasing number of economic operators across Europe, for whom English is the preferred second language;<\/p><p>In terms of the overall data, the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Poland and Italy are responsible for about three quarters of all EU public procurement, both in number of contracts and in value.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such\u00a0as\u00a0nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to maximising procurement opportunities which actively assist job growth and benefit the wider economy.\u00a0 The public sector has an immense purchasing power, spending in the region of &euro;8.5 billion per annum on goods and services. This is in addition to expenditure on public works.\u00a0 This level of expenditure by the public sector affords significant business opportunities for firms that can supply the products and services that are required by public bodies.<\/p><p>The Government also acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  In order to encourage greater SME participation the Office of Government Procurement has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.\u00a0 This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale\u00a0'Meet the\u00a0Buyer' events hosted nationwide.\u00a0 These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade-Ireland. To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.\u00a0 These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.<\/p><p>My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.\u00a0 Circular 10\/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.\u00a0 These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts. The guidelines promote the setting of relevant and proportionate financial capacity, turnover and insurance levels for tendering firms and the sub-dividing larger contracts into lots, where\u00a0appropriate, to enable SMEs to bid for these opportunities. The guidelines also encourage SMEs to form consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right and to register on to ensure maximum exposure to tendering opportunities.<\/p><p>The guidelines accelerate some of the key business-friendly initiatives included under the new EU Public Procurement Directive, currently being transposed by my Department.\u00a0 The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.\u00a0 The SME Working Group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from ISME, IBEC, Inter Trade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Ireland.\u00a0The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.<\/p><p>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.\u00a0 The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700054#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700055#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[20516\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700055#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 4 March 2014, if he has completed his considerations on the issue; the outcome of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>Section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 provides that persons retiring before 31 August 2014, or a later date made by Order under the Act, will be entitled to\u00a0have their pensions calculated as if the pay reduction and any increment pause or freeze had not applied to them.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. <\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.<\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry, 18 areas in County Kildare and 108 areas in County Cork will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out a fibre-based broadband networks in Counties Kerry and Kildare, which includes rolling out those services in Ballybunion and Killorgan in County Kerry and Naas in County Kildare by July 2016.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700058#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700059#WRR00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700059#WRR00450"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[20378\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700059#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"with regard to the reorganisation of the Avondhu Blackwater Partnership Ltd. and Leader groups throughout the country, the measures he has introduced to ensure that rural communities will not lose community workers; the safeguards that have been put in place in order that the community spirit and co-operation that has been built up by Leader groups over the years will not be lost; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>The changes that I am bringing forward under the reform of local government and arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014, will see the establishment of Local Community Development Committees in each local authority area.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current, level both at home and overseas, on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- <\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.<\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. <\/p><p>  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As the negotiation process with the Representative Association is very much on-going, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council.  However, I do understand the concerns this issue raises for enlisted personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families. I am also cognisant of the need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas. It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place.<\/p><p>  As discussions under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700062#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Appeals","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV00075"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[20395\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV00100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an agri-environment options scheme appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. <\/p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land.  In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme.  This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned.  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme.  If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019.  Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014.  I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%.  These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes.  The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[20565\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700063#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 195 of 2 April 2014, when a REP scheme payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>The person named commenced REPS 4 in June 2008 and received payments for the first five years of their contract.

A review of the childcare support programmes is being undertaken by my Department this year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure the best use of the investment which is currently being made in this area.  All proposals relating to childcare supports will be considered as part of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700065#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700065#WRX00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700065#WRX00550"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[20388\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700065#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the report on fluoride in the public water supply commissioned by his Department will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.

Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700067#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700068#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[20500\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050700068#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford.

There are no current plans to extend the function of the NTPF beyond the remit of hospital treatment.
