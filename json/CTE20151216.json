This is to empower the National Transport Authority, NTA, to make by-laws in respect of public transport passenger services which will be tendered to commence operations in late 2016 or early 2017.  In the event that incumbent operators do not win the tender it is necessary for the NTA to have powers to make by-laws in respect of public services to be provided by new operators.  Coras Iompar &Eacute;ireann, CIE, has statutory powers to make the equivalent by-laws to regulate the public transport passenger services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The proposed new section 56A sets out the standard range of operational activities in respect of which the by-laws may be applied.  Section 56B is to provide for the appointment by the NTA of authorised persons to ensure the users of the public transport services comply with the section 56A by-laws.  The new section 56C sets out the powers of the authorised persons who have been appointed under section 56B, while the new section 56D is an enforcement measure to provide that authorised persons may serve fixed charge notices in respect of alleged offences and sets out the procedural aspects of the fixed charge processes. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 is to require that notification of the making of by-laws for Luas passenger services and copies of draft and final by-laws be published online.

The Deputy tabled similar amendments during the passage of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the proposed dispensation for those convicted of offences covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, it was pointed out at the time that it was not appropriate to specify such inclusion in the context of the proposed legislation.  Section 10 of the 2013 Act provides for the consideration of such offences among the matters to be included in the assessment of the suitability of a licence applicant and licence holder.  Sections 30 and 31 of the Act provide for mandatory disqualification on conviction for specified offences and an obligation to notify conviction for these offences to the licensing authority.  In the case of the most serious indictable offences specified under section 30(2) of the Act, the disqualification applies whether the person has been convicted before or after commencement of the subsection. <\/p> <p>  The specification of offences to which mandatory disqualification applies is based on the principle of ensuring the welfare and safety of passengers.  Nevertheless, because of the restriction this places on the possibility of persons&rsquo; participation in the industry, the grounds for mandatory disqualification were, for legal reasons, narrowly defined.  It is not possible in legislation to seek to further redefine instances where there may be mitigating circumstances.  The mandatory disqualification provision, therefore, relies on specified offences which relate to specific violent activities, rather than a focus on any specific type or group of people.  That is why the 2013 Act makes specific provision for an appeal to the courts in respect of mandatory disqualification such that exceptions are possible where the courts determine they are appropriate.  The courts are positioned to make that judgment.  We have exchanged views on this issue on several occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#D00800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>We are well over 15 years into the Good Friday Agreement.

The relevant Act currently requires that when a fixed payment notice is affixed to a parked vehicle, a fixed payment notice must be subsequently sent to the person who is the registered owner of the vehicle.  The amendment is to avoid potential confusion and duplication in enforcement administration by clarifying that a copy of the original notice affixed to a vehicle should subsequently be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle.<\/p><p>The second amendment is to subsection (3)(b) and provides for an extension of the time period during which a fixed payment notice can be paid from 21 days to 28.

This failure to ratify has led to infringement proceedings being taken against Ireland by the European Commission.  As a result and following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I have decided that Ireland should expedite the ratification of the convention by means of primary legislation.  Irish Rail has been fully consulted on the matter.  Enactment of legislation in this area is unlikely to have any significant practical impact on rail operators or rail passengers in the State as the majority of the provisions of the convention were already covered by terms and conditions of contracts or provided for by EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#E02600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I have concerns about whether this could put pressure on the sector to privatise.

I made it very clear that owing to the way the Irish rail market was organised, its size and geographical isolation, I did not believe it was appropriate to introduce mandatory tendering for the entire market in Ireland.  This was reflected in the decision of the Council, which is now subject to negotiation and discussion in the European Parliament.
