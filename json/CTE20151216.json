I am accompanied by Mr. Derek Ryan, a member of the board of directors, and Mr. Richard Dillon, house manager of our largest residential home in Smithfield in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann, the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, is the oldest established veterans organisation in Ireland.  ONE was established in 1951 with the amalgamation of the National Federation of Irish Ex-Servicemen and the Association of Regular Ex-Servicemen with the original intention of forming a single organisation to advance the general welfare of former members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  Currently there are currently approximately 1,400 members in over 40 branches throughout Ireland and overseas.<\/p> <p>  There were a number of tragic deaths of ex-servicemen on the streets of Dublin in the winter of 1988-89.  As a result of these deaths a change in focus in ONE was needed and the decision was made to establish a residence for homeless ex-service personnel.  This goal was achieved with the opening of the first Br&uacute; na bhFiann, a 20-bed home in Queen Street in Dublin in 1994.  Since then further homes have been opened in Letterkenny, which is a seven-bed home, and Athlone, also with seven beds.  A number of drop-in centres have been opened or are in development to cater for welfare issues of the ex-service community and their families.  The home in Queen Street was replaced in 2005 with a new 40 en suite bedroom Br&uacute; na bhFiann in North King Street.  This currently serves as the ONE headquarters as well as our premier home.<\/p> <p>  ONE was incorporated in 2000, Reg No: 328824, and is a company limited by guarantee without share capital.  ONE is a registered charity, with Revenue No. CHY:13868 and regulatory authority No. RCN: 20044268.  As a limited company, ONE accounts are audited and published annually.  Audits of the local branch accounts are held annually by external auditors along with directors of the ONE.<\/p> <p>  The main object of ONE is the welfare of ex-service personnel, by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled ex-service personnel in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and any other assistance required.<\/p><p>The charity has a number of subsidiary objectives - namely, to promote social, cultural and athletic activities; to develop a spirit of comradeship between serving and retired members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann; to foster public interest in &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann; to maintain liaison with organisations of ex-servicemen and  ex-servicewomen in the European Union; and to do all such other things as will assist in achieving the above objectives and aims.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of funding, ONE funding is mainly achieved through fundraising.  Our main fundraiser is the Fuchsia Appeal, which runs throughout the year, with the main push taking place in July, the month in which the national day of remembrance takes place.  The fuchsia is intended as a generic emblem of remembrance to honour those currently in service and as a fundraiser.  The fuchsia was chosen as it is apolitical, grows widely throughout Ireland and is known in the west of Ireland as deora D&eacute;, or God&rsquo;s tears.  Two Irish Defence Force soldiers, Patrick Mullins from Kilbeheny on the Limerick-Tipperary border and Caomh&aacute;n Seoighe from Inis O&iacute;rr, did not return from overseas service in the Congo and Lebanon, respectively, and are still officially listed as missing in action.  All of the foregoing were considered when the fuchsia was chosen.  The first Fuchsia Appeal was launched in 2009 and raised &euro;14,000.  The 2014 appeal raised &euro;56,000.  This year, the amount is similar.  It is our intention that the fuchsia will be adopted as the official emblem of remembrance, and we want to see it worn widely by the Defence Forces, those in the public service, politicians and the media in the month of July, similar to the wearing of the poppy in the UK, and more recently in Ireland, during the month of November and <i>le bleuet de France<\/i>, the cornflower.<br\/><br\/>Other fundraising methods include a weekly lotto, a Defence Forces race day, raffles, flag days, church gate collections and other events.  These events are organised and run by our members within branches throughout the country.  We also receive support from some serving and retired service personnel in the form of fixed donations through their salaries or pensions.<br\/><br\/>As a charity providing accommodation within three local authority areas, we receive some funding.  However, it is disappointing that the level is so low considering the number of homeless ex-service personnel that we cater for.  Each bed in emergency accommodation in Dublin costs approximately &euro;28,000 a year, with beds in supported temporary accommodation costing approximately &euro;29,000.  These figures are from the State's most recent homeless implementation plan.  The nightly cost per person is approximately &euro;75.  Br&uacute; na bhFiann receives &euro;182,850 in section 10 funding annually from Dublin City Council.  This equates to approximately &euro;16.69 per person per night.  We do not receive any funding on an ongoing basis from Westmeath County Council.Custume House received &euro;1,000 in grant funding in 2015.  This equates to approximately 39 cent per night.  We do not receive any funding on an ongoing basis from Donegal County Council.Beechwood House received &euro;350 in grant funding in 2015.  This equates to approximately 14 cent per night.  These figures are shocking.  However, all three local authorities provided substantial capital funding to the homes during the refurbishment and purchase stages.<br\/><br\/>ONE has a very close relationship with other veteran organisations, in particular the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA.In conjunction with IUNVA and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO, ONE advocates of behalf of veterans.  All three organisations meet regularly and hold discussions with the Department of Defence officials and other Departments as required.  ONE and IUNVA also host training courses together, such as welfare case worker training courses, two of which were held in 2015.  A veteran&rsquo;s affairs policy has been agreed between the three ex-service personnel organisations and it is hoped this will form the blueprint for the future of the State's response to ex-service personnel issues and their interaction with the Department of Defence and the military authorities while no longer serving.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of aspects to ONE.  As a unique organisation and based upon the loyalty and comradeship that is fostered in the military, ONE ensures that there is a social aspect to the organisation.  Therefore, at national level, it regularly organises overseas trips to historical sites, and weekend and day trips to places of interest within Ireland are organised by the various branches.  These events are all self-financing and moneys raised for charitable purposes are used for that purpose only. <br\/><br\/>ONE takes part in various ceremonial events nationally and locally, such as the annual Niemba ambush remembrance ceremony, which is hosted by ONE,  and the national day of remembrance.  These events are an important part of our business.  Military service can be arduous and people have given the ultimate sacrifice both at home and on foreign service.  Therefore, we organise remembrance events that families and former colleagues attend to remember those who have passed.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, we are primarily a charitable organisation catering for and advocating on behalf of the needs of homeless ex-service personnel within our society.  To do this we fundraise and depend on donations and grant aid from the State.  This grant aid is much appreciated, but it needs to be increased substantially.  As can be ascertained from the figures above, we provide 16,060 bed nights per year to homeless ex-service colleagues.  This is a substantial figure to cater for, considering the implications if these people were still living in the various hostels and overnight accommodation available nationwide.  We therefore are continuing during 2016 to engage and lobby the State and other bodies for funding and resources to enable us as a charity to shoulder the burden of housing those ex-service personnel, thereby relieving the already strained Exchequer of direct responsibility.  We seek this committee's continued support and help in raising our profile and creating public and State awareness of issues with regard to homeless ex-service personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ollie O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for his presentation and for the work his organisation is doing.

I hope we can flesh out these points in the subsequent discussion.<br\/><br\/>During the late 1980s, there was a growing interest among serving and retired members of the Defence Forces in the idea of establishing an organisation that would represent those who had volunteered to serve overseas and who had made a valuable contribution to world peace.  From the departure of the first Irish volunteers to the Lebanon in 1958 to 1990, more than 32,000 Irish troops have served with the United Nations in various trouble spots around the world.  The first formal meeting to discuss the establishment of IUNVA was held in Dublin on 10 February 1990 and an interim committee was formed.  At the first annual general meeting on 6 October 1990, held in the Eastern Health Board social club at Grangegorman, the constitution of IUNVA was ratified and the first national executive committee was elected.  The constitution stated,<i>inter alia,<\/i>that the association would be non-political, non-sectarian and non-denominational.  The Minister for Defence gave formal approval for the formation of the association.  Membership was to be offered to any Irish citizen who had satisfactorily completed a tour of duty with a United Nations peacekeeping force or another UN-backed organisation, whether he or she was serving or retired.  Hence, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilian personnel who fulfilled the foregoing criteria were welcome to join IUNVA.<br\/><br\/>With a national executive established in Dublin, the next move was to establish what we called posts throughout the country.  Post 1 was established in Dublin, soon to be followed by plans for posts in Dundalk, Wexford and Kildare.  The early months and years of the organisation were hectic.  Properties had to be found, a flag, crest and uniform designed and standing orders drawn up to ensure the proper day-to-day running of the association.  Today, IUNVA has 21 posts around the country, in locations stretching from Donegal to Galway, Kerry, Cork, Wexford and throughout the midlands.  These posts represent an active membership of 1,200.  The families and extended families of active and deceased members who benefit from the services and activities of IUNVA also constitute quite a significant number.  The pride and pleasure that members taken in their posts is there for all to see.  A post is a social club, a second home, a home where the hundreds of photographs and memorabilia decorating the walls tell their own stories.<\/p><p>Post 1 IUNVA is located at Arbour Hill and is adjacent to the 1916 plot.  I extend an invitation to all members of the joint committee to visit Post 1 to see, at first hand, exactly what I have talked about.<\/p><p> The aims and objectives of the association give a very good idea of the activities of its members.  These objectives include: to provide an advice and counselling service for members and their families; to organise social, cultural and sporting activities for members and their families; and to establish, maintain and encourage contact with associations similarly constituted in other countries.  In order to deal with the welfare needs of members and their families the association has a national welfare officer and there are also trained welfare offices in all of the posts.  The advice and assistance of these officers is regularly requested and greatly valued.<\/p><p> IUNVA works closely with ONE and has a seat on the Defence Forces benevolent fund board.  IUNVA is often the first point of contact for former members of the Defence Forces who have fallen on hard times.  When a member or former member of IUNVA dies, we ensure, irrespective of his or her circumstances, that the deceased gets a proper burial which recognises the service he or she has given.  To this end, IUNVA has purchased a number of plots in cemeteries throughout the country.  Over half of the posts have, with the help and co-operation of their local communities, erected monuments to those who lost their lives in the cause of peace.  At national level, the 93 Irishmen, which includes members of the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians, who lost their lives while serving with the UN are commemorated at an annual wreath-laying ceremony at the IUNVA monument on Arbour Hill in May.  Next year, the ceremony will be held on International Peacekeepers' Day, Sunday, 29 May, and I ask members to note that date in their diaries.<\/p><p> Ceremonies are an important part of our programme every year.  These include national ceremonies and ceremonies organised by IUNVA, ONE, the Royal British Legion and local councils.  The Irish soldier, as a peacekeeper, is second to none and his or her services will continue to be sought by the United Nations.  Peacekeeping is demanding and often dangerous work.  Adjusting to a normal way of life on returning home can make its own demands on individuals.  For these people, IUNVA will be there.  For those who do not return home, IUNVA will ensure that they will never be forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Kerwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kerwin for his statement.

We are very grateful to the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>  Today, the committee is tasked with finding out what supports that the organisations need and how these Houses can assist that process.  My first two questions are for IUNVA and I have some questions for ONE.  IUNVA ensures that members get a proper funeral and burial, which is a hugely important support to provide.  What services does IUNVA provide?  Where does IUNVA's funding come from?  I assume it would be good if IUNVA could secure appropriate funding from State sources that would complement the fundraising efforts of the organisation.  I ask IUNVA to tease out those matters and then it will be the turn of ONE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#D00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Initially, we get &euro;10,000 a year from the Government.

Its an immensely proud day for ONE and for me, as an ex-serviceman, to come here to advocate on behalf of less well-off servicemen from both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will know, we are not a militaristic State but we have contributed hugely and punched above our weight in terms of the United Nations, the EU and everything else that we have contributed troops to over the years.  Public awareness in this country is lacking or is not as robust as in other countries - including our nearest neighbour - where people take immense pride in the service of those who have gone before them.<\/p><p>My role on the board of directors of the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, especially for 2016 as well as in previous years, has been to raise our profile through the fuchsia appeal.  I am delighted to hear Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn has bought into the idea and agrees that the appeal is relevant and unique to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There are 100,000 ex-service personnel, from both the Reserve and Permanent Defence Force, and their families living in the State.  That is a huge number of people who have given service.  We have many former garrison towns in which the military served in past decades and more recently.  There is a network and we are trying to tap into it.  One way for us to raise our profile and ability to fundraise is by getting cross-party support from Deputies, Senators and councillors to wear the fuchsia for the month of July.  They could also try to get national and private broadcasters to buy into the concept that service to the State came at a high price which is still being paid by service personnel who have various issues.  It behoves us, as an organisation, along the Irish UN Veterans Association, IUNVA, and the State to try to look after the people concerned.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. O'Connor mentioned a veterans' affairs policy which we drafted in conjunction with the IUNVA and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO.  The policy sets out, for the first time, a blueprint for how the State can interact with veterans, primarily with ONE and the IUNVA, and then the ARCO.  It sets out what the State can provide and how it should provide it.  In a utopian world the State would supply everything, but we know that is not possible.  In fairness to the State, the recently retired Chief of Staff, the Defence Forces, the Department and the various agencies involved, they have started to interact at a local level with veterans who are preparing to leave the Defence Forces.  I am speaking primarily about those who may have medical issues.  If they are in the care of consultants or similar, the care will continue after they leave the Defence Forces.  The side gates of barracks, in effect, are left open in order that when these personnel finish their military service, their medical files will be kept by the Defence Forces and they can continue to receive their care.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department, the recently published White Paper on Defence includes veterans' affairs as a policy issue.  It would be brilliant if it was given priority in the future.<br\/><br\/>The next part of the policy was communications.  We have had issues with the various Departments in recent years.  Through no fault of any elected individual or civil servant, there is a distinct lack of understanding of what the fuchsia appeal is actually about.  The ball has been passed from one Department to another which can be quite frustrating, although it is nobody's fault.  In conjunction with our brothers and colleagues in the IUNVA and the ARCO, we have proposed that there be a communications policy drafted between the various stakeholder agencies within the defence family.  That policy would lay out who should contacts whom, what the remit of each department was and who the go-to people were for various issues.  <br\/><br\/>As Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Kirwan have stated, we meet the Department of Defence and the military authorities a number of times a year in force headquarters, FHQ.  We are in the process of setting up an inter-body group to explore this issue further and hope the joint committee will have an input.  Ultimately it is the Executive that will be responsible for implementing our communications policy.  The 2016 centenary commemorations are coming upon us hard and fast.  The Department of the Taoiseach is responsible for certain events, while various other Departments have other responsibilities.  It would be good to tighten up on who has responsibility for what.  From our position, when that happens, there will not be an <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach but a more structured one which will benefit everybody.  That is basically my role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor wanted to come back in briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#E00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn asked if there was tracking of homeless ex-service personnel.

Funding is our top priority.  We spoke about highlighting the need for the Fuchsia appeal.  I am delighted to hear so many Deputies and Senators, including the Chair, stating they would support this appeal in future.  The last element is the idea of veterans' affairs and the covenant.  We spoke about a covenant between the State and its organisations, including veteran organisations.  Topics for discussion among ourselves - and I hope with elected representatives, as God willing, we will see them all in the new year - include terms and conditions of service prior to discharge and retirement for service personnel, both reservists and Permanent Defence Forces personnel.  Some reservists have many decades of service to the State and they do not get a pension.  They are not recognised officially by the State.  It is important that reservists, as well as our Defences Forces, would prior to discharge have some form of interaction with regard to terms and conditions of service.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of health care.  I know young men and women colleagues who have left the Defence Forces.  While they were in the Defence Forces, things happened, and they were in the care of psychiatric staff.<\/p><p>The day they were discharged from the Defence Forces the care and help stopped.  A covenant would fill that crack such that the health care would continue.  It is cost neutral for the State to do that because the Defence Forces already have the medical personnel and facilities that the former soldier would have had access to, as well as the soldier&rsquo;s file, rather than putting the soldier out the gate to join a long waiting list for a HSE clinic.<\/p><p> Education is another service soldiers need before retirement.  In America and in certain European countries when service men are coming to retirement places are made available for vocational training within local authorities and institutes of technology because while the skills we learn in service are of massive benefit to the State they need to be retuned and re-honed and given direction.  There is a possibility that the State could help service personnel coming out of service to re-skill and up-skill, thereby giving them skill sets so that they do not have to rely on our meagre resources. <\/p><p> They should have priority access to State-sponsored housing schemes.  If they were injured or invalided out of the Defence Forces they need help in ensuring that appropriate accommodation is made available.  Many have been discharged in recent years from the Defence Forces with problems they believe are related to Lariam.  I am not saying they are or not but it is a live topic.  Very young men and women have been discharged and are finding it hard to cope coming out of an institution, whether they have been there for three, six or 21 years, where everything is provided and they have to dip into a meagre pension.  A half pension after 21 years as a private is not a large sum of money.  They need access to financial and tax advice prior to discharge.  When I retired from the Defence Forces the world of tax affairs and filling in tax forms was completely alien to me but I was married to a tax consultant.<\/p><p> The State has a positive moral obligation to maintain the organisations that provide direct access to support for veterans thus allowing those with unique knowledge of prior service to act in the best interests of the veterans.  Military service, like service as an elected representative, is a unique part of Irish society that the greater public does not have access to.

The appropriate supports should be included in the covenant to assist the transition from military life to civilian life.  I spoke about a support post-service to involve an obligation for life to reflect the commitment and sacrifices made by the veterans and their families during service as well as their continuing value to society.  This should be properly recognised in the support they receive but that is not the case at the moment.  Those injured who have service-related health conditions should receive additional support, which may be financial or access to the appropriate social services.  They should get some priority.  The services exist but my experience is that some people have fallen through the cracks, between the Irish United Nations Veterans Association and our organisation, and have ended up in early graves.  <\/p> <p>  Bereaved families should be included in any discussions post-service.  The State has failed abjectly and miserably in respect of families of those who have died in State service because of its bureaucracy, not through wanton malice in any State organisation.

Most recently we were part of the Justice for Smallhorne and Barrett campaign, for two of our comrades who were unlawfully killed while on UN service.

A huge part of our history has been lost in terms of the experience of soldiers on the ground.  We have put together a group within IUNVA to go around the country and sit down with veterans of the Congo and the Middle East to ask them what happened to them and to record their experiences.  Last year I was in the presence of some cadets in the military college and was talking about the Suez Canal, air fights overhead and artillery coming in, and they were looking at me as though I had come from another planet.  I am one of many veterans whose experiences are not recorded anywhere.  We all learned from the people who went out to the Congo without being briefed or prepared, with the consequences we saw, and now we are one of the best prepared and equipped units anywhere in the world.  Irish military personnel are on duty in 16 locations around the world.<\/p> <p>  We would love to see a monument, preferably in Dublin, to what this country has contributed to making this world a better and safer place to live in.  This is not just about the Army but about garda&iacute; as well, and civilians who have gone abroad and made a major contribution to making this world a better and safer place to live in.  It should be recognised and this is something we are pursuing, so I would like members to support it.<\/p> <p>  The Irish soldier is very special overseas.  I was visiting a unit as press officer 20 years ago and there was a soldier on duty who had arrived only a month earlier.  There was a footpath going into the village where he was on duty and, while I was chatting to him and asking him what he was doing and how he was getting on with the local people, he told me to watch a schoolboy, aged six or seven, coming down the path with his schoolbag on his way to school.  As he approached the sentry the soldier came to attention, saluted the little boy and said \"Dia dhuit, Mohammed.\"  The little boy saluted him back and said \"Dia's Muire dhuit, soldier.\"  One cannot train that.  It was this young man's nature, and that was his contribution to peace in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Kerwin"},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>That is unique, indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#J00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>As a card-carrying member of ONE myself, I am delighted to see the witnesses from ONE and the UN vets here today.  When I left the Army back in 1980, soldiers were forgotten once they had walked out the gate.  Many soldiers fell on very hard times and I have met many who fell on hard times that were beyond belief.  ONE and the UN vets have provided a focus for former members to remain engaged and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude for that.<\/p> <p>  On the subject of recognising veterans, it is not uncommon in other parts of the world for veterans to have a lapel badge to identify them as veterans, and that is something we should do.  The idea of a monument to serving members from the civilian forces, the garda&iacute; and the Army is not before time.  My first recollection of the Defence Forces in Ireland was the funerals after the Niemba massacre.  It was on my birthday and I listened all night to the death march on Raidi&oacute; &Eacute;ireann.  I served with Captain Gleeson's brother, Fergus Gleeson, in Galway so I have a huge affinity with them.  We are unique in having provided an army of peace, not a fighting army.  Many of our soldiers have died in the service of peace, not war, and this needs to be recognised.<\/p> <p>  The need for pre-discharge or pre-demobilisation education was raised.  In Carlow recently, I saw 200 members of the Defence Forces of all ranks graduate with FETAC level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 qualifications.  I commend our Defence Forces on this, as we are one of the few armies in the world that have been brave enough to engage with education, and we now have private soldiers with academic qualifications similar to those of their officers.  As I said at a recent EU interparliamentary committee meeting on education, I am concerned by those who do not access education.  There is no requirement to access education, but when a soldier comes to the end of his service, as Mr. Dillon said, he will need skills to survive outside the barracks.  Many in this room will recall the days when soldiers came to the end of their service and quietly lived on in a barracks until they died.  Nobody passed any remarks about the fact that a person was living in such quarters having long since ceased to serve as an active soldier.  This does not happen any more, and soldiers now serve an average of five years.  The turnover is rapid, as job opportunities are there and people are better educated.  After a period of overseas travel they have greater opportunities so they do not stay in the Defence Forces as long as they used to.  <\/p> <p>  Education and health are the two areas we should put some sort of funding towards in recognition of service to the State.  I propose a transition period in the last two years of a soldier's life, to be given over to preparing him, through educational or resettlement programmes, to enter civilian life.  I acknowledge the work of ONE and the UN vets.  The work done by both organisations is incredible in the short time they have been in existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#J00300","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>In our initial oral submission to the White Paper body, one of the points we made was the need to prepare people for civilian life.

We were also looking for simple things, such as showing somebody how to do a CV.  We can strip and assemble a rifle but doing a CV is another thing.  We mentioned transition because other forces have arrangements for the transition to civilian life, in which the last two years, or even six months, of the service of a soldier is devoted to preparing him for civilian life.

The report is primarily about putting garda&iacute; on the front line and providing sufficient numbers of people, strong leadership, supervision, appropriate equipment, good training and the modern technology needed to deliver a better service to all communities in Ireland.  During the review the inspectorate met more than 2,500 employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the report's key findings.  We found an ineffective structure that was struggling to cope with the modern demands on Garda services.  Many headquarters units have duplicate functions in matters such as change management, policy development and oversight.  To protect front-line services, all other police services from around the globe with which we engaged in the review have restructured, reduced the number of administrative areas and now operate from far leaner structures, with fewer senior managers.  We found that national and specialist Garda units were very much Dublin based and Dublin focused.  The current structure which encompasses six regions, 28 divisions and 96 districts is highly inefficient and impacts negatively on the deployment of resources.  Centralised decision-making takes place even on lower level issues that could be handled at sergeant or inspector level.<\/p> <p>  On the deployment of resources, people are not always on duty at the right times, in the right places and doing the right things.  The Garda roster introduced in 2012 has reduced the number of working days per member each year, the number of working hours per member each year and the number of members available for duty on any given day.  In total, approximately 83% of Garda resources are deployed to front-line services compared with approximately 93% in the other services we examined.  As far as we could see, garda&iacute; were not allocated according to policing needs.  An analysis of deployment data on a Tuesday morning and a Saturday night identified that there were 48 fewer people on duty on the Saturday night than on the Tuesday morning.  With an additional shift on the Saturday night to overlap, the inspectorate expected to see far more garda&iacute; on duty on the streets.<\/p> <p>  There is a two-tier community policing system within the organisation, with high numbers of garda&iacute; in the Dublin area but significantly fewer in other areas, particularly in rural Ireland.  At public meetings attended by the inspectorate and at which we conducted surveys of those present, community members reported noticing a reduction in Garda visibility in their communities.<\/p> <p>  The report touches on workforce modernisation and human resources.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs some functions that may be more appropriate to other agencies such as prosecuting District Court cases and the transportation of prisoners on remand.  In our estimate, at least 1,500 garda&iacute; are in non-operational roles that could be released for patrol, investigation and community policing duties.  At 14% of the total workforce, there is a low level of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na compared to other police services.<\/p><p>Most important, there is no individual performance management system for members.<\/p><p>  As for governance and culture, we found deficiencies in governance, accountability, leadership and what we call \"intrusive\" supervision.  The current Garda culture is inhibiting change.  While staff identified positives such as a \"can do\" culture and a sense of duty, many described the organisation as insular, defensive, with a blame culture where many leaders were reluctant to make decisions.  We identified some high-risk policing areas such as untrained garda drivers that needed to be addressed.  Many previous recommendations made in inspectorate reports and other Government-sponsored inquiries have not been fully implemented and their benefits have not been realised.  These findings are inhibiting the Garda from performing to its full potential.<\/p><p> There are 81 recommendations made in this report. of which 75% can be achieved, the inspectorate believes, at low or at cost.  Some of the key recommendations are a new leaner structure with fewer senior managers and more garda&iacute; on patrol, investigation and community policing duties; a reduction in the number of Garda regions from six to three, eliminating huge swathes of administration; development of multiple rosters tailored for specific Garda units to match the deployment of these resources to the days and times when they are most needed; the release of over 1,500 fully trained and experienced garda&iacute; from non-operational roles; the use of garda&iacute; to perform Garda roles and civilian staff to perform office and support roles; some national unit resources such as major investigation teams should be assigned to regions to provide a full national service as opposed to the Dublin-based service; the introduction of a new divisional policing model that breaks down non-physical barriers to efficient deployment; a reduction in the number of divisions to release even more garda&iacute; for patrol duties; the divestiture or outsourcing of functions that could be performed by other agencies; development of clear governance structures to ensure accountability and drive performance; creation of an environment where senior managers and other staff are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions to improve performance; the development of a strategy to improve the decision-making skills of leaders and supervisors and to ensure that they are well-trained and have the confidence to inspire staff, tackle underperformance and reward good work; and the introduction of a performance management system to encourage good performance and for continued underperformance to provide an ultimate sanction of dismissal.<\/p><p>The key outcomes from these recommendations will be an increased physical Garda presence to prevent crime and reassure and protect communities in rural areas, towns and cities; the creation of a new organisational structure that supports local policing; the development of a modern workforce with the right balance of members and support staff; and an improved Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, better for the public, victims of crime and members of the force themselves.  The Commissioner now has her top team in place; new garda&iacute; have joined and the Government has provided significant funding for crucial technology, new vehicles, new stations and refurbishments.  We see this as an opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to restructure and modernise.  The report has also been sent to the Policing Authority, the functions of which include the monitoring of implementation of reports of the inspectorate.<\/p><p> The inspectorate believes that if all of the recommendations made in the report are accepted, implemented and properly sequenced, this pathway for change will lead to a visible, accessible and responsive police service for all the people of Ireland.  We will gladly answer questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#AA00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert K.

At the start, people were quite defensive about some of our recommendations, but when we explained how they could work and how circumstances might be different, there was far more acceptance.  We have tried to engage management at all levels to persuade it and show that there are different ways of working.  Some reluctance was related to a fear of the unknown and different working practices.  We are recommending a change to the district structure which has been in place since the force was established.  It is a major change, but I have actually lived through it as a police officer.  Once we changed, none of my senior management team would have gone back to the old structure to work under it.  There is a fear of the unknown.  We know we need to explain the recommendations.  We are very keen to meet those concerned and talk through them.  We have done so in regard to crime, in the case of which things were starting to change following our report last year.  The more engagement we have, the more we can explain what we mean by a recommendation.  We should not just hand a report over; we need to work with management to help it to introduce something.  Some of this involves significant change, or a complete change in the way the force operates.  However, the structure is creaking and if management continues to try to operate under it, services, including 999 call services, will suffer, thereby affecting the public.  We are saying the time is right now.  The staff are in place and there is a senior management team.  The funding is in place for technology, which can be a major inhibitor.<\/p> <p>  It is very difficult to allocate staff unless one knows how busy one is and what one's demands are.  The force is still operating in some locations using paper-based systems.  Once the force has the technology in place and starts to allocate resources according to need and demand, a much better service will be delivered.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to provide a structure.  We have actually brought together what we believe to be a simple structure for a very complex organisation.  Clarity of role is important.  In respect of the structure, we found that units that started off with a particular function now carry out three or four others in addition.  Thus, they have lost the focus on their primary role.  The proposed structure is about putting them back into their primary role and getting them to focus on a distinct area of policing.  It is a question of getting other units to carry out the other functions that have been given to some of the national units, in particular.  It is a question of having clarity of role and functions.  When this is achieved, one can allocate resources appropriately.

Cyber-security is an issue, certainly, across the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.  There is no cyber-crime unit but that does not mean the Garda does not have skilled investigators.  There are some staff who are very skilled in forensic analysis of computers, laptops and technology, but what we recommend is that a specific unit be created and that these skills be developed so that they are ready for a growing number of cases.  Some of the cases are complex because part of the issue is in trying to work out the jurisdiction where the crime took place.  The computer crime investigation unit represents the Garda's forensic capacity in terms of cyber-crime at present, but just putting more people into that unit has not helped to deal with the backlog.  We have recommended - there is an acknowledgement that the Garda will probably accept this - that some of these resources be taken out of Dublin and put into a new Garda regional structure.  If an investigator in Kerry seizes some IT equipment and needs to have it examined forensically, it has to be driven all the way to Dublin to be examined, and that is a waste of everybody's time.  We suggest putting those resources much closer to the investigators, taking them out to operations and not bringing in as much technological equipment as they are seizing at present.<\/p><p>Currently investigators have a dilemma when they go to an address.  They think it better to seize equipment just in case it contains evidence.  If we took some of the specialist units out on those sorts of operations, they would not be seizing the level of equipment seized at the moment.  When we examined it, there was a four year backlog and some of the cases were dismissed in court for abuse of process because of the time taken, which is unsatisfactory for everyone concerned.  <\/p><p> Other jurisdictions are putting their cyber-crime capacity into their serious and organised crime units.

I think everyone can accept that if they were driving without endangering the public, the points should be cancelled.  However, I have a concern.  Would the exemption be applied to a garda who is late attending a meeting?  How far is the statutory exemption stretched?  It cannot be turned into a farce.

If a garda is on duty and driving a Garda car, I would expect the garda to notify any control room if he or she is driving at an excessive speed or trying to catch up with a vehicle.  That should all be recorded by the control room and a supervisor should take care of it in that regard.  There is tracking technology in Garda cars but it is not switched on in all of them.  The tracking system will tell us how the car is being driven, the speed at which it is being driven and where it was at a particular time.  We are saying that technology should be switched on immediately.  It is much better for vehicle deployments but South Wales have also found it reduced collisions involving police officers by 50%.  Another police service referred to in the report found that its level of vehicle repairs reduced by 20%.  I was a police driver myself.  When we know we are being monitored, we will drive at a higher standard.  The technology is fantastic and available and should be switched on.<\/p> <p>  The concept of \"off duty\", where police officers decide they will place themselves on duty because they have seen something, is far more difficult a concept but it is still possible to check CCTV and a senior officer should investigate the circumstances.  I would expect an off-duty member to inform a control room and a supervisor immediately on doing something.  Ideally the member would have the registration number of the car or details relating to what they have done but this has to be examined to ensure a garda is treated the same way another member of the public would be treated.

I feel strongly and passionately that the implementation of its report will result in two key things.  First, it will save lives and, second, it will save a lot of money.  In the report, the inspectorate says that 75% of its work is low cost or cost neutral work.  I wanted to note that much and say that I genuinely feel passionately about the issues raised.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the deployment of resources.  This made my blood boil because I have been speaking about this issue for the past ten years in the Oireachtas justice committee.  People are not always on duty at the right time or in the right places nor are they doing the right things.  We need to deal with the Saturday night-Tuesday morning syndrome.  It was said that 48 fewer people were on duty on a Saturday night.  Most people know that most anti-social behaviour takes place outside pubs, chip shops and social clubs between midnight and 3 o'clock on a Saturday night, Sunday morning.  I am fuming that when the report was carried out, 48 fewer people were on duty on the Saturday night.  A higher number of people were on duty on a Tuesday morning, when practically nothing happens.  Why is this happening?  Does it have to take a Garda inspectorate to see it?  Young garda&iacute; in my constituency have been saying this to me for the past ten years.  They tell me that if a garda or two were sent up to stand at the local chippers between 12 midnight and 2 o'clock on a Saturday night, anti-social behaviour would be reduced by 60% or 70%.  Why is this still happening?  I call it the Saturday night-Tuesday morning syndrome.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#EE00700","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I will turn this over to Mr. Toland but what we did was carry out a snapshot in time.

Olson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The first thing one needs to do is to make sure one's people are in the right place.  We are recommending that they take a critical look at where every Garda member is positioned at the moment if they are not in an operational role.  Do they need to be in that role?  We found roles that should be performed by Garda support staff.  We found sergeants in roles a garda could do, so there is an issue regarding whether it needs police sworn powers and whether it needs to be done by a sergeant or inspector or whether it could be done by a garda.  That is the first thing.<\/p> <p>  Second, if one is going to allocate resources across the country, one needs to have a scientific method of allocating those resources.  At the moment, we are not convinced people are allocated according to policing needs.  If we went to Tipperary, as part of this exercise, and looked in detail at the way it deals with calls from the public, we would find they are recording these on paper systems.  Asking Tipperary for this data around deployment took so much longer than the other divisions we looked at, such as Cork city and a division in Dublin.  They were able to press a button and give us the details of all the calls they dealt with.  If people are not allocated according to need, it means places that have an older workforce where people are retiring and where numbers are lost are disproportionately losing people because they are being promoted or are going to other places.  We are not convinced that people are assigned and allocated according to the needs of those policing areas.  It is a major issue.  There will be people who will gain from this process and those who could lose from it because one runs a process about allocation, some people will have too many and some will not have enough.  We are suggesting that they introduce a system of determining demand and then allocating resources.  We think we need to build the organisation from a division upwards.  It involves looking at what the demands around 999 calls are, how many people are being arrested and what the local demands are and building resources around that demand, building up to the regions and then building up to headquarters because they are in place to support the delivery of local policing services.  <\/p> <p>  We were quite shocked by some of the results, particularly around the number of full-time community garda&iacute; allocated across Ireland.  The numbers were very low while the numbers in Dublin were huge.  There are 540 full-time community garda&iacute; across Ireland, 328 of which are in the six Dublin divisions.  A total of 117 of those are in one division in Dublin, so one Dublin city centre division has 117 community officers.  Limerick has 50, Cork city has 27 and Waterford has 20.  When one starts to add those up, one can see that most of the resources are in the cities.  When one looks at the rural communities, one will find that there are 14 divisions with ten or fewer community garda&iacute; covering 365 days a year, 24\/7.   Two divisions - Kildare and Mayo - do not have full-time community garda&iacute;.  This is what the public is noticing because they are the people known to the community, the people the public contact and the people who go to community meetings.  We ran this process.  It had not been done before.  This is something that should be run on a quarterly basis because as an organisation, one needs to know at 11 a.m. that if a major incident happens, one has the right number of people on duty with the right skills.  It is not about numbers.  One needs to have a certain number of detectives or traffic officers on duty at certain times, so it is good practice to do this.  It is a snapshot in time.  We can only say this is what we found when we ran these.  <\/p> <p>  Another worrying thing was the number of Garda reserves.  There are 1,124 Garda reserves but on that Saturday night across Ireland, only 34 were on duty at 11. p.m.  That is a time when one would expect to see to them.  We have met the Garda reserves.  They are good people but again, they are not being used to the best of their ability.  They provide a physical presence.  We want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to become an organisation that prevents crime.  It involves getting out there and having a uniformed presence to try to stop the crime from happening because that will reduce demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#FF00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland"},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Mr. Toland talked about 83% of Garda resources being deployed to front-line services compared to 93% in other jurisdictions.

It would be things like garda&iacute; on patrol, detectives dealing with victims of crime, those at front counters, call takers who are speaking to the public and the victims' officers because policing is not just about people on patrol.  It is about those front-line services.  Most of the police services we visited have really looked at stripping back the back office support and the number of senior managers and trying to get more people into those front-line services.  We are saying they should be Garda members and support staff.  Some 10% is a significant percentage when one looks at the workforce.  The number was 12,804 which is a significant number of members who we think should go back on to the front line.  We compared a previous inspectorate report to see if there had been any difference.  There has very little difference in protecting the front line when we looked at these numbers in 2010.

We certainly believe the district structure means that districts in the same division - sometimes there can be four, five or six districts in a division - make decisions on whether people have the night off and what duties they do without someone taking a divisional look to ensure there are sufficient people on duty across the division instead of in 96 districts.  What we found on the Saturday night was that a greater proportion of people were due to come on duty but were actually not at work.  This was a significant number of people with authorised absence.  We recommend examining why 1,300 people did not come on duty across Ireland that night.

It is clear that some of this would be at no cost, or a relatively low cost, and there is a desire for it.  As far as I recall, that meeting with the Commissioner took place approximately 12 months ago.  Has there been, in the inspectorate's view, and based on this report, a significant change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the past 12 months in terms of implementing this new approach to the professionalisation of certain roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  It was mentioned that the report is a snapshot in time, but 12 months ago, when the Commissioner was before the committee, issues were identified with regard to bringing in individuals with specific expertise who do not need to be sworn members.

During the course of the discussion it was stated that approximately 53% of Garda vehicles are unmarked.  Apparently, a larger percentage of the new vehicles deployed this year are unmarked.  Therefore, it stands to reason that the figure of 53% is increasing.  My question on the observation from the public meeting is how is it determined whether there is or is not a reduction in the Garda presence.  Is it simply a matter of visibility and that the public is not necessarily seeing the garda&iacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#HH01400","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I went to most of those meetings.  The public was very supportive, and feedback on community policing garda&iacute; was absolutely fantastic, but people have noticed that the number of community garda&iacute; has decreased.  Most of the people at the meetings represent areas, organisations and neighbourhood watch groups.  These are people in regular contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a formal environment.  They get text alerts and information.  They have noticed a reduction in the number of community policing garda&iacute; and this is how they gauged it.  This was the case in every meeting we attended.  People love their community policing garda&iacute;, but they have noticed that they do not see them.  Many people on the outskirts of a district or division said they felt there was not as much visibility of garda&iacute;, which is what the Deputy is speaking about.<\/p> <p>  We included recommendations in the report, some of which are quite simple.  Sometimes police officers walk up and down a street, but unless they knock on a few doors and engage people they are not seen.  It could well be that garda&iacute; are out on patrol, but they need to get out of their cars and engage people and let them know they are there.  Otherwise, people do not always see them.  Sometimes this is unfair because they are out there patrolling.  If they are in the police cars driving up and down roads, quite often those in the community do not see them, but if they knock on two or three doors and let people know they are there, and pop into a business and let the business know they are about, it resonates with people.  My police officers in London in my last command were quite shy, with their heads down.  Part of what we did was to tell them to have their heads up and talk to people.  People will remember that engagement, whereas if the police officers walk past them they will not remember it as an engagement.  There is something about communication skills and basic people skills, and letting people know they are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#HH01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450258200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It is important to recognise there has been an increase in the number of marked cars, and we noted this in the report.

That said, we stated in the report that the inspectorate does not believe there is a need for certain cars which are unmarked at present to be unmarked.

I get quite a lot of complaints from constituents on this issue.  Gridlock is back in Dublin city and it is sometimes quite severe.  A couple of weeks ago, a traffic accident occurred on the M50 and the entire M50 and the north side of the city were in gridlock for a couple of hours.  I was coming into the city that morning and at Fairview, where there is a junction of three roads, the traffic was stopped and motorists were trying to drive through red lights and yellow boxes.  There was mayhem but there was not a garda to be seen anywhere.  In situations like that, somebody is needed on the ground to stop people from behaving in this manner.  It would be expected in such situations that one or two garda&iacute; would be at that junction.<\/p> <p>  This is not the only sort of complaint I have heard.  I have heard complaints about traffic congestion and parking and so on.  We have others, not just the Garda traffic corps, to deal with these issues.

The traffic corps has seen a significant reduction in the number of garda&iacute; assigned to traffic duties, as have community policing units seen such a reduction.

We recommend that the divisional model considers how these people are deployed.<\/p> <p>  Currently, people from other units deal with serious car accidents where people are injured.  I believe traffic officers should deal with the most serious accidents.  Motorways are probably the most dangerous places for police officers to operate on.  Those police officers should be properly trained traffic officers.  The report considers this issue.

We receive many written submissions from victims and their families which we take seriously.  They would also affect any decision we reach.  In any decision the board makes, we must bear in mind it is correct for the protection of society.<\/p> <p>  I have been privileged to be chairman of the Parole Board for the past four years.  There is incredibly good work being done under the radar by all the staff in the Prison Service, the Probation Service and the psychology and educational services.  Obviously, there are a few bad apples.  However, by and large, from my experience, we see very vulnerable prisoners being treated exceptionally by staff.  That is the positive story but there are negative ones too.<\/p> <p>  I have great admiration for Peter McVerry.  He recently said that not one prisoner has been improved in prison.  I have to contradict him, however.  Ironically, we mainly deal with lifers.  As they are in for a minimum of 15 years, there is time given to let them rehabilitate themselves.  We have seen very dangerous and vulnerable people completely rehabilitated over 15 to 20 years.  Unfortunately, there are some who it will be impossible to rehabilitate and who will always be a danger to society.<\/p> <p>  When we visit prisoners, we make three key points to them.  First, they have to serve their punishment; second, they must rehabilitate themselves; third, they have to be low risk for reoffending.  The big philosophical debate we come across in practice is about when someone has served their punishment.  Sometimes, there is a conflict between the rehabilitation of a prisoner and the serving of his or her sentence or punishment.  When Michael Donnellan, director general of the Prison Service, attended our training day, he made the point that the length of time a person is in prison should not be the most important factor when it comes to rehabilitation.  In other words, quite often, there is an appropriate time for someone to be granted periods of temporary release or to be moved to an open prison.  There is no doubt that prisoners for life can become institutionalised.  If they are imprisoned for too long, it may be too late to rehabilitate them fully and settle them back into the community.<\/p> <p>  The Parole Board only deals with a small number of prisoners.  Only 344 life-sentence prisoners come under our jurisdiction while only 273 prisoners serve a sentence of ten years or more.  On balance, we might only recommend parole for four or five prisoners a year.  At least 70 former life-sentence prisoners are out in the community who have not reoffended.  That is a sign parole is working.  On average, only one life-sentence prisoner comes back into prison during the year.<\/p> <p>  We compiled statistics in 2013 which showed that only 24% of prisoners who were accused of murder pleaded guilty in the courts.  However, in prison, when they were found guilty of murder, over 90% admitted their guilt.  They had no incentive to plead guilty in the courts.  This needs to be dealt with and I have suggested a reform.  If a person pleads guilty, there is no mention in the appropriate legislation that this factor should be taken into account when considering parole.  It is a major omission.  If it could affect their parole decisions, it would incentivise more people accused of murder to plead guilty.<\/p> <p>  The Parole Board deals with many fixed-term sentence prisoners, say of ten years or more.  They get an automatic 25% remission.  For example, a prisoner sentenced to ten years gets out after seven and a half years.  Quite often a number of these prisoners are going to reoffend because there are no post-release supervision orders.  There is an onus on the Judiciary to make more post-release supervision orders because the Probation Service does not have any requirement to help these offenders.  There is a role for the Judiciary to improve.  I read recently that a private firm in the UK helped the post-release supervision of prisoners.<\/p><p>That firm was paid on the basis of results.  In other words, if former prisoners did not reoffend, the private firm got paid.  I do not know how it worked out but it was a very interesting idea.  The incentive was they got paid if the offenders did not reoffend.  It is interesting that we do not have an open prison for women.  There is no training of board members but I have gone back to college and studied for an MA in criminology.  One of the issues we looked at was private prisons.  In Australia, 20% of prisons are private and those prisons have strict values to which they must adhere.  It occurs to me that an open prison for women could be constructed privately on the Australian model.  I throw that suggestion out.<\/p><p> My final point is totally irrelevant but refers to something that could have changed the face of history.  In the American presidential election of 2000, George Bush won in Florida by 537 votes.  If the prisoners of Florida had had a vote, they would have voted Democrat and George Bush would have lost the election.  World history would have changed.  I end on that note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015121600002#KK00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450258200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>That is a very interesting note on which to end.  I thank Mr. Costello for coming in to us.  He has raised a significant number of issues in his report and submission.  I apologise but I have to be up in the Chamber shortly and cannot stay long.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Mr Costello on private prisons.  If one looks at the literature and experience of private prisons in the UK and US in particular, they have not been a happy experience.  The problem is that the number of people in them tends to expand as prison places become available.  This committee has produced a report suggesting there should be a lower use of imprisonment and that prison should be a last resort.  I do not agree it is a good road to go down, although I agree with Mr Costello that we should have an open prison facility for women.<\/p> <p>  On a more serious note, Mr Costello spoke about the issue of the guilty plea as a factor when reviewing a prisoner for parole and said it is not currently a factor the Parole Board can consider when reviewing a prisoner for parole.

This is to empower the National Transport Authority, NTA, to make by-laws in respect of public transport passenger services which will be tendered to commence operations in late 2016 or early 2017.  In the event that incumbent operators do not win the tender it is necessary for the NTA to have powers to make by-laws in respect of public services to be provided by new operators.  Coras Iompar &Eacute;ireann, CIE, has statutory powers to make the equivalent by-laws to regulate the public transport passenger services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The proposed new section 56A sets out the standard range of operational activities in respect of which the by-laws may be applied.  Section 56B is to provide for the appointment by the NTA of authorised persons to ensure the users of the public transport services comply with the section 56A by-laws.  The new section 56C sets out the powers of the authorised persons who have been appointed under section 56B, while the new section 56D is an enforcement measure to provide that authorised persons may serve fixed charge notices in respect of alleged offences and sets out the procedural aspects of the fixed charge processes. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 is to require that notification of the making of by-laws for Luas passenger services and copies of draft and final by-laws be published online.  The proposed amendment will be inserted as section 5 into the Bill.  This is in line with what is being proposed for the NTA in the Bill. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 11 is to expand the Long Title and consequential on the updating of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 in amendment No. 7. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#D00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450269000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450269000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450269000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#D00600","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:&ldquo;(g) in section 10, by inserting the following subsections after subsection (2):<blockquote>&ldquo;(3) Subsection (2) shall be operated with due consideration for the principles set down by the Good Friday Agreement 1998 in respect of placing no undue barriers to employment against people with previous convictions arising out of the conflict referred to in the Agreement and that Schedule 1 or 2 shall not apply in these cases.<br \/><br \/>(4) A licensing authority shall not grant a licence under section 9 to a person unless it is satisfied that he or she is not engaged in full-time employment in any other occupation and plans to continue this work during the operation of the licence.&rdquo;,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>I have raised this issue several times.

The Deputy tabled similar amendments during the passage of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the proposed dispensation for those convicted of offences covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, it was pointed out at the time that it was not appropriate to specify such inclusion in the context of the proposed legislation.  Section 10 of the 2013 Act provides for the consideration of such offences among the matters to be included in the assessment of the suitability of a licence applicant and licence holder.  Sections 30 and 31 of the Act provide for mandatory disqualification on conviction for specified offences and an obligation to notify conviction for these offences to the licensing authority.  In the case of the most serious indictable offences specified under section 30(2) of the Act, the disqualification applies whether the person has been convicted before or after commencement of the subsection. <\/p> <p>  The specification of offences to which mandatory disqualification applies is based on the principle of ensuring the welfare and safety of passengers.  Nevertheless, because of the restriction this places on the possibility of persons&rsquo; participation in the industry, the grounds for mandatory disqualification were, for legal reasons, narrowly defined.  It is not possible in legislation to seek to further redefine instances where there may be mitigating circumstances.  The mandatory disqualification provision, therefore, relies on specified offences which relate to specific violent activities, rather than a focus on any specific type or group of people.  That is why the 2013 Act makes specific provision for an appeal to the courts in respect of mandatory disqualification such that exceptions are possible where the courts determine they are appropriate.  The courts are positioned to make that judgment.  We have exchanged views on this issue on several occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#D00800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We are well over 15 years into the Good Friday Agreement.

The first is to amend subsection (2)(b) to insert the words &quot;a copy of the notice&quot;.  The purpose of the amendment is to avoid the issue of multiple fixed payment notices in respect of the same incident.  The relevant Act currently requires that when a fixed payment notice is affixed to a parked vehicle, a fixed payment notice must be subsequently sent to the person who is the registered owner of the vehicle.  The amendment is to avoid potential confusion and duplication in enforcement administration by clarifying that a copy of the original notice affixed to a vehicle should subsequently be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle.<\/p><p>The second amendment is to subsection (3)(b) and provides for an extension of the time period during which a fixed payment notice can be paid from 21 days to 28.

This failure to ratify has led to infringement proceedings being taken against Ireland by the European Commission.  As a result and following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I have decided that Ireland should expedite the ratification of the convention by means of primary legislation.  Irish Rail has been fully consulted on the matter.  Enactment of legislation in this area is unlikely to have any significant practical impact on rail operators or rail passengers in the State as the majority of the provisions of the convention were already covered by terms and conditions of contracts or provided for by EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015121600002#E02600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450269000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I have concerns about whether this could put pressure on the sector to privatise.

I made it very clear that owing to the way the Irish rail market was organised, its size and geographical isolation, I did not believe it was appropriate to introduce mandatory tendering for the entire market in Ireland.  This was reflected in the decision of the Council, which is now subject to negotiation and discussion in the European Parliament.
