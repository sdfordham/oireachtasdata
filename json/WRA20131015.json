However, on hearing of his detention, and notwithstanding the fact that he is not a citizen of Ireland, the Irish Embassy in Athens made contact with the Greek police in an effort to convey the Irish Government's interest in this case on the basis that he is married to an Irish citizen. It was made clear to our Embassy that the authorities in Crete would not provide them with any information regarding this case as no Irish citizen was involved. To clarify further, our Embassy has certain rights of communication and contact with Irish citizens in Greece to facilitate the exercise of our consular functions under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963). The Embassy has no such rights for other persons, even if they are related to Irish citizens.   The wife of the person concerned has met with the former Minister of State in my Department.

The January 2010 earthquake killed more than 230,000 people, injured 300,000 others, and left 2.1 million homeless. Even before the spread of the epidemic, the health, water and sanitation infrastructure had been severely affected. The cholera epidemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 8,300 people and infected more than 650,000 people.  Recurrent outbreaks since then have resulted in the deaths of some 1,000 Haitians each year.  In response to allegations in December 2010 that the initial outbreak was linked to the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the Secretary-General of the United Nations formed an Independent Panel to &lsquo;&lsquo;investigate and seek to determine the source of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti&rsquo;&rsquo;. The investigation involved epidemiological, water and sanitation, and molecular analyses. The final report concluded that the investigation did &lsquo;&lsquo;not present any conclusive scientific evidence linking the outbreak to the MINUSTAH peacekeepers&rsquo;&rsquo;.  Whatever its source, it is clear that the cholera outbreak represents a further tragedy for the Haitian people.  I am aware that a class action lawsuit has recently been filed against the United Nations on behalf of victims of the cholera epidemic.  We will continue to follow developments.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, Ireland&rsquo;s response to humanitarian needs in the country has been significant and sustained. Since 2010, the Government has provided more than &euro;14 million in funding for emergency relief in Haiti.  Our funding has focused on the most vulnerable populations affected as well as the most pressing needs, such as emergency shelter and reconstruction. More than &euro;2 million of this emergency funding was provided by Irish Aid to agencies involved in the fight against cholera.  This year, we have provided &euro;500,000 in funding to Goal in support of its programme to fight community vulnerability to disease outbreaks in Haiti, including cholera. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Certificate of Irish Heritage","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[43384\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of persons that have been awarded a certificate of Irish Heritage in the years 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>Since the Certificate of Irish Heritage was introduced in September 2011, 2,123 Certificates have been purchased &ndash; 124 in 2011, 1,242 in 2012 and 757 to date in 2013.

The policy includes a clear commitment to accountability and transparency, to the Irish people and to our development partners in what we do, how we work, and what we are achieving.  It states clearly that we will also work with our partners - Governments, NGOs, multilateral organisations and others - to ensure that they adhere to similar standards of accountability and transparency. In this way, Irish people will be better able to see where and how their money is being spent and what results are being achieved. Ireland is a strong supporter of multilateral development efforts, recognising that global challenges need global solutions.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the IMF. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, works closely with the World Bank, in cooperation with the Department of Finance.  The World Bank Group supports developing countries in their fight against poverty by providing the financial and technical assistance needed to promote trade and investment. As outlined in the reply to the Question referred to, Irish Aid provided some &euro;27.8 million in funding to World Bank-managed trust funds in 2012 for work in developing countries.  The funding was provided to programmes focused on the fight against hunger, the provision of basic needs, private sector development, and fragile and conflict- affected states.  Full details of all the programmes supported by Ireland, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Finance, are available in the annual report by the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the IMF and the World Bank.   Ireland, the IMF and the World Bank, cooperate in the international work to ensure the effectiveness of development aid, as set out clearly in the agreement reached two years ago on the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation in 2011.  This emphasises the importance of empowering countries to drive their own development, on the basis of the principle of partnership and of mutual accountability. <\/p><p>  In our engagement with the Executive Board of the World Bank Group, Ireland participates in the work to ensure increased effectiveness and better results for people living in poverty. Ireland is also an active participant in the work of the Multilateral Organisation Performance Network, a grouping of 17 donor countries, which carries out joint assessments of the effectiveness of multilateral organisations which deliver international development programmes.  These assessments are published online. Both the IMF and the World Bank are engaged in ongoing processes of governance reform, which Ireland strongly supports.  We will continue to work to ensure that the IMF and World Bank meet the required standards of accountability and transparency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Remit","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[43528\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500059#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will engage on a political level with his political counterpart in Greece in relation to a person (details supplied); if he will speak to the Greek Ambassador to Ireland; the formal steps he will take to raise the concerns of the Irish family involved in this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Having considered the options available, the then Government introduced the early child care supplement, providing a direct payment to all families with young children. In addition, certain other incentives were introduced in order to encourage an increase in the supply of child care places.  At that time, tax relief for child care costs was considered but not introduced, as it would only have been of benefit to those in the tax net and would most likely have been absorbed by child care providers in the form of higher prices.  Analysis showed that a standard rated child care costs allowance of &euro;4,000 per annum would cost the Exchequer &euro;64 million per annum and would have resulted in a reduced liability to income tax of only &euro;15 per week for those availing of it.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the early child care supplement has since been abolished as the measure was very costly, poorly targeted and possibly led to increased charges.  In its stead, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides for a free preschool year for children in the year before commencing primary school, was introduced.  In my view the concerns raised in the 2005 analysis regarding tax relief for child care costs are still valid.  This is particularly the case considering the major changes in the economy that have occurred in the intervening period.  Furthermore, I would have concerns about basing any analysis of the cost of making child care tax deductible on data provided in reports that were compiled eight years ago.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the absence of tax relief for child care costs, the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  For this reason a number of support measures are available.  These include, (i) the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community child care services to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to qualifying parents, (ii) the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides free child care places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and (iii) the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free preschool year for children in the year before commencing primary school.

I am informed by Revenue that, as LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on an assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners were not required to provide a precise value for their property as at 1 May 2013, it is anticipated that, for the most part, overpayments of LPT should not happen.  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016.  I am also informed that the Revenue estimates, which issued to property owners with the LPT 1 Return were not based on a valuation of properties and should not be regarded as a calculation of the amount of LPT due.  The estimate only comes into play where a property owner does not submit a Return or contact Revenue to say why he\/she is not liable.<\/p><p>  On the specific case to which the Deputy refers, I am informed by Revenue that the person in question submitted her LPT 1 Return on 8 April 2013 and clearly indicated Band 4 as the appropriate valuation band for her property.  The LPT liability for the 2013 half year for a Band 4 property is &euro;202 and the person in question is meeting her obligations on a phased basis through one of the payment service providers.  Notwithstanding the expectation that in general overpayments of LPT should not happen, Revenue has confirmed to me that if a liable person has genuinely overpaid the tax through an error or mistake, then Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the overpayment can be made to Revenue.  If that is the case for the person in question, she should write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Ennis, Co Clare, clearly setting out how the overpayment happened.  The person will need to also provide supporting documentation to explain or prove the need to decrease her original valuation. Once the relevant documentation is received LPT Branch will make direct contact with the person.  Should it transpire that the person did in fact overpay the 2013 liability then it will be possible to offset some or all of the overpayment to the 2014 liability or make a repayment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500060#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500060#WRB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[43377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500060#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason Revenue has backdated tax in respect of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person (details supplied) contacted his local Revenue office in January 2012 and his agent subsequently completed a tax return for the tax year 2011.

Further to this, the CSO website shows a 13% increase in employment from June 2011 to June 2013 in the food and accommodations services sector.<\/p><p>The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, among which there are a number of measures aimed at retraining the workforce.  While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., I would ask the Deputy to note that my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000.  Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.<\/p><p>Under education measures, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places.  During 2011 and 2012 over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme.  The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation.  Further rollouts of the Springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation.<\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that it will only be when the levy has ended and the accompanying expenditure and revenue measures have also ceased that it will be possible to analyse the situation.  At any given point before then, it would not be surprising if the income and expenditure did not match.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500061#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500061#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[43648\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500061#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total amount paid by the State to Ernst and Young, and Grant Thornton since 2008.

In considering applications for teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <\/p><p>  Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support.  The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  The NCSE circular 03\/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>  All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment.<\/p><p>  I understand a meeting has recently taken place between school management and the psychologist assigned to this school.  <\/p><p>  It is my understanding that the pupil in question currently has access to SNA support.  It is open to schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the coming school year.

The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.

Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance.  In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. <\/p><p>  The extent of supports required for any child in a particular class setting or school will depend on their disability categorisation and the extent of care needs that they may have.  As such, schools have access to a full range of supports to facilitate the enrolment of pupils with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  In order to meet any late demand for resource teaching support which may have arisen between 15th March, 2013 and the start of the school year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) requested all schools to submit outstanding applications for resource teaching support to the NCSE by 20th September, 2013.  The NCSE intend to notify schools of any revised resource teaching allocations in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  In relation to SNA support, schools should contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the coming school year.  In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school. <\/p><p>  I understand that the school concerned have made an application to the NCSE for resource teaching support for this child and that they also intend to make an application in respect of SNA support.  Where a school has applied to the NCSE for additional resource teaching or SNA resources, the school should provide for the child from within their existing allocations, pending consideration of any application.<\/p><p>  In circumstances where a child has been suspended or expelled, Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. <\/p><p>  In such circumstances the parent of the child concerned may lodge a Section 29 appeal against the decision of the school to expel or suspend and to have this case heard by an independent appeal panel. <\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisations representing school management at primary level.

I have no powers to regulate the textbook market, as suggested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level. I agree with the Deputy that schools should seriously consider the cost of textbooks when deciding which ones to use. I have encouraged schools to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last.<\/p><p>  These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.<\/p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines followed a survey of schools conducted in 2011 by the Department. This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%. Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.<\/p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them. If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.<\/p><p>  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.

In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement process, the National Procurement Service as part of the new Office of Government Procurement is promoting standardisation and simplification of the public procurement function.  It has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which will help both businesses and buyers to reduce administrative costs.<\/p><p>The National Procurement Service is focussed on positive measures aimed at ensuring that SMEs are able to take full advantage of the public procurement opportunities that arise and are available to them. For example the NPS facilitate seminars for SMEs which cover all the issues relating to competing for public procurement contracts, including: Public Procurement regulations, accessing the market opportunities, the tendering process and general guidance on how companies should approach the preparation of tender. A number of seminars were also delivered to ISME and to Chambers of Commerce. Workshops were also delivered on public procurement opportunities in association with Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland. The NPS has also produced a leaflet &quot;Top Tendering Tips for Public Sector Contracts&quot; which is freely available.<\/p><p>In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500064#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500065#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[43457\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500065#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the discussions between the Office of Public Works and the Insurance Federation of Ireland on insurance for homes that flood or are risk of flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works does not have any function or powers in relation to the regulation of the insurance market in Ireland.

The study focussed on data collected from twenty-seven EU Member States and covers the two-year period 2008 to 2010.<\/p><p>  The study found that about 40% of total economic activity in the EU amounting to some &euro;4.7 trillion annually is generated by industries that are referred to as being  IPR-intensive in the sense that they are significant users of Intellectual Property rights to support their economic activity.  Furthermore, it was found that approximately 35% of all employment in the EU (77 million jobs) stems from industries that have a higher than average use of Intellectual Property rights.  <\/p><p>  While my officials have not had the opportunity to consider the study in detail, it is seen as providing important data that will underpin and inform evidence-based policy making in the area of Intellectual Property.  It appears also to establish a clear link between the use of Intellectual Property rights and stimulating innovation and creativity leading ultimately to job creation.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s rating in the study is very favourable. Ireland rates first in terms of GDP share in all IPR-intensive industries in the EU, first for GDP share of copyright-intensive industries and, first for GDP share of trade mark-intensive industries.  Ireland performs well also in relation to other rankings, positioned third in the EU for GDP share of patent-intensive industries and above average employment share in copyright-intensive industries. Ireland has the highest percentage of IP-intensive employment from industries based outside the European Union.  This can be attributed to the level of high quality foreign direct investment that we have successfully attracted to locate here.<\/p><p>  This Government has focussed on ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s Intellectual Property regime compares favourably with best international practice.  The Action Plan for Jobs has targeted enhancements in Ireland&rsquo;s IP regime as intrinsic to establishing high-quality employment in Ireland.  New protocols for managing IP from collaborative research in research institutions and promoting Ireland as an IP jurisdiction in the context of financial services all play their part.  <\/p><p>  During the Irish EU Presidency, an agreement to establish a Unified Patent Court was signed in February 2013 which, when established alongside the EU unitary patent system, will help to streamline patenting in Europe making it more affordable to secure and enforce patent rights in Europe.  This is particularly important for small and medium sized enterprises.<\/p><p>  A report by the Copyright Review Committee set up in 2011 to examine the existing Copyright regime and to specifically examine whether it presents any barriers to innovation is expected to be published shortly.  I will be reviewing this with interest to consider and examine if modifications to the copyright regime are required.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500065#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-US Trade","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500065#WRG02800"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[43057\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500065#WRG02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the current state of negotiations of a transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the EU and US; his views on whether the partnership should include clauses empowering EU and US based companies to take private legal cases directly against Governments at international tribunals where they find that national laws in areas such as public health, environmental and social protection infringe their right to business; the implications of such a clause for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>Negotiations between the EU and the US on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) began formally in July, with the first round of negotiations held in Washington in the week beginning 8th   July 2013.

","asker":"996","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>On 1 October last, I published the Report of the Labour Court&rsquo;s Review of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system. The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.<\/p><p>  The usual practice in JLCs in terms of convening meetings is for the worker representatives to seek a meeting to review pay and conditions of employment in terms of the remit of the particular JLC. The Labour Court report noted that, prior to 2011 when the existing JLCs were suspended, there were no meetings of the JLC for hotels in Dublin. This implied that for 14 years there had been no requirement for a JLC for Dublin or related Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) to provide protection for workers in hotels in the Dublin area. In effect, there has never been a operational JLC for hotels in Dublin.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, as the JLC for Dublin and Dun Laoghaire hotels was never active, the Labour Court concluded that there was no demand for such in Dublin, (or in the County Borough of Cork, which has never been encompassed by a hotel JLC), and therefore it should be abolished<\/p><p>  The Hotels (Other excluding Cork) JLC is to be retained, with an amended ERO to provide clarity as to what employees it applies to.<\/p><p>  The amended Establishment Order for a Hotels JLC will take account of hotel employees that work in leisure facilities and those employed by the hotel or a related business engaged in the provision of personal services such as health, and beautician services provided on the premises to customers of the hotel, as well as &lsquo;outdoor grounds workers&rsquo; and is aimed at reflecting a more accurate picture of the services hotels offer today.<\/p><p>  This amendment provides clarity to who is covered by the JLC and removes the &lsquo;incidental&rsquo; wording previously used to encompass hotel employees who worked in the range of services provided by hotels.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Labour Court sits very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in an area of industrial relations and wage setting whose objective is balancing improvement in Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. <\/p><p>  The Industrial Relations Act, 2012, was very much part of the process of reform and introduced flexibility for employers in the context of JLCs and Establishment Orders and set specific parameters within which JLCs can operate. <\/p><p>  For example, in proposing EROs that will give general effect to JLC proposals, the Labour Court must have regard to the legitimate interests of employers and workers, including:<\/p><p>  - the financial and commercial interests of the employers,<\/p><p>  - the desirability of agreeing and maintaining efficient and sustainable work practices,<\/p><p>  - the desirability of maintaining competitiveness,<\/p><p>  - the desirability of agreeing and maintaining fair and sustainable minimum rates of remuneration appropriate to the sector,<\/p><p>  - the levels of employment and unemployment in the sector in question,<\/p><p>  - the general level of wages in comparable sectors, and<\/p><p>  - The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, and the appropriateness of fixing a higher statutory minimum hourly rate of pay.<\/p><p>  The Act also made provision to introduce enhanced flexibility for employers to enable them respond to changing economic circumstances in that companies are able to derogate from EROs in cases of financial difficulty. The scope of JLCs has been narrowed in that JLCs no longer set conditions of employment covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation. In particular they will not set Sunday premium rates. In addition, record-keeping requirements for employers in the sectors covered by JLCs have been reduced.<\/p><p>  It is important to remember that the JLC Establishment Orders envisaged will provide only a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation. Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.<\/p><p>  In addition, a key element of the reforms provided for in the Act is the introduction of provisions to ensure comprehensive Oireachtas and Ministerial oversight of the JLC system.<\/p><p>  This process sits very much within the context of Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[43565\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will remove the condition in the Consolidated Companies Act 2012 whereby small and medium businesses are subject to a compulsory audit for late filing of returns and instead apply a financial penalty, thereby removing the risk of significant costs to the business for accountants and auditors while simultaneously removing the risk of auditors-accountants being unable to recoup their fees.

Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p>  - The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700;<\/p><p>  - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register; <\/p><p>  With regard to the expected impact of policy, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register. <\/p><p>  Specifically, these targets include:<\/p><p>  1. At least 75,000 of those who were long-term unemployed in early 2012 will move into employment by 2015<\/p><p>  2. Increase the exit rate of people on the Live Register for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015<\/p><p>  3. Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed) to 25%.<\/p><p>  As almost 2 out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. <\/p><p>  The most recent statistics available from the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey shows the level of youth unemployment has fallen from an average of 75,000 in 2010 to 63,000 in the most recent twelve months for which data are available. The level of employment of young people appears to have stabilised, and indeed the employment rate (proportion of the population with jobs) for those aged 20-24 years rose from 46.5% in mid-2012 to 49% in the second quarter of this year.<\/p><p>  Looking forward, in addition to current initiatives, policies to increase youth employment will be supplemented by additional measures under the Youth Guarantee which will be rolled out in 2014.<\/p><p>  While the Recommendation for an EU-wide Youth Guarantee Scheme was adopted during the Irish Presidency earlier this year, the implementation of the scheme across the EU has yet to begin.  It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State.  At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented. <\/p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has set up an interdepartmental group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs,  to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee. The Department of Social Protection has also requested the assistance of the OECD in developing the Youth Guarantee Policy.<\/p><p>   It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee for consideration by the Government in December before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of 2013. Development of the implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met (how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely requirement from EU funds, e.g. European Structural Fund and Youth Employment Initiative).  The amount that will be required for Ireland will only become clear when the implementation plans are drawn up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH02850"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[43043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500066#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 550 of 18 September 2013, if contact has been made with the person regarding the progress of the appeal in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; the progress made in respect of determination of the appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 08<sup>th<\/sup> August 2013.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. <\/p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,624 at 7 October 2013.  <\/p><p>The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to September 2013 reducing to 35.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.7 weeks for a summary decision.   <\/p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500067#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[43079\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500067#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a domiciliary care allowance appeal will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare.","asker":"1053","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 17 September 2013.

The Department is, however, currently looking at ways to increase the resources in the Unit.   <\/p><p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that the control process is an integral part of the day-to-day operations of the Department and all staff involved in the administration of the various social welfare schemes are acutely aware of the need to implement appropriate controls at every stage of the process.  <\/p><p>  The Department's control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this activity.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  <\/p><p>  Control savings recorded by SIU from January to September 2013 are &euro;53.3m while, during the same period in 2010, control savings amounted to &euro;34.8m.  These savings are not recorded on a county basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500067#WRJ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Appeals","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500067#WRJ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[43168\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500067#WRJ03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on an appeal for one-parent family payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry.

One of the key factors when pension assessment is being made is the date of entry into insurance and it is from this point that the averaging is calculated. <\/p><p>  The average contributions test is used in calculating pension entitlement and has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The system was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions from the outset rather than waiting for contributions to build up, and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited and people could move in and out of coverage as a result of the nature of their employment and\/or their earnings.<\/p><p>  There can be circumstances where a person with a shorter contribution history  could receive a higher pension  and this is why  it is planned to introduce a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where pension payment made will more closely reflect contributions made over a working life. This will remove the current anomaly whereby some people qualify for higher pension payments even though they have fewer contributions (but a higher average) than others who do not qualify, or qualify for a lower pension, due to the average contributions test. <\/p><p>  In introducing such a system, it is considered appropriate to have regard to the potential that people now have to accumulate contributions as a result of the comprehensive nature of social insurance coverage which has been in place for 20 years, and the growth in the labour force over that period. Accordingly, a total contributions requirement of 30 years contributions for a maximum pension will be introduced.  The proposed date for its introduction is 2020, but I am keeping this date under review. <\/p><p>  The rate band changes for State pension, introduced in September 2012 goes somewhat towards this measure of reform where pension paid more closely reflects contributions made over a working life.   <\/p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System which was published in April 2013 also endorsed the move to a total rather than an average contributions test to determine entitlement to a State pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500068#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Eligibility","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500068#WRK03150"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[43416\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500068#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her reasons for not accepting Deputy Denis Naughten's innovative proposal on linking child-benefit payments to school attendance; if she acknowledges that such a system would help reduce the incidence of early school leaving, school absenteeism, child-benefit fraud and would eliminate overseas payments; the savings her Department estimates would be achieved from such a system; and if she will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>Child benefit is a universal monthly payment that assists all families with in the many costs associated with raising children up to the age of 18 years. Child benefit is paid to around 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion. Child benefit is a highly valued income support by families, and is especially important during a time of recession and unemployment.<\/p><p>  It is a statutory requirement that a child attends school up to 16 years of age. Consequently, all recipients of child benefit are already legally required to attend school up to this age. There is a national monitoring system for statutory school attendance via the National Educational Welfare Board under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. For children over 16 years and less than 18 years, the continuation of child benefit is dependent on the children attending school for these two years. The Department of Social Protection issues a confirmation letter to parents with children at age 16 and at age 17, which must be signed by their school for each of these years. I am satisfied that the requirement for school attendance for children in receipt of child benefit is already a feature of both education and social protection policy. If the Deputy has concerns about early school leaving and school absenteeism, he should direct these to the competent authorities, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the National Education Welfare Board. <\/p><p>  My Department has taken a proactive approach to ensure that child benefit is only paid to eligible families. In 2008 the Department commenced issuing continuing eligibility certificates to parents. The control policy for the child benefit scheme was reviewed in 2010 to ensure that controls on fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant. As a result of this review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised. The total savings from child benefit control activity was &euro;48.5 million in 2008, &euro;89 million in 2009, &euro;106 million in 2010, &euro;85 million in 2011 and &euro;83 million in 2012.  The reduction in the level of savings achieved is due to the effectiveness of the control programme in recent years. This is also reflected in the savings achieved so far in 2013, which amount to just under &euro;54 million.  <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that child benefit payment is classified as a family benefit under EU regulations. A key principle of the coordination system is that persons moving to different Member States are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of those Member States.  Therefore, EU nationals who come to work in Ireland, and who pay Irish social insurance contributions, are entitled to receive child benefit in respect of their children, even if the children reside in another EU Member State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500068#WRK03300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Eligibility","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500069#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[43417\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500069#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on whether the minimum hours in employment condition of the family income supplement scheme is a barrier to those taking up low-paid employment or continuing in low-paid employment; her views on whether it is equitable that a person working 30 hours per week is entitled to a family income supplement while a person working 15 hours per week is not entitled to a family income supplement or any other social welfare payment due to the hours of work; the options available to a person whose hours of employment have been reduced below the minimum hours of employment and where he or she does not qualify for a jobseeker's payment as the hours of employment mean that the person is not available for work; if she will consider this situation and review the minimum hours requirement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

FIS also preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming social welfare.  Expenditure on FIS for 2012 was of the order of &euro;224 million in respect of some 32,000 families. The estimated expenditure for 2013 is expected to be &euro;229 million.<\/p><p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996. Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have expenditure implications.

The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports. In this regard the Group is considering how employment incentives might be improved.

The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.

The main advantage of digital over analogue technology is that it can be used to accommodate more radio services into less spectrum or frequencies.  Regarding signal coverage, my understanding is that a DAB transmitter is expected to provide slightly less coverage than an FM transmitter.  This means that if an FM transmitter was replaced by a DAB transmitter, there may be no DAB signal at all in areas where there had previously been a poor FM signal. <\/p><p>  In regard to the general provision of DAB services, the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital radio in Ireland.  This Act gives RT&Eacute; the power to establish and operate a multiplex for the purposes of providing a digital sound broadcasting service and gives the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) responsibility for licensing spectrum in respect of digital sound broadcasting services.  In addition, it provides that the primary responsibility for ensuring the development of commercial digital radio rests with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p>  In regard to the current availability of DAB services in Ireland, RT&Eacute; operates a DAB service from five sites around the country and there is also a commercial trial DAB service operating from Three Rock Mountain near Dublin.  I should also mention that the 2009 Act permits analogue sound broadcasting contractors to be retransmitted in a digital format on UPC and other cable television systems and a number of radio services are available in a digital format via this medium. These include RT&Eacute; radio services and a number of local and national sound broadcasters. <\/p><p>  While there are no plans at present to rollout DAB services on a national basis, the BAI will continue to monitor and consider the potential for the development of digital radio in Ireland. In this regard, the BAI has supported various DAB trials, has organised research and will further discuss the potential for DAB or other types of digital radio services through stakeholder meetings in 2013 and 2014. <\/p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>the national radio services are available on SAORVIEW and SAORSAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN01775"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[43251\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding geo thermal energy here in the future; if the energy and technology used is the same as that used in fracking, and his plans to consult with the public in seeking approval for the use of such technology.

Supporting electricity from deep geothermal is likely to be very expensive and it is not one of the technologies supported by renewable energy feed-in tariffs.<\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has supported a number of studies into geothermal energy, including &ldquo;Play Fairway Analysis of the Geothermal Potential of Ireland&rdquo;.  Proposed projects may also be considered for funding under the SEAI's Renewable Energy Research, Demonstration and Development programme. <\/p><p>  In regard to the question of regulation of the industry, a draft Geothermal Energy Development Bill is available on my Department's website.  The intention of the Bill is to create a legislative framework to facilitate the exploration for, and development of, geothermal energy resources.  Key elements will include exploring (prospecting) for geothermal energy, regulation of developments above a certain level of capacity, environmental practices, and safety.  The policy objective is to facilitate development of both large and small scale systems.  It is expected that the Geothermal Energy Development Bill will be published in the second half of 2014. <\/p><p>  The processes for the production of deep geothermal energy are different to those used for hydraulic fracturing.  For large projects, which require deep geothermal energy extraction, such as power generation or district heating, it may involve drilling two boreholes - one to bring water to the heat source and a second to bring the heated water back to the surface to be used for energy.  Sand and chemicals are not used and it does not require the fracturing of rocks.  Any proposed geothermal projects would be subject to the planning legislation, including as appropriate the requirements for a full Environmental Impact Statement and public consultation.  Currently, there are no large geothermal installations in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Grid","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02250"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[43255\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason EirGrid proposed super pylons section of Grid 25 in Kildare south are not being buried underground; and if he has discussed this issue with the local community who have serious concerns about living close to these pylons.","asker":"1037","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>This is an operational matter for EirGrid and not one in which I, as Minister, have a role or function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":541,"content":"<p>Question No. 196 answered with Question No. 192.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02550"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[43300\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500071#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the progress of the implementation of the National Broadband Plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.

It was also agreed that the Department of Social Protection would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP.<\/p><p>  My Department is also working closely with the County and City Managers Association (CCMA) in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to the test phase, which is planned for 2014 (subject to the enactment of the relevant legislation).  A Project Implementation Team is in place and will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases.  The CCMA has identified Limerick as the lead authority to drive implementation in the local government sector, the other authorities currently nominated for the test phase are: South Dublin County Council; Louth County Council; Kilkenny County Council; Waterford City Council; Cork County Council; and Monaghan County Council.<\/p><p>  A detailed business process design exercise for HAP involving input from all the relevant key stakeholders has been finalised.  The Implementation Team will now, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for testing the scheme in the selected authorities in 2014 (subject to the required legislation being in place), with full roll out of the scheme to follow once the test phase is complete.  Consideration, where possible, will be given to what aspects of the scheme can be assessed under existing mechanisms prior to enactment of the required legislation.<\/p><p>  HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need and ensuring significant efficiencies in the provision of rental assistance.  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance, and will in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment in the rent supplement scheme, by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. <\/p><p>  Local authorities will not enter into leases with the landlord in HAP.  Under the new scheme applicants will source their own accommodation within the private rented market (as currently happens with rent supplement) and the length of the tenancy, as with the tenancy agreement, will be a matter between the HAP recipient and the private landlord.  The local authority will pay the new assistance payment on the tenant&rsquo;s behalf directly to the landlord.  The tenant will pay a rental contribution to the local authority based on the differential rent scheme for the relevant local authority. <\/p><p>  During the test phase, it is envisaged that the authorities will initially focus on new applicants before moving on a progressive basis to those already in receipt of Rent Supplement.  It is also intended that the test phase will prioritise, as much as possible, the transfer of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients to HAP.  This is a reasonable approach to implementation, which will allow any issues that arise to be dealt with in a graduated way and give local authorities sufficient time to scale up the operation of HAP within their housing directorates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500072#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Exemptions","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500072#WRO02750"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[43561\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500072#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will address the points raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding off road declarations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>The primary purpose of the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 is to replace the system whereby a vehicle is only declared off the road when the owner next goes to tax it with a system where the vehicle has to be declared off the road in advance.

Under company law, a company that has been struck off has a period of one year within which to provide the Registrar with the relevant information and accounts.

The Strategy is being led out under the stewardship of my colleague Minister of State at the Department of Health Mr. Alex White T.D., who under this remit liaises and meets with Ministerial colleagues, Departments and agencies as is required.

A proactive approach is being applied with the emphasis being placed on known areas of anti-social behaviour and public order incidents.  Measures are in place to address difficulties experienced by local residents and businesses including the designation of certain areas as hotspots for such criminality and with additional high-visibility patrols being directed by local Garda management.<\/p><p>  A number of Garda Operations are being conducted in the North Inner City which actively combat the issue of anti-social behaviour.  Operation Stilts utilises a high visibility presence to police identified areas including O'Connell Street, Marlborough Street, Talbot Street, North Earl St, Abbey St, Eden Quay, the Boardwalk, Wolfe Tone Street, Parnell Street and adjacent side streets to prevent and disrupt the activities of persons involved in anti-social behaviour and drug offences.  In December 2012 the operation was further intensified by combining the use of uniformed high-visibility personnel and plain clothes personnel.<\/p><p>  Operation Spire provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O'Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime through a robust regime of arrests, seizures, and by issuing anti-social behaviour orders.  In this regard, Garda&iacute; have made successful application for Orders from the District Court against a number of individuals, who have been banned from specific areas within the city centre.<\/p><p>  The levels of activity and resources applied to particular Garda Operations fluctuate according to circumstances and these Operations are a part of the overall policing activity in the area.

More generally, local Garda management engage on an ongoing basis with a wide range of local businesses, community groups and other organisations with a view to addressing the many issues associated with policing a busy city centre with a vibrant night time economy.  In particular, the Garda authorities participated in the multi-stakeholder Strategic Response Group (SRG) which published the report &quot;A Better City for all&quot; in June 2012.

In this context, a new roster for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been introduced.  The outcome of the new roster is to match the varying policing demands across the country with the availability of resources.  The new roster is more flexible and it results in having more Garda&iacute; on duty when the demand is greater.  It also enables Garda management to make more efficient use of available resources generally, with the result that the amount of overtime required to be worked by Garda members is reduced.<\/p><p>In addition, the Haddington Road Agreement provides two specific measures which impact on the demand for overtime.  Firstly, voluntary Garda overtime will be worked at a reduced rate of time and one quarter rather than time and a half and, secondly, each Garda, Sergeant and Inspector will work an additional 3 days each year in the period 2013 - 2015, providing almost 400,000 additional policing hours to the Commissioner which, in turn, contribute towards reducing Garda overtime expenditure.<\/p><p>More generally, Garda management, as part of the efficiency drive which must continue right across the public service, are keeping under continuing review the scope for measures, whether through better deployment or otherwise, which have the potential to reduce the need for overtime.  The priority will remain the deployment of the maximum number of Garda&iacute; on frontline operational duties, and indeed the crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office reflect the excellent work being done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500076#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Training","counter":748,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500076#WRS02650"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[43510\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500076#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his plans to reopen Templemore College will be prioritised so that recruitment and training of new garda&iacute; may recommence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year.  This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.<\/p><p>  In that context,  I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013.  Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks.  Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.  This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway.  This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received.  The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500076#WRS03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Procedures","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500077#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[43556\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500077#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 138 of 26 September 2012 and 426 of 8 October 2013, if he will provide a breakdown of the courts in the 24 districts managed by the Courts Service that are enforcing section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010; and the level of enforcement taking place in each of those districts.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Courts Service has put in place arrangements to ensure that summonses issued since May 2012 include wording to advise persons charged with an offence under the Road Traffic Acts to bring their driving licence together with a photocopy of the licence when they are attending court.

Payment of the pension ten days in advance on the 20th of the month was introduced some years ago to overcome banking and payroll operational restrictions. However, as a result of technology and business process improvements these restrictions no longer apply. There are underlying administrative costs, such as the costs arising from the early draw-down of funds, associated with paying Defence Forces pensions in advance on the 20th of the month. My Department fully appreciates that, in returning payment of all military pensions to the end of the month, a certain proportion of people may currently have financial, banking and bill-paying arrangements (such as standing orders, direct debits) organised around the 20th. Any inconvenience caused by this move is of course regretted, but there is an obligation on all public service bodies to reduce administrative costs to the greatest extent possible. <\/p><p>  As part of the regular, ongoing interaction between my officials and the main military pensioner associations, this move was notified to them well in advance to get their feedback. I understand that they in turn informed their respective memberships.  In that regard, the pensioner associations raised some concerns, including the timeframe for implementation of the move and the impact on banking and bill-paying transaction dates.  <\/p><p>  Insofar as the Department could, those concerns were taken on board. This included writing to all the pensioners concerned about the reasons for the move some eight weeks before the first scheduled date change on 22 November 2013, and phasing in the move over a period of six months.  This is to give people sufficient time to make any necessary changes to their banking and other arrangements before the start of the move, should they wish to do so, and to ease in the change incrementally over a reasonable period.  The move will be fully completed by end-April 2014.  The December 2013 pension payment will be paid before the Christmas period.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500078#WRU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Training","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500078#WRU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[43186\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500078#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of standard ENCO courses underway nationwide; if it was necessary for all those participating on the courses to complete an application form; if specific candidates were encouraged by superior officers to undertake these courses; if there has been unexplained withdrawals from such courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture is a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate regarding the issues surrounding commonage lands, the views of the various stakeholders having being sought and considered by the Committee. As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed. My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process. It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department - it very clear that matters to be resolved are very wide ranging and complex; it is self-evident that the process required to adequately address these must be fully inclusive and focused. To this end, I am determined, as indicated, to convene a broad group of all relevant stakeholders, charged with comprehensively addressing the range of issues.  <\/p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem.  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.<\/p><p>  Following the successful completion of the negotiations on CAP reform under the Irish Presidency on 26 June 2013, I launched a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders to ascertain their views on the most appropriate application of the Direct Payment Regulation. The final date for submissions on the Consultative Paper is 20th September. The agreement provides that where there is marginal land the applicant or applicants must graze that land if he or she is to satisfy the eligibility criteria to be deemed an active farmer for the purposes of benefiting from payment under the Direct Payment Scheme. As most of the commonage land declared in Ireland can only be maintained by grazing, this matter will also have to be dealt with in the context of maintaining commonages in Ireland.    <\/p><p>  Taking all of these matters into account, it is my stated aim is to ensure that a practical solution is reached, which will ensure that the current farmers actively farming these lands are protected; that the land is maintained or returned to GAEC and that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are met. In my view, this can best be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders. I have no doubt that work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture will greatly assist in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500079#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500079#WRV02350"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[43098\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500079#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the single farm payment has ceased in respect of those companies or businesses which were found to have contributed to the horse meat scandal.

At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.   There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year. In view of the size and structure of farm enterprises in Ireland, farmers are fully aware of all of the non-eligible areas of their holdings.<\/p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.  <\/p><p>  As part of the clearance process a bi-lateral meeting was held on 25th July between the EU Commission Clearance auditors and my Department.

The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by the 31st October 2013. I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected. <\/p><p>In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved. These diplomatic channels were used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions. However, despite initial positive soundings from all those canvassed, when   the Irish Ambassador in Moscow met Mr Vladimir Kabanov, Deputy Head of the Department for Children&rsquo;s Rights at the Ministry for Education and Science he was informed that the amendment to the law applies to all cases that had not applied to the Court to finalise their adoptions by the date of 2 July 2013.  In saying that it was agreed that the Ministry for Education and Science will verify the status of the Irish families in the Russian adoption system The Embassy is assisting in this process. <\/p><p>Therefore it is apparent that the Russian Authorities will not move to address the difficulties faced by these Irish applicants due to the amendments to the Russian legislation. As I have previously indicated   I have received representations that include a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation. As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  These legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department. <\/p><p>  I have also arranged to meet applicants affected by this situation later this week to update them on the situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500083#WRZ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":1063,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500083#WRZ02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[43063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500083#WRZ02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to amend the Child Care Act 1991; if she will be amending section 54 of that Act; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Health and Social Care Professionals Council which was established in March 2007 provides for statutory registration of twelve separate health and social care professions including radiographers.  The Radiographers Registration Board has been established and is expected to open its register shortly.<\/p><p>  One aspect of statutory registration is the possession of an &ldquo;approved qualification&rdquo;.  In the absence of statutory registration, persons are free to work in the private health sector in Ireland without having their qualifications recognised.  However, persons wishing to work in the publicly-funded health sector in Ireland who have obtained their qualifications outside the State must apply to have their professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005\/36\/EC.  Such qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the public health sector.<\/p><p>  The Directive provides for mutual recognition of qualifications for certain professions.  In the case of the health and social care professions, including radiography, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State.  It provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the formal qualifications and professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host member state, i.e. Ireland.  <\/p><p>Because of the time-consuming nature of the case-by-case assessment, the Directive sets out timescales for the recognition process.  It provides that applications must be acknowledged within one month and the applicant informed of any missing document.  A final decision must be communicated to the applicant within 4 months of submission of a complete application.     My Department's website advises that persons should not seek employment in their professional capacity in the public health sector unless and until their qualifications have been recognised.<\/p><p>  In the case of the applicant to whom the Deputy refers, an incomplete application was initially received on 31 July 2013 and the complete application was received and acknowledged on 5 September 2013.  Accordingly, a decision on her application is due by 5 January 2014 which is fully compliant with the Directive's timescales.  I appreciate that the Deputy and the applicant would wish that a decision on her application be made sooner.  However, the Directive requires that applications are considered on a case-by-case basis to provide for the assessment of both formal training and professional experience against Irish standards which, although time-consuming, is necessary to protect the public.  There is also a high volume of applications in the process at any given time.<\/p><p>  It is important that persons who propose to obtain their professional training abroad with a view to returning to Ireland to seek employment are aware of the requirements of the Directive which provides a mechanism for persons to have their non-Irish professional qualifications recognised here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500086#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Eligibility","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500086#WRCC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[43228\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500086#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant in view of the project review group interim report; the recommendations in the report; if he will provide an update on plans to replace these schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>The Government decided in June last that new statutory provisions should be established to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs.

The Weight Management Clinic has a full multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and all necessary equipment. <\/p><p>  While acknowledging a definite clinical need exists for those with chronic obesity, bariatric surgery is only required for the minority of obese patients (2% of the population). The vast majority of these patients require clinical treatment that is both hospital and community based as indicated by the HSE-ICGP Weight Management Treatment Algorithm, the clinical care pathway utilised by health-care professionals. Early detection and treatment are key.  We now have indicative evidence to show that we are halting the incidence of overweight and obesity and that future work will seek to reverse the trend.  My Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO), with whom I meet regularly, is progressing the obesity prevention agenda.  Some of the measures and initiatives to help reverse the growing prevalence of obesity in the Irish population include Calorie posting and publication of the Healthy Eating Guidelines to inform people about the food and drink choices required for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to<b><\/b>  consume to maintain health and well-being.  SAGO has recently established a sub-committee to investigate and develop a range of options to support healthy eating.  The Department of Health has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, with regard to the marketing of food and drink to children towards a new Children's Code up to 18 years, to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks up to 7pm.  Treatment algorithms inform primary care staff of the steps to be taken with regard to managing obesity.  Both 'adult' and 'child' algorithms have been agreed with health care professionals and are now available. <\/p><p>  A key feature of the development of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>   was engagement and collaboration across Government Departments.

To ensure this, I will direct the Chairperson of HIQA to ensure that my patient safety priorities are reflected in their monitoring programme against the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare. <\/p><p>  My Department will be leading the development of a Strategic Plan for Maternity Services in collaboration with the HSE which will provide the blueprint for the safe effective delivery of maternity services nationally.  The Department will oversee the development of this national maternal strategy and it will be informed by our own national expertise as well as an international analysis of maternity and gynaecology service configurations and best practice models of care.   <\/p><p>  I have already mandated the National Early Warning Score as the first National Clinical Guideline.  Ireland was the first country to do this.  I am now requesting the development of similar guidelines for national maternity early warning score, national paediatric early warning score, sepsis and clinical hand over.<\/p><p>  Finally, I am continuing to examine this extremely important and comprehensive report.  In the meantime, I have written to both HIQA and the HSE giving further directions to both organisations on how progress on the implementation of the recommendations should be monitored and reported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500087#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500087#WRDD02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[43523\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500087#WRDD02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) in County Laois will receive orthodontic treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.

Upon enactment, section 25 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 will replace and restate Section 84 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 concerning the making of bye-laws by Local Authorities with regard to stands for taxis.  Funding for taxi ranks may be awarded\u00a0by the National Transport Authority (NTA) pursuant to section 69 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 as amended by the Bill (section 74).<\/p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 is a vast improvement upon the legal provisions contained in the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 prescribes more precisely the scope of the regulatory powers for licensing, enforcement and regulation by the NTA, which already has responsibility for the regulation of the taxi industry as provided for under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  Within the legal framework provided for in the Taxi Bill the role of the regulator is balanced against the rights of the license holder or applicant and the rights and protections for passengers, thereby providing clear guidance for all concerned within the taxi industry.<\/p><p>  The Taxi Bill makes provision under Section 20 for the NTA to prescribe in Small Public Service Vehicle(SPSV) regulations the standards for vehicles and for taxi drivers.  This is a restatement and refinement of\u00a0existing provisions under Section 34 and 39 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  There is ongoing improvement in the regulation of vehicle standards by the NTA on foot of\u00a0the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011.  The prohibition on the transfer of SPSV licences provided for under Section 14 of the Taxi Bill together with the recent changes to vehicle age will, I believe,\u00a0have a significant impact in this regard, with safety benefits for taxi drivers, taxi users and other road users.  With regard to the standards for taxi drivers, as I explained in Dail Debates on the Taxi Bill it is my view\u00a0that regulations made in this area can only improve and promote the standards of professionalism in the industry and, as with all of the powers conferred on the NTA, it is incumbent on it to ensure that these powers are exercised in a reasonable manner.<\/p><p>  The provisions under Section 24 of the\u00a0Taxi Bill provide for a restatement of existing provisions in the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 concerning maximum fares in the State.  The setting of the maximum taxi\u00a0fare is\u00a0a statutory function of the NTA.  A review of taxi fares is carried out every two years by the Authority. Under the fares review this year, the NTA put forward a proposal to simplify the overall fare structure and to provide an approximate 3.6% to 4% increase in the maximum allowable fares.  However, following consultation with the taxi advisory committee and the various different taxi groups, it was decided not to make any changes to the existing fares structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Roads Maintenance Issues","counter":1296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[43226\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that up to 50 HGVs per hour are using a residential street (details supplied) in County Kilkenny causing infrastructural damage and putting health and safety of residents at risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1298,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

I intend to publish a draft National Aviation Policy Statement by year end and this will provide a further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":1330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1331,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[43651\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF02900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he intends to apply for funding under the Trans European Network&ndash;Transport (Ten-T) 2014-2020 for the development of a rail network linking Derry to Limerick, Shannon and Cork, or any part thereof, along a western arc corridor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1332,"content":"<p>As I have indicated to the House previously, I have no plans to develop a so-called &quot;Western Arc&quot; rail line from Cork to Belfast as this would require both the re-opening of the remaining phases of the Western Rail Corridor and also the development of new rail lines to connect with the rail network in Northern Ireland.  It should also be noted that the Northern Ireland Executive has no plans to provide such new rail lines.  The Government's policy in relation to the funding of capital projects to 2016, including the development of rail and road links, is set out in the <i>&quot;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-16: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&quot;.<\/i>  Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.  The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation.<\/p><p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Programme for Government and in particular the commitment that: <i>&quot;We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>  The Irish Rail commissioned AECOM\/Goodbody &#8220;2030 Rail Network Strategy Review&#8221; examined the potential for new and re-opened lines and it did not recommend the development of a rail link between Sligo and Derry or between Donegal and Derry. Likewise its predecessor, the &#8220;Strategic Rail Review&#8221; in 2003 did not recommend such rail links.  The performance of Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor between Ennis to Athenry to date has been very disappointing even allowing for the recession.  Given the pressure on the public finances there\u00a0 are no funds for new subsidies or to develop new rail links in any part of the country.  Moreover CIE is in a precarious financial situation and is dependent on continued bank funding.  For all the reasons outlined above, the Government has no plans to further extend the heavy rail network. In\u00a0these circumstances the question of applying for Ten-T funding to develop a rail line between Cork and Belfast via Shannon, Limerick and Derry does not arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Provision","counter":1333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1334,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[43652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101500089#WRFF03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details of correspondence between his Department and the EU Committee on Petitions to date in 2013 regarding the European Regional Development Fund, the Western Rail Corridor and the Atlantic Corridor; his proposals to address the issues raised by the committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In my response I refuted\u00a0the claim by the Petitioner that the Government, and my Department in particular, has discriminated against the West\/North West of Ireland in terms of capital infrastructure investment and EU funds.  I pointed out that\u00a0 neither the BMW Region nor the Irish exchequer has lost out on or under-claimed ERDF funding. In fact the allocation for\u00a0public transport in the BMW region was increased during the programme period.
