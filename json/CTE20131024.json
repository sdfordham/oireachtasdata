In order to assist us in our deliberations we sought the views of interested individuals and organisations and received ten written submissions.  To enable us to develop an understanding of the key issues identified in the process, we decided to hear evidence from key individuals and groups on the matter.  Yesterday, we heard from the Department of Social Protection and five groups and individuals.  Today is the second of these hearings and we will hear from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, represented by Noeline Blackwell and Yvonne Woods; the Equality Authority represented by Brian Merriman, Dr. Fergus Ryan and Dr. Tanya N&iacute; Mhuirthile; and Amnesty International represented by Marco Perolini.  Dr. Philip Crowley of the HSE will be available to respond to relevant issues.  I welcome the witnesses to this meeting and ask them to keep their submissions as close to five minutes as possible.

We are very grateful for the opportunity to come before the committee and to have this discussion with it.  We also appreciate a system which allows the scheme of the Bill to be discussed but we draw attention to the fact that where this has happened before and the Bill has come back into the Oireachtas for debates, the discussion has been limited on the basis that the committee has already covered it.  We hope that this will be the first of two steps in dealing with this particular tricky Bill.<\/p><p>  We circulated a submission in September 2013, which members will have seen, on the scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013.  We have also circulated our opening statement.  I will skim through that now in the hope that we might be able to discuss any issues that arise when everybody has had a chance to speak.<\/p><p>  FLAC has been dealing with this issue since 1997 on behalf of the person who, through no fault of her own, has been the longest-standing activist and campaigner in this area, Dr. Lydia Foy, who did not set out to be a campaigner but who sought recognition of her own rights.  We have been doing this since 1997.  Dr. Foy has been engaged in the process since 1993, some 20 years ago.  The dates are significant.  There has been litigation for 17 years and to this day Dr. Foy does not have a gender recognition certificate.  In that time we have considered Irish law and that of other countries and we have dealt with colleagues who are here today, whom the committee met yesterday, and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  We will, however, concentrate on the draft legislation.  We are concerned that, as a human rights issue, people have access to the basic documents they need to be identified in their lives.  That is part of the system of access to justice which is our core area.  In addition to the 17 years of litigation and the 20 years since Dr. Foy first looked for a certificate, this week marks six years since the High Court found that Dr. Lydia Foy's fundamental human rights under the European Convention of Human Rights had been breached by not having a gender recognition certificate.  The State appealed that decision but conceded in 2010, three years ago, that there was no appeal to take.  That first declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights, that Irish law was not compatible with European human rights law, occurred six years ago and remains extant.  On that basis the Gender Recognition Bill 2013 comes before the committee.<\/p><p>  We want to pick up on four particular issues, three of which arise in the Bill.  The fourth is absent from it.  Before I turn to the areas of major concern, we welcome the fact that in the scheme the Bill will not require gender reassignment surgery or other specified medical treatments as a precondition of recognition, and that it will also cover the position of intersex persons, although that is not our area of expertise.  Our first area of concern is forced divorce.  Under head 5(d) of the scheme of the Bill, couples would have to divorce as a condition of recognising the transgender partner in their preferred gender.  The State is on the horns of a dilemma on this point because however it looks at the problem, it is faced with the Irish constitutional and legal position of marriage.  This applies only to those who are married and seek recognition of their preferred gender.  It is a tiny number of people but nonetheless it is a real dilemma.  The State either permits the marriage to continue, in which case there is a very limited principle being breached, that no same-sex couple can be married in Ireland, although we have arguments about that, or, if it goes down the route which it is going down, it is disproportionately cruel and inhumane and in breach of the position of marriage in the Irish Constitution to require people to divorce in order to recognise another fundamental human right.  In facing this dilemma the State has plumped for a policy decision and this is where we think the committee discussion may assist the Minister and the Department in identifying what is the least harm that would be done.<\/p><p>  In that connection we can point to what has happened in Germany, a country which does not have marriage for same-sex couples, and similarly Austria.  Both countries faced the same dilemma and have permitted the marriage to continue on the basis that the couple was married at a time when everything seemed right and that it would be disproportionately in breach of other human rights to force the marriage to end, particularly in a country where divorce requires not just separation for four of the previous five years, but irretrievable breakdown of the relationship.  Somebody is going to have to lie at some stage of this procedure.  We have set that out in more detail in our submission.  I will ask Yvonne Woods to deal with the question of the minimum age limit in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382605500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Head 5(d) of the scheme of the Bill proposes issuing certificates only to people aged at least 18 on the date of application.  We have in the past had a different position on the minimum age but have adjusted it in recent times because we have become more aware, through contacts with various groups and talking to transgender people, that this is not inclusive.  Now we suggest that the minimum age be 16, with consent of a parent or guardian as well as the applicant himself or herself.  This is also the age at which young persons can consent to medical treatment.  We have also suggested that consideration be given to the creation of a provisional or temporary gender recognition certificate for younger applicants.  Such certificates could be renewed or converted into full recognition certificates at the age of 16 or 18.  This recognises the fact that young people are declaring themselves and coming forward at an earlier age, with the support of their families, and need to be recognised by the legislation, which is currently not the case.<\/p><p>  The necessity for a treating physician's statement under head 6 of the Bill moves back to treating transgenderism as a medical disorder. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1382605500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We had agreed a process whereby we would have one speaker per group.

We acknowledge the very significant progress this Bill represents since the initial consultation process began.  We pay tribute to the excellent advocacy done on behalf of transgender people by the groups who attended the committee yesterday and also to the Minister and to the Department for listening and implementing many positive changes in this draft Bill.<\/p><p>  We encourage the continuation of this process of engagement and listening in order to address the relatively few but none the less crucial matters that if correctly addressed in the final legislation will result in the type of recognition that will benchmark Ireland as an inclusive, respectful society for transgender people.  There is a clear, urgent legal imperative for such reform as it is six years since the High Court concluded in the Foy case that Ireland was in breach of its commitment under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Gender recognition has been available in the United Kingdom since 2004, a factor that places Ireland in breach of its commitment to ensure that human rights protections in the State are at least equivalent to protections available to people in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Equality Authority has a remit to prevent discrimination and to vindicate rights.  People who identify as or who are imputed as transgender or who are intersex typically experience high levels of discrimination.  In addition, research has highlighted a high suicide rate and high levels of harassment and violence directed at transgender people in public places.  Particular difficulties also arise in accessing employment, health care and leisure facilities.  Too many transgender people live in poverty due to increased difficulties in accessing the labour market.<\/p><p>  The Equality Authority and its predecessor body, the Employment Equality Agency, have for some decades included the equality rights of transgender and intersex people in the working definition of the gender ground.  This approach has been endorsed by the decision of the European Court of Justice in P <i>v.<\/i> S and Cornwall County Council.  The authority has no objection to an amendment explicitly naming transgender as a protected ground under the equality legislation.<\/p><p>  In 2004 the Equality Authority highlighted the precarious legal situation of transgender people in its two reports, Transsexualism and Gender Dysphoria and Access to Health Services for Transsexual People.  The authority was instrumental in renegotiating a settlement with the State Examinations Commission that led in 2007 to the reissuing of intermediate and leaving certificates to a transgender woman.  The commission agreed to alter the certificate so as to reflect the woman's new name and preferred gender.  More recently the authority supported the landmark Hannon case concerning the treatment of a transitioning worker.  The successful outcome sets a useful guideline for employers to accommodate the needs of their transitioning employees.<\/p><p>  I will list the key areas to be considered by the committee for amendment.  We welcome the central tenet of the Bill in head No. 6 that a person who wishes to be recognised in his or her preferred gender may make a statutory declaration to that effect.  This respects the autonomy of the person and his or her integrity in deciding to seek legal gender recognition.  The authority has advised against pathologising transgender people.  There is a risk, however, that the requirement that a treating physician must certify that a person has transitioned will introduce a requirement of medical certification in practice.  This point in addressed in detail on page eight of our submission.  It is respectfully suggested that the presence or absence of such medical certification should not be considered absolutely conclusive where an application is made for legal gender recognition.<\/p><p>  On the ground of age, early recognition is very important to the well-being and self-worth of young transgender or intersex people.  The general scheme proposes in head No. 5 that applicants for gender recognition be aged 18 or over.  Certainly, complex legal issues arise with regard to the recognition of people under the age of 18 but legal norms already used in dealing with this should not be excluded purely because a young person wishes to transition.  In law, a person aged 16 or over is competent to make medical and surgical decisions on his or her own behalf without requiring parental consent.  It is unclear why the Government has not considered these established mechanisms that would afford young transgender and intersex people the right to access legal gender recognition with, for instance, the consent of a young person's parents or guardians or independently from the age of 16, as is allowed with many other elements of a young person's health and well-being which we recommend.  This is of concern in that transition is being excluded from the normal remedies available for young people and may fall foul of the constitutional requirements to respect the autonomy of the family and the rights and duties of parents in respect of their children.  <\/p><p>  On civil status, the authority's long-standing commitment to equal marriage for consenting adults envisages such situations as now arise in this Bill.  The requirements of the heads of the Bill that applicants for legal gender recognition be single is neither necessary nor desirable.  In particular, the imposition of the requirement will pose significant hardship on families where a spouse or civil partner wishes to gain legal recognition of the preferred gender.  <\/p><p>  In its 2010 submission to the gender recognition and advisory group, the authority noted that such approach was not, in fact, legally necessary.  The submission noted that the legal validity of a marriage is determined solely by reference to the factors, including the status of the parties present at the date of marriage.  It is the gender of each party at the date of marriage that counts in determining the validity of the marriage.  Thus, if the spouses were legally male and female, respectively, on the date of their marriage, the marriage, in law, remains a heterosexual marriage, even if one of the parties subsequently transitions to a preferred gender.  Prospective legal recognition of a preferred gender would not change the essential fact that the marriage, judged by reference to the factors presented at the time of the marriage, is still, in law, a heterosexual marriage.  As such, the concern that gender recognition would convert a heterosexual marriage into a marriage between parties of the same sex is legally unfounded.  Many transgender people have been supported on their journeys by their spouses.  The Bill requires that at the conclusion of that journey the supportive spouse is then to be presented as the only remaining impediment to the proper gender recognition of the other.  This is harsh, unfair and of serious concern.  It essentially involves a bartering of rights between the couple, which sets an unnecessary and worrying precedent.  Where a couple who are married or in a civil partnership wish to remain together after the transition of a spouse, it may prove impossible for the transgender spouse to truthfully divorce to meet the proposed requirement that applicants be single.  The concept of forced divorce has serious human rights concerns and we believe it is legally unnecessary.  I defer to Dr. Ryan's recommendations on the validity of marriage and civil status, with which we broadly agree.<\/p><p>  In head No. 26, the general scheme proposes to permit transgender and intersex people to be excluded from competitive sport with a view to securing fair competition and the safety of competitors.  It is suggested that a more nuanced and individualised approach may be needed to ensure that head No. 26 does not serve to facilitate a blanket ban on the participation of transgender and intersex people in sports.  Visibility and role models are vital in educating society and creating a positive environment for transitioning young people.  In particular, we suggest that more emphasis may be placed on factors such as the level of hormones in a person's body rather than the simple fact that a person is transgender or intersex.  Our previous comments on the age ground and adolescence also have a bearing on this outcome.  Transgender people should be allowed full access to the facility of services available exclusively to persons of the preferred gender.  In particular, in line with the general principle contained in head No. 9, a person who is transgender or intersex should be treated for all purposes as a person of his or her preferred gender.  It is vital, for instance, that transgender and intersex people be entitled to use changing facilities and toilet facilities of the preferred gender.  In prisons and Garda holding cells, people who are transgender and intersex should be treated as persons of the preferred gender.  The authority would welcome an amendment to the Bill to ensure that this entitlement is specifically and expressly granted and recognised.<\/p><p>  The Equality Authority has commissioned a detailed report on this important Bill which we hope to make available to the committee in a number of weeks.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Merriman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382606100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak.  My overall aim is to offer whatever assistance I can to ensure that the Bill is as strong as possible in upholding the dignity and rights of transgender and intersex people.  There is both and legal and a social imperative for this legislation, which is to be welcomed.  Ireland stands in continued breach of our international legal obligations, particularly under the European Convention on Human Rights.  That this is so has been confirmed by the High Court in the Lydia Foy case, where a declaration of incompatibility was handed down.  Currently, a person's sex for legal purposes is fixed for life by reference to biological characteristics that are present at the time of birth.  Notwithstanding the lived reality of a person's daily life, Irish law treats the transgender person as being of the gender opposite to that in which the person is living and provides no facility to alter the legal gender to ensure congruence with the person's preferred gender.<\/p> <p>In this regard, the law patently fails to respect the dignity of the individual, in a manner which makes the already precarious social situation of the transgender or intersex person even more challenging.  While these people live their lives with enormous fortitude and bravery, both national and international research none the less underlines the extraordinary challenges they experience, including regular prejudice in the workplace and community.  The failure of the law, as it currently stands, to provide formal recognition of the preferred gender thus places an already vulnerable category of people in a legal quagmire.  Recognition would send out a very powerful signal that people in this situation are entitled by law to be treated with dignity and respect.<\/p><p> The scheme of the Bill contains much that is to be welcomed and represents a considerable advance on previous proposals for reform.  In fact, it is more progressive in many respects - significantly more progressive in some respects - than equivalent legislation in many other European states.  Nevertheless, there are several aspects which are of concern.<\/p><p> In regard to age requirements, the views and evolving capacity of the child should be acknowledged and respected, particularly in light of the recent referendum on children's rights.  A young person aged 16 or over may, under section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, validly give an independent consent to surgical or medical treatment.  Why then should he or she not be able to make a declaration under this proposed legislation?  Moreover, in the case of children aged under 16, it is arguable that parents or guardians should be allowed to apply on the child's behalf.  While I can foresee potential difficulties where the parents oppose recognition, there is no reason that a child should be excluded from the scheme where his or her parents are actively supportive and believe it is in his or her best interest.  There certainly is potential for resolution by means of a court order, but it is surely neither appropriate nor proportionate to shut the door entirely to applicants aged under 18.<\/p><p> The position of applicants who are married and in civil partnerships is also a point of concern.  The Bill effectively requires that any married or civilly partnered applicant who wishes to gain recognition must first terminate or annul the existing marriage or civil partnership.  It is worth reflecting on the serious impact this will have on transgender people and their spouses who remain happily married.  The first issue is that it is not immediately clear whether such persons can actually divorce, even if they wish to do so.  The law requires that in order to divorce, a married couple must be living apart, with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation, for four of the previous five years.  \"Living apart\" in this context requires a mental as well as a physical element; it is not just about living in separate places.  Rather, it effectively requires that the parties are living separate lives in circumstances where at least one of them has mentally resolved that the relationship is at an end.  Where the spouses are still happily married, I cannot see how they can feasibly establish that they are living apart.  Nor will it be possible to show that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.  Annulment as an alternative remedy poses different but equally challenging problems, something on which I will be happy to elaborate if there are any questions.<\/p><p> The distress that will be caused to married couples and the impact on the constitutionally protected family of the applicant far outweighs any benefit this requirement may yield.  At any rate, the single applicant requirement is arguable unnecessary.  As Mr. Merriman pointed out, the validity of a marriage is determined by reference to the situation that prevailed at the time of the marriage itself.  Thus, if the parties were respectively male and female at the time of the marriage ceremony, what happens after the marriage is celebrated should not affect its validity or essential character.  Judged as of the time of the marriage, therefore, the marriage of a person who subsequently alters his or her legal gender remains a heterosexual one.  As such, the single applicant requirement seems both disproportionate and unnecessary.<\/p><p> This Bill provides a useful opportunity to make discrimination on the basis of gender identity explicitly unlawful in the context of employment and the provision of goods and services and to ensure that all transgender people - not just those who are transitioning or have transitioned - are expressly protected from discrimination.  The legislation also offers a good opportunity to amend the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 to include gender identity and gender as grounds upon which incitement to hatred is prohibited.  Lawyers, doctors and academics do not have a monopoly of wisdom in this area.  It is important that Members of the Oireachtas should speak with and listen intently to those people with direct and daily experience of these issues, namely transgender and intersex people and their families.  It is vital that the legislation reflects and addresses their concerns.  While there is much to be welcomed in the Bill and it is certainly much more progressive than previous proposals and more progressive, too, than a great deal of what is in place in other EU states, there are nevertheless changes that could be made to make it the best it can be.  I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergus Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382606700,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Ryan.

I begin by highlighting the importance of legal recognition.  To be recognisable by the law is essential in order to fully participate in society.  By way of illustration, I refer to a case which came before the Australian High Court in 1979 concerning the validity of a marriage between a biologically born woman and her husband who was born with an intersex condition.  In other words, he was born with a body which combined both male and female biological traits.  As marriage was defined under Australian law as the union of a man and a woman, the court held that Mr. C, being neither a man nor a woman, was incapable of marrying anyone.  Where the law cannot recognise a person's preferred gender, that person may be excluded from the exercise of normal legal rights which he or she might otherwise expect to enjoy.  The impact of that is enormous.<\/p><p>  At present, the legal definition of gender is confirmed by the congruence of the chromosomes, gonads and genitals at birth.  There are two aspects of this test, namely the biological fact of congruence and, second, the temporal aspect of the birth moment, which is deemed conclusive.  This legislation proposes to enable those who either lack the congruence at birth or whose self-identity does not develop in line with their biological body to register an alteration in their legal gender and to have that change legally recognised.  This is an important development and is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  That said, we are here today to discuss the proposals and consider how to improve upon them.  In that regard, I have several constructive criticisms to offer, the first of which relates to age limits.  It is proposed that access to the rights contained in the legislation be confined to those who are 18 years of age or older. This criterion does not respect the dignity of young transgender or intersex people.  From the perspective of the young transgender person, it is important to note that such a person can, under section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, independently give legal consent to undergo gender reassignment procedures at the age of 16.  To grant young transgender people the authority to decide permanently to alter their bodies in this way while refusing to recognise legally the result of that alteration is inconsistent from a policy perspective.  Furthermore, it may be offensive to the newly inserted Article 42A of the Constitution on children's rights by failing to respect the right of children to form their own views and to have these views respected in line with their age and maturity.  Young transgender people can either make these life-changing decisions or they cannot.  Where such decisions are supported by parents or guardians, as alluded to by Dr. Ryan, to continue to refuse recognition is even less sound from a legal perspective and may breach Article 42 of the Constitution, which deals with family rights.<\/p><p>  This age constraint is particularly restrictive of the rights of intersex children.  Intersex can manifest at various stages throughout a person's life, whether at birth, childhood, puberty, in adulthood, or be discovered on autopsy.   At present, all births must be registered no later than three months after the birth takes place.  Where the existence of the intersex condition does not manifest until after this deadline, children may be stuck with a birth certificate that does not reflect their physical reality or the gender identity they subsequently develop.  Such a situation was considered by the High Court in S <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Ucht&aacute;la in 2009, which involved a child with an intersex condition who was the subject of a foreign adoption order.  The birth certificate and subsequent adoption certificate noted that the child was female.  However, upon closer medical examination when the child was brought back to Ireland, it was found that the specific intersex condition was more nuanced than originally thought and thus this child was more likely to identify as a boy.  His parents sought to have the adoption certificate amended to reflect this reality so that he could participate fully in society as a boy, attend a boys' school, play hurling as opposed to camogie and so on.  The Adoption Board refused the application as it considered granting such a request was beyond its authority.  On judicial review, the High Court found in favour of the boy's parents and ordered the alteration of the certificate.  Unfortunately, as this was an <i>ex tempore<\/i> judgment of the court, it is of limited precedential value and other families are not guaranteed as of right that they will secure new documentation for their intersex children.<\/p> <p>By refusing to permit those under 18, or their parents or guardians on their behalf, to make an application for legal recognition in a gender other than that recorded on the birth certificate, the proposed legislation continues to discriminate against intersex children.  Therefore, I recommend that the scheme be extended to permit applications by, or on behalf of, trans and intersex children and young people.<\/p><p> On 5 December last year, I appeared before the committee to advise it on this very matter in the context of the report of the gender recognition advisory group.  On that occasion I criticised the recommendation that applicants would need evidence of a diagnosis of gender identity disorder in order to successfully ground an application.  I noted that such a requirement would be contrary to the most recent statements of international human rights law on this issue.  Those statements basically recommend that access to legal rights such as gender recognition be decoupled from medical treatment pathways.  Effectively, recognition ought to depend upon diagnosis or other medical treatment.  From that perspective, I welcome the fact that there is no overt diagnostic criterion contained in the proposed legislative scheme under consideration.  However, that is not to say that the proposed legislation depathologises access to legal gender recognition by completely dispensing with the need for diagnosis.  Rather, head 6 of the proposed legislation requires that an applicant produce a \"statement from his\/her primary treating physician, in a form to be prescribed by the Minister, which confirms that the person has transitioned\/is transitioning to their acquired gender and that he\/she [i.e. the treating physician] is satisfied that the person fully understands the consequences of his\/her decision to live permanently in the acquired gender\".  In essence, applicants will require letters from their doctors confirming they are being or have been treated for a medical condition and that they understand the consequences of an application under this legislation.  This is diagnosis in disguise.  Yet it goes further than merely confirming diagnosis because the specialist is also required to state that applicants have sufficient mental capacity to fully appreciate the consequences of an application.  In this way, the proposed legislation not only maintains the diagnostic criterion, but also obliquely reinforces the prejudice that trans people suffer from a mental disorder.  This is at a time when the medical community is seriously considering removing the disorder aspect from trans diagnosis. Consequently, this requirement is considerably outmoded and I recommend that it be dispensed with in its entirety.<\/p><p> In my submission to the committee, I referred to the marriage criterion.  The latter has already been covered by many previous speakers.  In view of the time constraints involved, therefore, I will refer members to the comments I make on the matter in my submission.  I would be happy to answer any questions they may have on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tanya N&iacute; Mhuirthile","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382607300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>On behalf of Amnesty International I wish to thank the committee for inviting us to address it on this issue.  We are undertaking a project on human rights violations experienced by transgender people in Europe.  More specifically, we are planning to publish a report in the coming months on this issue.  Ireland will be one of the countries profiled in that report.<\/p><p>  Many countries in Europe have adopted laws or practices enacting legal gender recognition for transgender people.  In many instances, the procedures involved are lengthy and require adherence to criteria such as psychiatric diagnosis, medical treatments and single status.  In many cases, forced compliance with such criteria violate the human rights of individuals who wish to obtain legal recognition of their gender identity.  We welcome the steps Ireland has taken towards providing legal recognition of the gender identity of all individuals.  These certainly represent an important step forward in guaranteeing international protection of human rights of transgender and intersex people.  However, three key areas of the proposed scheme can be improved upon in order to better protect the human rights of transgender and intersex people.  I will briefly comment on each of these and I am sure we will have time to discuss them following all of the presentations.<\/p><p>  The first is the requirement under head 6 that a person must provide a statement from a physician in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate.  International human rights standards, notably the Yogyakarta principles, argue for procedures providing legal gender recognition to be \"efficient, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect the dignity and privacy of the person concerned\".  We are extremely concerned with regard to the lack of clarity surrounding the criteria by which a physician will assess whether a person has transitioned or is transitioning as required under the proposed provision.  We are also concerned that this requirement could be interpreted as requiring individuals to undergo medical treatment, such as hormonal or surgical procedures.  In some instances in other countries, medical evidence for the purposes of legal recognition stems from the interpretation of loosely formulated laws or practices.  This is the case in countries such as, for example, Norway and France.  For this reason it is imperative - from a human rights perspective - that the eventual legislation should provide clear guidance with regard to what will or will not be required.  In order to better comply with its human rights obligation, Ireland should be clear that legal gender recognition should be accessible to everyone - all transgender and intersex individuals - regardless of whether they want to or can access specific health treatments and without the requirement to obtain a psychiatric diagnosis.  Forcing individuals to undergo medical treatment as a requirement to access legal gender recognition would lead to violations of several internationally protected human rights, including the right to health and to protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  Laws recently adopted or discussed in a number of countries and domestic case law have clearly decoupled the issue of legal gender recognition from the requirement to undergo medical treatment.  I refer to countries such as Argentina, Germany, Malta, Sweden and Uruguay in this regard.<\/p><p>  Our second concern relates to the requirement under head 5 that a person not be in a marriage or civil partnership when applying for a gender recognition certificate.  Amnesty International regrets that the law in Ireland does not currently guarantee civil marriage equality for same-sex couples and fully supports the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that this be changed.  However, the current legal inequality regarding marriage should not be used to justify the curtailment of the rights of transgender and intersex people, by forcing them to choose between legal recognition of their gender identities and their existing marriages or civil partnerships.  The latter would, in fact, qualify as State-enforced divorces and would violate the family rights of transgender and intersex people in Ireland.  We, therefore, urge that this requirement not be included in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Our third concern relates to the age restrictions included in the general scheme of the Bill.  We are of the view that these restrictions should be reconsidered in light of the requirement on Ireland as a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which requires states to treat the best interests of children as a primary consideration in decisions affecting them.  Children seeking legal recognition of their gender identity must be given the chance to express their views regarding what constitutes their own best interest and to have these views taken into account according to their evolving capacities.  An individualised assessment of the situation of each child would, therefore, be more compliant with the requirements contained in the convention than would be the case with the current absolute restriction.  Argentina's gender identity law takes full account of this principle by allowing minors to obtain legal gender recognition if both they and their parents or guardians consent to it.  In Europe, countries such as Germany do not require any minimum age for accessing legal gender recognition.<\/p><p>  We urge that the Bill, if passed, ensure that the human rights of individuals seeking legal gender recognition are respected and that individuals will not be forced to undergo medical treatment or conform to stereotypical gender norms in order to access legal recognition of their gender identity.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to address the committee and I will be happy to answer any questions which members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Marco Perolini"},{"type":"speech","time":1382607300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>That is great.

I apologise in advance as the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will start after the Order of Business and, as spokesperson, I have the difficulty of trying to be in two places at once.  I might have to disappear.  This has been a useful exercise.  I thank everybody.  Yesterday, right across the board we had a good airing of the same issues that have come up today.  That has been useful.<\/p><p>  I have one or two brief questions.  If I am not present for the answers I will look at the transcript afterwards.  My first question is to Ms Woods.  I was interested in the temporary certificate that was mentioned.  Could she elaborate further on it because when I asked yesterday about what to do with those aged under 16, I was told that the 2004 Act would deal with intersex people.  We have heard today that it does not properly deal with the issue in the context of the court case that was mentioned.<\/p><p>  Another question is for Dr. Crowley.  Yesterday, we heard reference to the capacity of the health service.  What is its capacity in terms of gender reassignment operations?  If the restrictions are still in place, there are limited physicians in this country who could make an assessment if that is required under current legislation.  I got good responses to the questions I asked yesterday and the issues have been well reflected today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400008#G00100","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1382607900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and the written submissions we read in advance of the meeting.  A very strong case has been presented on the various issues, but especially on the fact that the forced divorce provisions are not only legally unnecessary but could be in breach of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  I read Dr. Fergus Ryan's paper in advance of the meeting and we discussed the issue.  The point has been well made about how the provisions are arguably disproportionate based on the German precedent which looks at not only its constitutional context but the same European Convention on Human Rights responsibilities as we have.  It was decided in that context on the basis of proportionality.  A strong argument has been made by the Equality Authority, FLAC and Dr. Fergus Ryan from a constitutional point of view.  The Council of Europe Commissioner on Human Rights has written to us on that point.  In addition, there was the decision of the German constitutional court.<\/p><p>  That makes me even more unhappy with the lack of engagement from departmental officials yesterday on the legal issue.  The officials are in the Gallery and I appreciate that they are listening to this meeting.  I hope the Department will reflect on the matter.  I accept that when we had representatives from the Department at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting they were not in a position to engage on the issue but it is essential that we would bring the Department back again at a later point to engage.  Yesterday, we were simply given a one-line explanation - that there is a constitutional context for the existence of the forced divorce provisions.  It is quite clear from the testimony we have had today that there are incredibly strong constitutional arguments that the legislation is completely repugnant not only to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, but also to the ECHR as well.  It would be bizarre for us to go through two days of hearings and a consultation process on the legislation and not to engage on that legal point and not have the Department discuss it with us.  That is not good enough.  It makes a mockery of the committee not to engage on such a significant issue.  I make a request to the Chairman in that regard.  We can discuss later among members that we should invite the Department back to engage on the issue.<\/p><p>  The point has been well made about age.  The suggestion was made yesterday that 16 year old transgender people will be 18 someday and perhaps they could wait until they are 18.  Sadly, that is not always the case because the rate of suicide among young transgender people is incredibly shocking.  A US study found that up to 50% of transgender youths will have made at least one suicide attempt by the time they are 18.  That is the context in which we are examining the legislation.  Yesterday, we heard about the practical, day-to-day struggles people have in terms of participation in the education system and how impossible that makes life for some and why children drop out of school because of the situation.  The age issue is crucial in the legislation because one is talking about incredibly vulnerable young people.  We have an opportunity to get that right.  What we are being asked to do is very simple.  The suggestion about temporary certificates, as raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, gets around some of the issues.  I agree with the point made about the acceptance by parents that surgery is in the best interests of their children.  Sometimes parents refuse operations that are important for their children and the courts have upheld their right to do so.  We give them responsibility in that regard and if parents agree that their child should be allowed to have their self-identified gender recognised, it is crazy that the State would interfere with that.  Perhaps the temporary certificate is a way to get around that for younger people.  The age of 16 is generally the age of legal capacity.  Do the witnesses agree with the suggestion that from the age of 16 upwards a young person should be able to make a decision in their own right but that before that, perhaps a temporary certificate with the permission of a parent is the best way to address the matter?  That deals with the issues raised by some speakers yesterday on concerns about regret.  We all have regrets about marriage and other long-term decisions.  Negative equity, which is a 35 year commitment, is one that people regretted quite soon afterwards.  One cannot make legislation on that basis and the fact that someone might regret it.  Again, the vast majority of people who have a transgender operation and have their gender recognised do not.  Perhaps a temporary certificate might be a way of getting around the issue in respect of younger teenagers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400008#G00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1382607900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will not take too long.

Today, the point was made about sport as well.  That is an issue I had not grasped.  Hormones can arise as an issue.  Perhaps Dr. Crowley could respond on access to sport in the context of preferred gender.<\/p><p>  We have reached the crux of the issue in terms of how the committee teases out the constitutional barriers and goes into detail which it must get from the Department of Social Protection.  It is clear that the requirement to divorce in order to have access to gender preference is not constitutionally sound.  We must examine how to deal with the matter.  Most people have asked that the provision on forced divorce would be deleted until the legislation on same-sex marriage is introduced.  Even then, it will be an issue in the intervening period and it must be examined.<\/p><p>  The matter of age has been addressed by the temporary certificate and how society would feel about such action being taken.  It has become more clear to me that 16 should be the age at which a young person can access the legal right to their preferred gender.  We are getting to the kernel of the legislation and the committee should take on board the points that have been made, in so far as that is possible.

I also welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  It is part of Ireland finally modernising itself in another important way.  I am a GP and I lead in the HSE on quality and patient safety.  In that role I have sought to work with transgender people to develop a better understanding with them of the issues the health service can meet and that it can sometimes create for transgender people.<\/p> <p>In that role I have sought to bring together the leading professional groups who can provide services, support and care to transgender people, with representatives from the transgender community, to ensure we get a more co-ordinated and better model of care.  The short answer to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's question is that we have services for transgender people.  I do not believe they are well co-ordinated at this point in time.  I do not believe they are numerous enough to be readily accessible, no more than other services we provide, but we are talking about services for transgender people today.<\/p><p> We fund a health and education officer to try to work with the transgender community on their own terms and support the community to advocate so that we can better meet their needs.  Overall, our role as a health service is to ensure that we understand the extent to which we can both guarantee and ensure the psychological well-being of transgender people and not harm it in any way.  We have issues about access to services.  There are delays to access services.  Some people choose not to access services.<\/p><p> The Deputy specifically mentioned surgery.  Currently, surgery is provided in the United Kingdom and we support and fund that provision.  The reason for that is, no more than other very specialist areas of care, we would want that surgery to be carried out to a very high level of quality and we do not believe the volume would develop a surgical team of that quality in Ireland.  We are very much at one with the transgender community in that understanding but if the situation changed and the volumes developed to an extent that we could develop a highly competent service here, we would examine that.<\/p><p> Taking up the point about sports and hormones, I am not an expert on hormones.  I understand an expert on hormones was before the committee yesterday but whatever we do we should seek again to look after the psychological well-being, normalisation and acceptance of transgender people.  Obviously, we should ensure that whatever role the medical profession is asked to play they play it to enable people to participate in sport in an agreed fashion, whatever is that fashion.  We must accelerate our work with the professional groupings to develop a co-ordinated model of care in partnership with the transgender people, and we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400008#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382608500,"counter":38,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il but I am not going to adjourn the meeting.

First, to pick up the baton from Dr. Crowley, in regard to sport, the International Olympic Committee has an evolving guideline on how to deal with questions of gender and gender identity in sport.  I did not address it because of time constraints but it seems mad in the extreme that we would bring in a legislative provision on sport that does not speak to the evolving guidelines those in the sporting community are developing.  It is particularly strange that we would bring in something whereby a person would be eligible to compete in the Olympics but not in the local national qualifying event that gets them to the Olympics.  That seems bats to me.<\/p><p>  I would recommend that if the Legislature feels the burning need to mention sport in this legislation, and the legislation would be no poorer if it were left it out, let it be something general along the lines of sporting organisations ought to be cognisant of best international practice, the evolving guidelines of the International Olympic Committee or some other nice reference like that.<\/p><p>  On the point Deputy Collins raised with Dr. Crowley about medical support treatments to wrap around children in particular, that is all very important and I do not disagree with it but that is a different conversation about the provision of services.  That is not a conversation about the access to legal rights.  S <i>v.<\/i> An Bord Ucht&aacute;la shows us the limitations of what happens when the conversation is not focused on the access to legal rights.  It means children cannot go to the local boys' or girls' school.  We need to have the conversations about accessing legal rights separate from the conversation about accessing medical treatment pathways.  As the new Commissioner, Thomas Hammarberg, has consistently reiterated, we must depathologise legal gender recognition.  We must not allow access to human rights and legal rights to be predicated on a person having a medical condition or a doctor saying that he or she has or has had a medical condition.  That is the second point.<\/p><p>  The third point is to respond regarding the temporary certificate.  I do not object to it as a type of comfort blanket for legislators if they want it but how is it different from a full gender recognition certificate?  I would point out that if it is not different in some meaningful way from a full gender recognition certificate, it is an act of discrimination against young people.  I want to make it very clear that we must know how it is different and if it is not different in a substantive and important way, and if it limits one's ability to access certain rights or does exactly what the full gender recognition certificate does, why have it?  What is the difference other than enshrining discrimination?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tanya N&iacute; Mhuirthile"},{"type":"speech","time":1382608500,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for attending.

I believe he is in the Gallery so I thank him for that.  We spoke in my office about everything the witnesses have spoken about, therefore, I have had questions answered.<\/p><p>  I told Mr. Giambrone that I had reservations about the age limit.  It is one of the biggest decisions anyone will ever make in their life.  I had reservations about those under 18 but the witnesses put up compelling arguments and I can see they are all singing from the same hymn sheet and are passionate about reducing the age limit.<\/p><p>  I was very concerned about the court case mentioned.  That poor man was left in limbo in that he is neither here nor there.  I find it strange, with medical technology, that the sex of a child cannot be determined at birth with ultrasound, MRI scans or whatever.  It is difficult to believe that a DNA sample can be taken from remains of someone who died hundreds of years ago but the sex of a child at birth cannot be determined.<\/p><p>  This issue is a subject for a range of committees from health, sport, social protection and education.  An issue we must examine is the impact of being a transgender student in a school environment.  I spoke to Mr. Broden Giambrone at length about that and what we can do as an education committee to put facilities in place because that situation can be awkward in a school environment.  Does the student use the boys' or the girls' toilet?  Is someone on the boys' or the girls' team?  It is the teachers who are faced with the decision and what do they have to do?  Guidelines should be put in place for schools that happen to have a transgender student.  I do not know the figures, but I am sure not every school will have a transgender student and therefore there is no need for panic about where we will get the funding, but if a child is transgender and they tell the principal, the principal should get onto the Department of Education and Skills.  There must be guidelines in place and funding allocated if needs be to provide even a private room for that child until the situation is sorted out.  <\/p><p>  We heard from Ms Catherine Cross at yesterday's meeting.

It is vital to have legal recognition of transgender and intersex individuals.  Two or three years ago, during the last term, this Oireachtas joint committee prepared a report on early school leaving and one group that was found to be at risk of early drop-out was that of transgender individuals.  As the witnesses have noted, they are at risk of much more harmful effects as a result.  In addition, it emerged clearly from the interviews conducted by members that sport was an issue.  This issue was not limited to transgender individuals but also affected homosexual individuals in those schools.  Consequently, I believe the joint committee should seek an amendment to the Bill that would make sport accessible, along the lines Dr. N&iacute; Mhuirthile mentioned, if international guidelines are place and if athletes are being rated.  I would argue that not many would want this because they already are at risk of dropping out because of the very fact of being transgender or because they are having difficulty living with who they are within the birth definition with which they came into the world.<\/p><p>  My question concerns the scenario in which parents do not consent in respect of those aged 16 or under.  It is understandable that parents would be fearful they might get it wrong.  Do the witnesses have empirical evidence of people getting it wrong if they did transition?  I am not talking about Ireland but worldwide.  For example, I am familiar with a parent two of whose children have declared they are gay.  She has absolutely and completely accepted this in the case of her son from the age of 17, and he now is 20.  However, she does not really accept that her daughter is gay.  The mother is fine about the possibility of her being gay or lesbian but she is not really clear, based on all the science.  The greatest fear I have been picking up from parents is that perhaps they are getting it wrong.

I also thank the witnesses for their brilliant presentations and for placing such expertise at members' disposal.  I will refrain from giving a speech on a topic that is very close to my heart, but I have specific questions to raise.  I do not know whether there have been many questions about this issue but my first set of questions pertains to the absence in these heads of Bill of an equality provision on the basis of transgender identity.  I note that FLAC, Dr. Ryan and the Equality Authority mentioned this, and perhaps they might comment a little further on it.  The witnesses may not have developed this issue much in the context of their submissions because it was not there, but perhaps the joint committee needs a little more information in this regard.  It sounds to me as though an opportunity may be missed in terms of placing such a provision within this Bill.  If not in this Bill, where should it go if, as law-makers, members agree it is necessary?  If it is not done now, when would it happen, and therefore why not do it now?  Moreover, do the witnesses believe the inclusion of this provision in this Bill would make sense legally as well as logically?  I ask particularly with regard to the policy objective of this law.  This is a set of questions to invite the witnesses to comment a little further if they wish.  They also may wish to submit a little more thought on this subject because I note that in its presentation yesterday, the Department indicated it was considering that.<\/p><p>  My second question is directed to Dr. Crowley, whom I thank for his attendance.  I noted a comment he has made previously which was extremely helpful, which is that he believes this law's primary objective ought to support the normalisation of the identity of transgender people and to support their psychological well-being.  That is such a fantastic principle, which I believe ought to be behind the Bill.  In light of that, can Dr. Crowley then comment on the requirement for evidence in the form of a statement from the treating physician being one of the requirements for gender recognition?  As several witnesses in the hearings today and yesterday effectively identified this requirement as a form of pathologising the identity, I invite Dr. Crowley to comment on that.  I have sought some legal opinion on the single status requirement and will not say too much as I will have an opportunity to speak to the joint committee about it later.  However, I have a question, if witnesses wish to comment a little further.  Ms Blackwell has eloquently outlined the disproportionality of the impact on a very small number of people of the requirement for a forced divorce and single status.  Moreover, there certainly is a huge difference of opinion as to whether this is needed in respect of constitutional compliance.  If one combines the ambiguity of that with the reality of the disproportionality with regard to human rights, is there then a stronger argument for not requiring single status?  I support the suggestion by Senator Power that perhaps there could be more exchange with the Department on this issue.  I also invite Dr. Ryan to comment a little on this issue because he is aware I remained silent on it in the Bill I introduced.  Both Dr. Ryan and Dr. N&iacute; Mhuirthile assisted in the preparation of that Bill and I invite them to comment briefly on the reason we chose that approach.  In other words, here is an alternative as an approach in law-making, as distinct from what is before members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400010#J00300","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1382609100,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I am aware that another vote will be called.

I ask the witnesses to comment on the reports they have received back from the area of education and the problems young people encounter.  As I stated,  I can imagine this, as I come from a secondary school background myself.  It has only been within the past ten years that young people have had the courage to come forward and talk about themselves and their bodies.  However, they face huge problems in school.  What supports are forthcoming from the Department of Education and Skills when someone comes forward?  I understand this may be moving away from the point of today's discussions, but it is important when discussing the age barrier of 18.

I have absolutely no objection whatsoever to transgender becoming a distinctive ground.  There is a great value in giving people a name in law.  This could be provided for in the Irish human rights and equality commission legislation which includes bringing in amendments to employment equality, equal status and human rights legislation together.  When trying to find an example of how the marriage element might work in practice, I did not find much in the law.  However, I did find provision for it in the Roman Catholic Church.  It is a requirement for a Roman Catholic priest to be celibate.  If an Anglican married priest decides to convert to Catholicism, his marriage is not dissolved, however.  If it can be accommodated there, I am sure we will find a way to accommodate it in this case.<\/p><p> There is good practice in third level education.

It is not necessarily the case that it would be unconstitutional to have a single status requirement.  It is arguable the courts would respect whatever decision is made in this area.  There is a strong argument that, given the divorce requirements are so tough in Ireland and potentially unmeetable in certain circumstances, the integrity of the family has been undermined so that the State would have to make a strong case to defend its approach.  It is important to note it is not necessarily the case that the Constitution precludes the Legislature from enacting legislation that would recognise equal marriage, specifically in this context or generally.  A strong argument has been made by many academics that the Oireachtas is perfectly entitled to enact equal marriage legislation and the courts would defer to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas may feel its hands are tied in enacting such legislation but, in fact, from case law it is likely the courts would defer.<\/p><p>  The European Court of Human Rights has stated that states have a margin of appreciation on the single status requirement.  Accordingly, the courts have tended to defer to states on whether they require people to be unmarried or not.  In Ireland, the argument can be made that because it is so difficult to divorce here the requirement of single status could potentially be disproportionate.  While Article 41 does not necessarily preclude the single status requirement, the courts would be likely to defer to the Oireachtas on whatever choice it makes in this area.  There is a strong argument, however, that the impact would be such that the approach would be disproportionate.  I do not believe a single status requirement is necessary or proportionate in this context.<\/p><p>  It is possible the marriages of transgender people could be annulled on various different grounds.  It is not the road to choose, however, as there are significant problems with annulment.  One has to deny there should ever have been a marriage in the first place and it precludes access to the various remedies one gets in divorce.  The fact parties are left high and dry in this area means we should not go down this route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102400011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergus Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382609700,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The officials who have developed this Bill have put a fantastic energy and commitment into developing the best Bill possible.

It is unusual for me to be seated on this side of the room rather than in the Visitors Gallery.  I thank the committee for its kind invitation to make a presentation to it and to discuss with members Estonia's experience within the European Union.  It is especially good to discuss this matter in a country which held the Presidency when Estonia and nine other successful candidate countries joined the Union.  As member may recall, the accession ceremony took place on a lovely sunny day in May 2004 at Farmleigh House in Dublin.  During its seventh Presidency earlier this year, Ireland brought in another new member state, namely, Croatia.  We can see from this that Ireland has adhered to the policy of enlargement and that it has delivered very nicely on the motto of its recent Presidency, that is, \"Stability, jobs and growth\".  In respect of the latter, I could refer to the EU budget, the adoption of the multi-annual finance framework, MFF, trade agreements, patent law, Common Agricultural Policy reforms, advancement on the digital single market and so on.<\/p><p>  The experience of my own country in the EU has been mostly positive.  We have learned and gained a great deal from our membership.  In essence, Estonia has become probably the most integrated country in the Nordic-Baltic region.  Estonia is a member of the EU, the eurozone, NATO, the OECD and the Schengen area.  It is not always recognised but our Government and people took clear decisions to join these.  Our positive experience within the EU may have led Estonia - the position may be the same for other member states - into what might be termed a comfort zone.  A great deal of rebuilding needs to be done in the context of the EU's structures and functions.  Not only must we be bear in mind that strategical issues in this regard, we are also obliged to engage in firefighting on a daily basis.  In such circumstances, our target is clear.  We must bring the European Union out of its comfort zone.  In that context, we should increase the level of responsibility among member states, enhance to rules that apply and strengthen the capacity of both the Union and the eurozone.  In essence, this is the Government of Estonia's view of what should happen in the EU in the coming years.<\/p><p>  It is not good for Estonia when Europe is tottering.  On the other hand, however, Ireland is recovering and this is good not only for other countries such as Portugal but also because it provides relief to the entire euro area.  It also provides encouragement to Estonia that even difficult issues relating to peripheral areas located to the very north and west of the Union can be resolved.<\/p><p>  What about the future?  It is not only the need to engage in firefighting which we must consider.  We must also examine ways in which the EU can be advanced in order that all of its citizens will be of the view that it continues to serve both the common interest and the needs of individual nations.  Let us consider what the future will bring in terms of sovereignty issues.  This matter will be debated in the context of the European Parliament elections to be held next spring.  Will individual states' sovereignty be lost or will sovereignty be shared or combined?  Our view is that most probably a combination of sovereignty through integration of our strengths in different fields might be one way to proceed.  Joint interests should be properly financed, represented and protected by the Union and what is not part of EU competences could be flexibility handled by member states.  A balance will have to be struck and I am glad all the nations are working to achieve this.<\/p><p>  Estonia is not protecting its own narrow national interests.  Instead, it is aiming to push policies that will give rise to higher growth and job creation, reduce barriers and advance European security.  We are very glad that the agenda relating to the single digital market was afforded high priority during Ireland's Presidency.  We see this as one of the areas in respect of which all member states - but, more particularly, the smaller ones - will benefit if barriers are removed and if services are allowed to flow, in a really free way, across internal European borders.  Public support for the European Union in Estonia is strong.  According to the most recent Eurobarometer survey, some 70% of Estonians consider themselves to be citizens of the European Union.  This means that the solid two-to-one majority achieved in the referendum on accession ten years ago remains intact.<\/p><p>  I believe I have covered the European issues.<\/p> <p>I would not be fair if I were to say that everything is rosy, but I am glad that we see advancements in some of the concerns - transport, connections from peripheral areas to the core, energy, the Common Agricultural Policy or Cohesion Funds.  I hope some expectations in those areas that have not been met during the almost first decade of membership will be addressed and dealt with under future Presidencies and successfully agreed multi-annual financial frameworks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"H.

Mr. Mait Martinson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382620500,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for their interest in Latvia's experience and for their kind invitation to participate in this meeting.  We all know that the EU is much more than just another international organisation.  Therefore, the experience of membership in the Union is rather complex and at the same time individual.<\/p><p>  I hope the committee will allow me to start with a small retrospection to say that Latvia&rsquo;s decision to move towards full membership of the EU was determined by geopolitical factors and by its own historical experience.  The Soviet occupation and annexation separated my country from other European nations for five decades and soon after the restoration of national independence in 1991, Latvia started to build a modern democratic society seeking security and prosperity through close co-operation with the existing European and Euro-Atlantic structures, namely, NATO, the OSCE, the European Free Trade Association which existed at that time, and above all, the European Union.  In the 1990s the EU gradually became the most dynamic and powerful European structure embarking on an ambitious policy of enlargement.  Inevitably, Latvia decided to follow the general trend which prevailed in the whole of central and eastern Europe and decided to adopt the European socio-economic model, applying for membership in the EU soon after.<\/p><p>  I would like to structure my short presentation today along three main vectors, namely, the political, economic and societal impact of Latvia&rsquo;s accession to the EU.  Before identifying the advantages attained, it is necessary to remind one that Latvia implemented significant reforms and benefited from EU assistance even before accession.  Approximation of legislation and transposition of EU norms happened on the basis of the association agreement concluded in 1995 and, more importantly, in the process of negotiations on the accession agreement.  Those negotiations started in 2000.<\/p><p>  In the economic dimension, the EU is rightly considered as one of the most important resources for the social and economic development of my country.  The EU provided significant support to Latvia&rsquo;s infrastructure and economy through its structural funds, the Cohesion Fund and the Common Agricultural Policy.  For example, in the financial framework for 2007 to 2013, Latvia received &euro;4.5 billion through the acquisition of EU funds and &euro;1.8 billion more under the CAP.  I remind members that the annual GDP figure in Latvia for the year 2010 was just &euro;22 billion.  That means that almost 5% of our GDP was drawn from EU structural policies.<\/p><p>  The accession to the EU made Latvia part of the Single Market.  I remind members that the reorientation of foreign trade was a major task of my government back in the 1990s when Latvia sought to reduce its dependence on the Eurasian markets.  At present, in 2013, a total of 70% of Latvia&rsquo;s exports and 77% of its imports come from the EU.  Needless to say, Latvia has adopted all the relevant quality and safety standards and norms that facilitate our co-operation with EU partners and also our trade with third countries.<\/p><p>  Membership of the EU opened therefore the introduction of the single currency.  The economic and financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 delayed Latvia&rsquo;s accession to the eurozone by several years but at present all the criteria have been fulfilled and Latvia is about to introduce the euro on 1 January 2014, thus obtaining an even more favourable environment for investment and trade.<\/p><p>  On the societal impact, individuals and society as a whole have greatly benefitted from Latvia&rsquo;s membership.  The major issues are improved standards of environmental protection, access to education and health services in all EU member states, EU support for youth and the integration of society in Latvia.  Many Latvians made use of the opportunities offered by the free movement of individuals and labour force in the EU.  Almost 300,000 people out of a total population of 2.2 million have travelled abroad to work or study.  A total of 50,000 Latvians have come to Ireland for shorter or longer stays.  The current number of Latvians residing in Ireland is approximately 25,000.  My compatriots contribute to the local economy and also benefit from the Irish social system in full accordance with existing legislation.<\/p><p>  A separate but no less important issue is the beneficial effect of membership on the development of the Latvian language and culture.  Today, the Latvian language functions as a fully fledged official language of the EU.  The population of Latvia profits from cultural exchanges with other European nations.<\/p><p>  Next, I will deal with the political impact.  In 2004, Latvia became a full participant in the EU decision-making process, significantly amplifying its political influence on internal and external policies of the Union and the functioning of European institutions.  The new situation changed the horizon of domestic policy-making.  Before the accession, Latvia was much less concerned with such global challenges as climate change, safety of energy supply, global competitiveness, migration, international terrorism and other such issues.  After 2004, Latvia had put itself into a much wider international context, addressing many issues and challenges.  Participation in the common foreign and security policy and the European scrutiny and defence policy was a major aspect of that process.  A small nation could not conduct intensive political and economic relations with all the countries of the world on its own.  Now, according to the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, the European External Action Service and the European Commission provide us with much broader outreach.<\/p><p>  Having touched on external relations I wish to add a few words on security.  We cannot overlook the security dimension.  While recognising the fact that the EU is by no means a defence alliance, my country highly values the solidarity clause enshrined in Article 222 of the Lisbon treaty.  That also provides us with a perspective for the future and there are many issues on which to work.  I will conclude my presentation and I am ready to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400004#C00200","nonspeaker":"H.

I welcome our guests and thank them for their presentations.  Mr. Martinson referred to two issues that are very important for smaller countries within the European Union, namely, sovereignty and the digital economy.  Sovereignty is something we can make and break ourselves, in that our contribution to the sum total of what the European Union is will, in many ways, determine our sovereignty.  If we stand aloof from the Union - if we do not engage with it - that tends to undermine our sovereignty to a far greater extent than embracing the Union.  Indeed, those countries that have embraced the Union to a greater extent have lost less sovereignty than those which took the opposite position.  Having said that, loss of sovereignty is in essence mythical because it is really a case of countries coming together to share their sovereignty for the common good.  That can only be a good thing.<\/p><p>  Regarding the digital economy, there are tremendous opportunities in that area for countries at the periphery of the Union, which include Latvia, Estonia and Ireland.  Technology being what it is, it is possible to set up industry and create employment in smaller areas with less infrastructural investment.  It is something in which all member states can engage.<\/p><p>  The Single Market has several very interesting aspects.  It has, however, been something of a two-edged sword in that, as well as the free movement of goods, people and services, we have seen how greater supervision and regulation in regard to the movement of money would have served us well in the past ten years.  This is true for all member states and the Union in general.  It is not possible to have a population of 500 million people and allow the totality of freedom to dictate where investment takes place and where money will go.  There has to be a balancing factor.  I sincerely hope we have learned that lesson.<\/p><p>  In regard to alternative energy and its benefits, to what extent have both the ambassadors' countries managed to promote interest in such initiatives?

One of the narratives we often hear in Ireland is that power in Europe is essentially held by Germany and strongly influenced by one or two other countries.  As three of the smallest countries in Europe, as well as being on the periphery, there is an onus on Ireland, Estonia and Latvia to build strong relationships.  Deputy Bernard Durkan is correct that the countries which engage most within Europe get the most from the Union.  The public should be made more aware that the sum of the smaller countries working together can potentially significantly outweigh the power concentrated in one or two large ones.  I hope our countries continue to develop a strong working relationship.<\/p><p>  In regard to how Europe is perceived within the ambassadors' countries, Mr. Martinson indicated that the latest information indicates that support for membership in his country is running at 70% or thereabouts.  Can Mr. Apals provide the same information for Latvia?  I am aware that each country is at different stages of the process in terms of participation in the eurozone.  Estonia came in at probably the worst time.  Will Mr. Martinson indicate how it is working out?  Mr. Apals might indicate the perception in Latvia as his country prepares to join the eurozone in January.

If I had no time limit, I could keep talking forever.  Deputy Bernard Durkan asked about the extent to which we have embraced the Union.  We have certainly seen a rather quick change in that Estonia became a member state during the boom years in the early part of the last decade.  People questioned whether we should join at that time.  We have learned through the turbulence which followed that embracing the core values gives us a voice around the table.  It is up to oneself how one builds relationships and alliances with similar thinking partners from near and far.  Fortunately, Ireland is not considered a faraway place for Estonia.<\/p><p>  Regarding the digital economy, this is an issue on which the European Council is very much concentrating.  I am pleased we have established a good link to different Irish players, be it through our dealings with the chief information officer appointed by the Irish Government or via other channels.  We expect significant numbers at the forthcoming web summit and cyber security conference.  It is an opportunity to show what we have experienced and to see what we can do together.<\/p><p>  This takes me to Deputy Dara Murphy's question regarding bilateral engagement.  At some point during the financial difficulties and cutbacks of recent years, the question arose as to whether we really need embassies.  Do we need to travel to so many European capitals or would Brussels and Strasbourg do the job?  By now, we know and understand that businesses get built up by having a cup of coffee with a counterpart, whether in Tallinn, Riga or Helsinki; by having lunch with fellows and seeing that, yes, we can do business with them which will benefit both sides.<\/p> <p>As for the euro experience, it is good.

They see people in Finland getting &euro;3,000 per month, whereas the equivalent rate in Estonia might be &euro;1,000 per month.  This raises questions from the people on the street as to the reason it is so different.  However, one has no time to explain that Sweden has not had wars for three centuries, etc., and that consequently, the basis is different.<\/p><p>  On the last point regarding energy and interconnections, we are very glad that we now have had two interconnections built to Finland - the second one will be finished.  As for green energy, it mostly is wind energy.  Unless I am mistaken, we are at the top of the European Union in adopting green energy policies and right now, there is even talk in some other member states that perhaps we have over-invested in green policies but we will see.  I might get the figure wrong but right now I think we are getting approximately 7% of our electricity needs in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400006#E00300","nonspeaker":"H. E. Mr. Mait Martinson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382621700,"counter":75,"content":"<p>If I may respond briefly to the questions raised by members of the joint committee, I will touch upon several issues.  The first concerns regulation of financial flows and services.  Here, I must state the reasons for the financial crisis in Latvia are very similar to the reasons for the financial crisis in Ireland.  As many economists will state these days, the crisis arose because a small economy was overwhelmed by an influx of very cheap money.  That also influenced the consumption patterns of people, as well as increasing the real estate and mortgage prices.  At a certain point, when the cheap money became more expensive or was no longer available, the crisis began at that moment.  This also was a very serious issue for my country.  However, I believe the European Union is now taking the right steps to introduce regulation and controls through a banking union and the European institutions are working hard on this issue.  From the perspective of Latvia, this would be the right way to address the issues, namely, through regulation at the European level, again because a small nation is subject to big flows of finance.  On the other hand, a small nation cannot necessarily put restrictions on or regulate these flows.  This should be done by the banking union at a much higher level because through the Single Market and the four freedoms of movement, we are all interconnected.<\/p><p>  The second question concerned energy and alternative energy sources.  Alternative energy should play a much bigger role in the future because the supply of hydrocarbons is not unlimited.  In addition, alternative energy would provide a much cleaner environment.  In my country, we are working on these issues using both wind energy and to an even larger extent, the vast resources of wood.  Our situation today is not comparable with that which obtained a decade ago.  These days, every single piece of wood is utilised.  It is not discarded but is utilised to produce heating pellets and everything else.  In our region, one could regard wood as processed energy of the sun.  We do not use solar panels as much because there is not enough sunshine but we certainly can use wood as a resource for production, heating and everything else.  Consequently, alternative energy plays a big role.  However, at this point alternative energy still cannot entirely replace traditional sources of energy.  There are many discussions, plans and projects in the region, one such project being the construction of a nuclear power plant.  There is also the question of building liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals, which would provide these rather small countries with supplies of LNG coming from abroad and thereby reducing dependence on Russian gas pipelines, which I must note still exists.  Interconnection concerning electricity is of course very important.  In the case of Latvia, we have interconnection with Sweden, from which we receive electricity produced by hydropower plants and by nuclear power plants.<\/p><p>  The next question I wish to address is the working relationship between small nations.  Perhaps I did not emphasise sufficiently the fact that small nations become much more influential in European structures.  Our influence in European Union decision-making is not entirely proportional to our size but is much bigger.  Therefore, we can build alliances, address common issues and use these structures to promote our shared interests.  Again, however, the configuration of such alliances differs from case to case depending on one's geographical position or economic situation.  There are important fields in which the unanimity rule still prevails and here I will mention the common foreign and security policy, CFSP, and the European security and defence policy, ESDP, in which all countries must agree to a decision, meaning that sovereignty in these important sectors is retained by the nation states.<\/p><p>  As for the introduction of the euro, I will comment briefly by repeating that in our view, the euro is not a technocratic project.  I have already made reference to the geopolitical considerations that are equally important.  One should probably state there are integration processes both in Europe and in Eurasia.  From our perspective, introducing the euro would anchor our economy in the European market.  That means the introduction of the euro would both facilitate investment and trade with European nations and would tie our economy to the European markets, which is a very important consideration.  Moreover, if one considers the issue of financial stability, there have been many pressures to devalue the national currency, which my Government has resisted successfully.  Now, the introduction of the euro is certainly a guarantee for financial stability in the future because of course one cannot talk of devaluation of the euro.  That would be a global issue and Latvia will be part of the eurozone and then of course will function according to its rules.  <\/p><p>  On the last question concerning parliamentary co-operation, my country greatly values the parliamentary co-operation between Latvia and Ireland.  Already this year, a delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade came to Latvia and I now have been informed that a delegation from this joint committee is visiting my capital city in less than ten days.  We greatly value these contacts because European institutions have very broad competences but at the same time, these competences are limited both in a sectoral sense and to a certain number of people who attend meetings in Brussels or who work there.  This probably has a slightly wider dimension.  It is known that many mass media would raise the issue of the deficits of democracy in the European Union.  The way to address this deficit of democracy probably is through involvement of national parliaments and through direct contacts between national parliaments discussing wider European issues.  In addition to these contacts, I would also emphasise the importance of people-to-people contacts.  The average person or citizen should have much broader contacts with representatives of other European countries and without such foundations, the European Union probably will continue to suffer from the deficit of democracy that is claimed by some observers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400006#E00400","nonspeaker":"H.

I was fascinated by the Chairman&rsquo;s question on migration from Latvia to here and the ambassador&rsquo;s response to that.  My colleague on my side here pointed out there has been a significant number of marriages between the Latvian population here and Irish people.  This suggests the ambassador&rsquo;s hope that they may go home again might be thwarted.<\/p><p>  This week the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Pascal Donohoe, in a separate address said shared sovereignty is enhanced sovereignty.  If we pool our sovereignties, then we enhance them to work for each other&rsquo;s mutual benefit.  If one cannot share one&rsquo;s sovereignty, it only leads to insecurity and xenophobia.  It is important the smaller member states work together.  We have a community of interests in the EU among the smaller member states which should be maintained when it comes to budget and other negotiations, as we need to rely on each other.<\/p><p>  Never again should it happen that the ordinary taxpayer, the regular normal folk on the streets, pay the brunt of future banking crises as they did the last time.  If we have another bubble in our economy with a subsequent collapse of the banking system, it cannot be tolerated that regular folk who work in factories or the myriad of shops should have to bear the brunt of it, and for generations, with diminished services and incomes as a result.  Responsibilities must be taken on board by bondholders, bank shareholders and depositors in some instances.  The last place we should turn to in future is the first place we turned the last time, to the ordinary people.  That was wrong and is something smaller member states could work on as a community.<\/p><p>  I compliment our professional backup people here for the comprehensive and interesting briefing material on Latvia.  I note Latvia has a list system for its elections.  During a casual lunch with colleagues the other day, some were bemoaning the proportional representation system and multi-seat constituencies as creating too much internal competition and useless activity among Members.  While I personally do not agree with this, how does the list system work for Latvia and would the ambassador commend it for Ireland?  My instincts are against it because it smacks of elitism and has risks of centralisation and favouritism which could all lead to a democratic deficit.

I will do my best to answer the other questions that were posed.<\/p><p>  On the comment to the effect that some members of the Latvian community have an ambition to return home, this is currently an official policy of my Government.  We have adopted an reintegration plan to facilitate and help those who would like to return to their country of origin to do so.  At the same time, we realise that a significant part of the Latvian community here will remain in Ireland for a long time.  In this context, we should simply learn from the Irish experience in terms of how we should work with our diaspora.  We know there are very important forums are discussing this matter in Ireland at present.  The Irish diaspora could be play a vital role with regard to the development of this country's economy in the future, even though its members may never return here to live.  We should, therefore, consider encouraging broader co-operation and retaining contacts with members of our community in Ireland, even those who are going to remain here for a longer period than they initially expected.  After all, those to whom I refer are all EU citizens and they enjoy the relevant economic, social and political rights.  Many of them have already or will become Irish citizens.  Even those who choose not to do so still have full access to the rights to which I refer because they are European citizens.  Among those rights is that which allows them to vote in local and European elections.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the Eastern Partnership.  In the context of Latvia's priorities for 2015 - when it will hold the Presidency of the Council of the EU - specifically in the area of the common foreign and security policy, CFSP, our foreign minister has identified two major priorities.  The first of these relates to the development and promotion of the Eastern Partnership and the second would involve closer relations with central Asian countries.  On the Eastern Partnership, the summit in Vilnius will probably address the issue of Ukraine's association agreement.  There will be another Eastern Partnership summit in 2015 and this will be hosted by Latvia.  I will take the liberty of expressing a personal view at this point and state that we will have an opportunity to further develop the Eastern Partnership at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400008#G00200","nonspeaker":"H.

We do not believe, for example, that the current objectives of the partnership could be realised very soon and that it should then stop operating.  We hope that this initiative will continue to evolve and develop.<\/p><p>  On the question of Russian minorities in Latvia and the recommendation that their rights should be respected and enhanced, the integration of society is, again, a policy which my country has been pursuing since the early 1990s.  While the presence of a large number of people who arrived from the former Soviet Union when my country was under soviet rule is a reality, successive governments of Latvia have done their best to integrate these individuals into Latvian society.  However, our approach is strictly individual.  If we are discussing this matter in the context of EU treaties and agreements, I remind everyone that these treaties refer to the rights of persons belonging to national minorities.  There is no such thing as collective rights of minorities in the EU treaties.  This is also the basis of the approach of my Government.  We will do everything to guarantee the full rights of every individual.  At this moment, however, we are probably not talking of collective rights because there is also a problem with the definition of minority.  There is no single definition in that regard in Europe.  The obligation of my Government under international treaties and commitments is to guarantee the rights of every person.  Of course, naturalisation is available to any long-term resident of Latvia.  Any person who has resided in Latvia can apply for citizenship.  The naturalisation procedure is quite simple.  There is a very simple test in the Latvian language, which is the only official language in the country.  There is also a very basic test of a person's knowledge of Latvia's constitution and its history.  That is all.<\/p><p>  The question regarding what can be done to further enhance the position of Russian speakers in my country is, in my opinion, quite easily answered.  We could promote integration at individual level and that is being done and will continue to be done.  Concerning the broader definition in respect of the Russian community in my country, this is an extremely difficult issue.  Even Russian people in Latvia do not define themselves as a single minority.  Many individuals would rather refer to a Russian-speaking minority, which comprises those who speak Russian as their first language.  Again, this is a very peculiar definition.  I could regard myself as a Russian speaker because Russian was probably my first foreign language.  In such circumstances I could pose a question as to whether I am a member of the Russian-speaking community.  I will conclude my rather lengthy comments on this matter by stating that the existing policy of Latvia has been recognised by all international organisations and by many international experts.  When Latvia was in the process of joining the EU, the Union concluded that my country had fulfilled its obligations in the field of human rights.  That was a precondition of our membership in 2004.  The same position has been taken by other international organisations, be it the United Nations or the OSCE.  Many experts have come to Latvia to observe the situation on the ground and advise my Government on the improvement of legislation.  This co-operation will continue into the future.<\/p><p>  The next question related to sovereignty.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Reilly that shared sovereignty is enhanced sovereignty.  The structure of the EU has traditionally based on three pillars and the third pillar - which relates to the CFSP and the European security and defence policy, ESDP - involves specific provisions.  Under the Lisbon treaty, we accepted majority rule and qualified majority voting in the first two pillars.  This does not mean that we will now broaden our sovereignty and embark on nationalisation policies.  These matters are probably the subject of public debate in some EU member states.<\/p><p>  The final question related to the Latvian electoral system.  The list system was inherited from the constitution adopted in 1922.  As members may know, Latvia decided to restore its national independence on the basis of the same constitution.  This decision provided us with legal continuity.  Latvia is not a new state; it was proclaimed and recognised in 1918.  Our state is a continuation of that which was proclaimed in 1918 and, as a result, the constitution and our electoral law remain valid.<\/p> <p>The constitution and electoral law, therefore, remain solid.  There is broad public debate about what can be done to improve the electoral system.  There have not been many recommendations thus far to move away from the list system but the debate is ongoing on how to improve it.  A citizen can express his or her views by a preferential vote to give a preference to one candidate on the list over another.  The broader debate about our political system is centred on the current parliamentary system versus the introduction of a presidential system or a mixed system.  This debate is not so much about the list system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400008#G00400","nonspeaker":"H.

The route should be finalised by the end of 2015 and, everything going to plan, we expect the real work to commence two years after that.  We still face several hurdles, including different views on the route.

In Ireland, people with different backgrounds bring something with them and it is up to the nation and the society to figure out how to benefit from their knowledge and differences.  They can enrich the range of possibilities.  The most sought after workforce in Estonia are people in their late 20s who speak at least three languages.

They are seen by employers as offering more advantages than their Estonian compatriots because they can work simultaneously with the north, east and the west.<\/p><p>  We mainly construct electricity lines over ground but that is an ongoing debate.  The facilities to produce electricity and transfer lines have been separated so that different operators control them.  The bills are growing longer because one pays for 13 different lines, as well as crane taxes, and so forth.  We are in a unique position in regard to fossil fuels because we use oil shale.  This is a strange product to dig out but it is different to shale oil.  Some 90% of our electricity is produced from oil shale.  As it has less energy value than coal, it is in our interest to find a proper balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013102400009#H00900","nonspeaker":"H.

Members will, no doubt, be acutely aware that the economic downturn in this part of the island has necessarily resulted in the cancellation or curtailment of many plans and projects that were to be funded from the public purse.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the national roads improvement programme, which has seen the NRA's funding reduced by 83% from peak levels, and halved between 2012 and 2013 alone.  In real terms, the authority has had to deal with a reduction from a peak of more than &euro;1.5 billion to approximately &euro;280 million this year.  It is a case of having to cut our cloth to measure and, consequently, our scope for undertaking major improvement works on our national road network, which comprises more than 5,500 km of carriageway, is now extremely limited.  Unfortunately, this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  During the period from December 1999, when the British-Irish Agreement came into force, to 2010 the authority's national roads programme was largely focused, in line with Government policy, on the development of motorway links between Dublin and the major cities on the island, namely, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Belfast.  The M1 motorway from Dublin to the Border was the first of these major interurban motorways to be completed in its entirety.  Coupled with the improvements implemented by Transport Northern Ireland from the Border to Belfast, the construction of this high quality corridor linking the two principal cities on the island has brought significant time savings, reduced transport costs and enhanced safety for road users.  An important element of the Dublin to Belfast project was the construction of the A1-M1 Newry to Dundalk dual carriageway scheme, which was jointly managed and was a model of co-operation between the authority, Transport Northern Ireland and the local authorities involved.  I am pleased to say that, through our experience of working together on the A1-M1 project and through our contacts on other road schemes of mutual interest, the NRA and Transport Northern Ireland have established a close and positive working relationship.<\/p><p>  The authority's major interurban programme in the period to 2010 has not been undertaken at the exclusion of other routes.  We were able to complete a number of major schemes which have provided significant time saving and safety benefits for users of other road corridors, including the main cross-Border routes.  Examples of these include the N2-A5 road, which saw the construction of bypasses to Carrickmacross, Monaghan and Castleblaney, as well as the motorway link from the M50 to the north of Ashbourne.  The M3 Dublin-Ballyshannon route saw the completion of 60 km of new motorway from Clonee to the north of Kells, while the N4 Dublin-Sligo route, which connects to Enniskillen via the N16 and Donegal via the N15, also benefited from several major improvement schemes.  Motorists can now enjoy the benefits of dual carriageway standards from Mullingar to Dublin.<\/p><p>  As I noted in my opening remarks, given the fiscal constraints under which we currently operate there is limited scope for the authority to develop and implement the many national road improvement works required not only in Border regions but throughout the country.  We are nevertheless progressing planning work on a number of important schemes so that we are in a position to commence construction as soon as funding allows.  One such scheme is the section of the N4 between Castlebaldwin and Collooney and we expect the scheme proposal to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval shortly.  The N14 Letterkenny-Lifford and the N15 Lifford-Stranorlar projects have been brought through the preliminary design stage but unfortunately we will not be in a position to bring the schemes concerned to compulsory purchase order stage until funding permits.  Meanwhile, the bypasses at Belturbet, County Cavan, on the N3 have been partially open to traffic since August and the entire scheme is scheduled for completion early next year.  In regard to the N14-A5 link, members will no doubt be aware of the position regarding the development of the A5 in Northern Ireland.  In the event that the project proceeds, we will be engaging with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in the context of the State investment for the project.<\/p><p>  I welcome members' questions and further exploration of the issues I have discussed or any other issues that they care to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1382605800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Barry and his colleague, Mr. Nolan.  The landscape of our national routes has changed dramatically over the past decade.  The establishment of the National Roads Authority was pivotal to the co-ordination of the work undertaken.  Many people in our area of public life refer to every statutory and semi-State agency as a quango but the NRA is not a quango.  It has been extremely important to the development of necessary infrastructure.  I am not being parochial if I dwell on two or three issues because I represent two of the Southern Ulster counties.  The first issue is the N2 from Clontibret to the Border at Aughnacloy, where it links with the A5.<\/p> <p>A 400 m wide corridor has been identified for this in County Monaghan.  The next stage is preliminary design stage one, which would reduce the width of the corridor and give some certainty to landowners in that region.  It is a cause of concern to people, particularly farmers who may see their holdings bisected.  My understanding, based on information from Monaghan County Council, is that it would cost &euro;1.5 million to advance the project to the next stage.  We fully appreciate what Mr. Barry said about the funding challenges but we must put in place the plans, proposals and advanced preparatory work as much as possible.  The Monaghan county manager, Mr. David Fallon, and the then mayor made a very strong presentation here along with their counterparts from North of the Border on the critical role this development can play in development of the north east and the north west of our country and the Chairman's own county.<\/p><p> Some preliminary design work on the Cavan-Dundalk route is nearing completion, particularly the section from Cootehill to Shercock, Carrickmacross and Dundalk.  The designers have rightly and prudently segmented the route into short stand-alone projects, which will cost approximately &euro;2 million each.  Thankfully, there is a fair bit of commerce and economic activity along that route.  It is important for products going to Greenore Port and Dundalk.  I am anxious that this project be advanced through planning.  I appreciate the funding pressures, but Cavan, Monaghan and Louth County Councils have sought funding for the further advancement of the planning process through strategic regional and local road grants or through the specific road improvement grant schemes.  It gives the opportunity to do segments of the route.<\/p><p> The N54 Cavan-Clones-Monaghan Town route is of particular concern to the people of Monaghan.  There is a huge amount of traffic on that road and much traffic between the two general hospitals in Cavan and Monaghan.  We talk about developing east-west.  The route connecting Belfast, Monaghan, Cavan, Athlone and Galway encompasses different sections of the M1, A3, N12, N54 and N55.  If further development and preparatory work can be done on that route, it would be using major sections of our road that are already upgraded or new routes.  Those routes are extremely important for the economic and social development of that Border region.  This would enhance the east-west economic development we want to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400003#D00400","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382606400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Barry and the NRA.

My other question is a north-south Galway issue, the Gort to Tuam road, which is part of the Atlantic corridor.  This road is very badly needed and is a priority for the NRA.

We are very aware, from representations from Deputies, officials and the public, that very wide corridors are disruptive and can sometimes be there for a very long time.  We are mindful of that.  We have very little discretionary money next year.  While our budgets might sound significant, the moneys are already committed.  We have unpaid bills for old projects that are open.  We have commitments against PPP schemes which must be paid.  Next year we are unlikely to begin any new planning activities and very unlikely to start any new schemes on the ground other than PPP schemes.<\/p><p>  We are aware of the value of segmenting projects and doing them in smaller sections.  Many Deputies will have seen that last year and this year we have had very few big projects but many smaller ones.  Given that the funding will not be there for the big schemes for a few years, we have identified the worst bottlenecks, bends and realignments.  We have done a series of projects, some only half a kilometre or two kilometres long, to make the very best use of the money available to us.  We have more of those schemes in the planning process but we do not have the money to start building them next year.  We will get to them as soon as we can.  The money spend on those smaller schemes or on subsections of schemes is probably giving the best value to the public for moneys that might be spent on improvement.  Despite our agreement with Deputy Smith on the routes he mentioned, the funding for this coming year will not allow us to do much with them.<\/p><p>  It is well known that the European Court took a decision that led to the quashing of approval for  the Galway outer bypass.

It will take the council until the end of next year or early 2015 to get a new application into An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Getting approval will be a long drawn-out process.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to send its comments and recommendations to the European Commission, so that will take a few years to get through the process with no guarantee of success.  Nonetheless, we all recognise that Galway city is the last of the cities that has not yet been bypassed.  The congestion there from one side of the town to the other is ridiculous at any time.  We will do what we can to address it, but I cannot see it getting through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the European Commission in fewer than several years.

If An Bord Plean&aacute;la is generally well-disposed to the scheme and accepts the arguments made, it will send its views to the European Commission.  I do not know how long the European Commission will take, but given how bureaucracies work it is unlikely it will take less than a year.  I do not have a timeline.  We are in new space.

I am very keen to ensure no excuses are left open for people not to work on that.<\/p><p>  What preparatory work, if any, is taking place around the Narrow Water Bridge?  There are concerns in the North that some of the excuses that were used to delay, stall and question might disrupt the connectivity around Omeath and that the bridge might be built but it would be a bridge to nowhere.  What plans are in place to create or widen roads?  We heard of significant local objections because people felt they would be overrun on narrow roadways.<\/p><p>  I am usually upstaged - today is no different - by Deputy Feighan, who basically stole my thunder.  I am concerned about the Belfast to Galway route via Enniskillen and Sligo, which is very important for that part of the country.  We have got as far as Ballygawley and need to get to Enniskillen on the Northern side - we will get there sooner rather than later.  While the route from Enniskillen to Sligo is very scenic, it needs to be taken slowly.  While it may not be on the top of it, that route needs to go on the list somewhere.  In raising those points, I fully accept there is a financial difficulty and I would be factoring that in.  Are we talking about five, ten, 20 or 30 years down the road, or in our lifetime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400005#F01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1382607000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il, but we have a few minutes in which Mr. Berry can reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400005#F01300","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382607000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I was asked about meetings with our counterparts in Northern Ireland.

We have done the preliminary design work on the routes but the work is not going any further for the same reasons I gave earlier.  The traffic is heavy.  The return on investment is very strong.  Even taken in isolation these schemes have strong economic returns well in excess of the cost of the routes.  The fact that they will link into the A5 adds to the benefits they provide.  We are keen to do the work, however, these routes are in the same limbo as most of the other routes.  We have approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the work on our side of the river crossing, with the design for the new bridge approved and the linkage arrangements are ready to go with the A5 at Strabane.

This means so much to the people in Moneygall and in the wider region.  I applaud his decision.<\/p><p>  I refer to the sad fate of the Dublin-Derry economic corridor.  I have spoken about this issue many times at this forum.  On Monday of this week a total of &pound;115 million was reallocated which had been earmarked for the upgrading of the Dublin-Derry corridor.  This project is now stationary.  I believe it is probably one of the most important infrastructural developments in the country and is needed for the economic and social welfare of the people who live on the corridor between Dublin and Derry.  It takes three and a half hours to get from Dublin to Derry.  It is the most tiring and stressful route in the country.  It is now much quicker to travel between Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  It used to take nearly a day to get to Cork.  Mr. Barry said the Derry to Dublin route was in limbo.  The development of this route has now gone into limbo.  I raised this issue at a previous meeting.  I believe sincerely and passionately that Monaghan County Council should be allocated &euro;1.5 million to prepare for the planning and there should be a definite indication of where the road will be.  If the funding for the road is provided sooner rather than later, it will be necessary to go through this process.  Pre-planning should be done so that when the funding becomes available to the NRA the project can go ahead.  In my view it is an appalling lack of action that the Government cannot come up with &euro;1.5 million.  I do not wish this to be a criticism of my colleagues in the Government party but in my view there is a lack of commitment.<\/p><p>  I hope the Chairman, Deputy McHugh, does not mind me saying it, but in my view the Government is not engaged adequately with what is happening in the North.  High-level meetings have always been held but I do not think there is any thrusting energy going into maintaining the peace process by means of economic development.  The Northern Government and its representatives on this committee have also slipped up in this regard, because it is also in their bailiwick.  I have very passionate views on this issue.  The Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement do not seem to matter a damn, and this road is just lying there.  I cannot understand it because so much depends on this road.  The biggest issue in the North is employment creation, and here is an opportunity to develop the road and the infrastructure.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Andy Pollak has set up a new project to develop a form of cross-Border economic development unique to the Irish Border region.  Its aim is to create a Border development zone.  This innovative research and conference project will explore the potential of the joint economic development approach across the whole Irish and Northern Irish cross-Border region.<\/p> <p>I am not being too personal but my husband chairs this in a voluntary capacity.  Many people are very excited about this development, and they are dedicated and sincere about the development of cross-Border regions.

I assumed until recently that they were a priority so when were they deprioritised?  We have debates about them recently.  There were also plans to develop the Ballynacarrick bridge linking south Armagh and County Monaghan.  Could we get an update on where that project stands?  There is a question of funding for projects, many of which have been put on the backboiler.

I welcome Mr. Barry and Mr. Nolan.  I met Mr. Barry in the past when I spoke to him about an issue relating to the N4, particularly the stretch from Colloney to Castlebaldwin.  I acknowledge that the issue was helped along the way and it got to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval under an environmental impact statement compulsory purchase order.  Perhaps Mr. Barry could update us that.  When I travel every week from Sligo to Dublin, I can see the motorway, and the stretch from Mullingar to Dublin was mentioned.  A new part was recently opened.  People in my constituency have serious difficulty commuting from Sligo to Castlebaldwin to Boyle, for example, and there is also the potential to bring entrepreneurs and investors to Sligo.  When they see the 27 or 29 white crosses along the route from Castlebaldwin to Colloney, it indicates there is a major issue.  They highlight the number of fatalities that have taken place over a number of years.  There is a committee working well with Sligo County Council to try to resolve these issues.  Mr. Barry has indicated that motorways were completed during the boom years but the poor relation has been the N4 to Sligo.<\/p><p>  There is also an issue with the N16.  There have been negotiations between the National Roads Authority and Leitrim County Council about phase 2 of the N16 at Cornacloy to Sradrine.  The matter was discussed and there is funding for additional works to be carried out.  Will the witness provide an update on that?  Sligo County Council is required to develop a proposal for a minor on-line realignment scheme and the matter is with the NRA.  It is the worst section of the N16, from approximately the townland of Lugnagall to the Sligo-Leitrim county boundary at Gortnagrelly.  I am sure the witnesses are familiar with it as I had a meeting with officials from Sligo County Council, who are very concerned because the N16 forms part of the east-west corridor linking Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, or more specifically, linking Sligo and much of Connacht in the west with Belfast, Larne and Dundalk on the east coast.  The EU has designated the road as an east-west link forming part of the trans-European road network.  A route selection process for the section within County Sligo around Glencar was carried out in the mid 1990s and Sligo County Council is now attempting to develop a proposal involving a minor on-line realignment scheme of 3 km of the worst section of the existing N16.  It heads from Lugnagall to the Sligo-Leitrim county border at Gortnagrelly.<\/p><p>  I am highlighting these serious issues for cross-Border co-operation.  The volume of traffic has increased substantially on this route over a number of years and it is vital that the NRA takes the responsibility to prioritise these roads, and particularly the areas of which I have spoken.

As Deputy McLoughlin has stated, the Sligo side has a couple of very bad bends and it is important to get an update on what is happening in that respect.<\/p><p>  The N4 is very important to all of us and the Dublin to Sligo stretch is bad.  It is disappointing to see all the crosses at the roadside but they demonstrate that there is an urgent need.

I would not have anything to add to that.  That leads to Deputy Ellis's question on TEN-T funding and European funding.  The TEN-T regulation is a proposed one, which has not been passed, so whatever funding measures come with it will not be there yet.  When the regulation goes through, we will see what funding goes with it.  To some extent, I am sure it will draw on existing funds, such as the Cohesion Fund and the various other funds already in place, and perhaps direct them towards TEN-T projects.  To the extent that there is additional funding, we will flag it internally with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and will go from there in making applications for it.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLoughlin asked about the Colloney to Castlebaldwin road.  That is with the local authorities at the moment and we expect it to be in the hands of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by year end.  I mentioned earlier that An Bord Plean&aacute;la typically takes a year and a half to two years to deal with a scheme.  We expect, all going well, to have An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval for it in 2015.  The question of funding for it to go ahead arises at that stage.  <\/p><p>  The next work we will do on the N16 will almost certainly be phase two of the work which has been going on this year.  It ties in with it and it is a longer section.  It is ready to go.  That will be the next section.  It will not happen unless there is a change in arrangements.  It will not happen in 2014 because although it is one of a number of schemes which we have taken through design and planning and is ready to go, it is ready to go when we are in position to do it.<\/p><p>  We will talk to Sligo County Council about its realignment scheme.

It is important to point out that this occasion was not only about a meeting today.  We appreciate that our visitors attended and we acknowledge their input to the conversation.  It is also important that we express the viewpoint of the committee on Transport NI, which has nothing to do with the delegates.  That message can be conveyed.  I ask the members from the North to work with us and try to explore the possibility of having a meeting with their colleagues in the North.<\/p><p>  I will pick up on Senator White's point although I will not get into the areas where I disagree with her.  In regard to forward planning, there are great examples where the national roads design office, NRDO, is doing its work, especially in Donegal town.  I remember that in the early 1990s, the NRDO had a design ready for the Clar-Barnesmore project.  This point can be clarified but I understand that &euro;7 million was supposed to go towards a project in Dublin which was not ready.  The next thing we knew was that Clar-Barnesmore was ready to go because the design had been done.  The Deputy's message is the right one.  Obviously the delegates are working within funding constraints.  However, we could try to lay out a vision, have the design made and the preparatory work done.  For example, there is a design for the Letterkenny-Lifford-Strabane section.  Everything is a precursor to something else happening.  The Lifford-Strabane bridge is ready to go but the A5 project must be done first.  This is where the political fear creeps in.  If one big project is not ready to go, what happens to the rest of the funding?<\/p><p>  As a committee, we ask the delegates to stay in touch with us and help us to try to arrive at a degree of consistency in developing a vision.  A vision is quite simple.  We can look at all the inter-city connectivity from the capital to areas throughout the country and see all the good work the NRA has done, providing fantastic roads to Galway and Limerick, the south east and Cork.  Then we look at the missing pieces of the jigsaw.  This is not about entitlement.  There may have been a bit of parochial politics today but this is more than that.  It is about disenfranchisement, neglect, partition and all those elements of an entire geographical section of our country that was isolated as a result of lack of connectivity.  We want to work with the delegates.  If they can help us then we, as a committee, will help them to work towards their ambitions and aspirations.<\/p><p>  I ask the members to use their influence in their own positions, even if only to create public awareness of the work going on behind the scenes.  I am aware that officials are meeting at very high levels within Departments and local authorities, but the public must be made aware of this work.  Members of the public will say these roads are not going to go ahead simply because the funding is not available.  There is a negative attitude towards the ambition that we, as politicians, are trying to realise.  Whatever the visitors can do to help is welcome, even if it is only to raise more public awareness about how the committee could act as a facilitator.  We have met on this issue before.  It is important to keep them alive.  It is about fairness, justice and equality and about looking at the benefits of opening up an entire section of this country that was never opened up before.

I will pick out a few important highlights.  InterTradeIreland has been tasked by both Governments with boosting North-South economic co-operation for the mutual benefit of Northern Ireland and Ireland.  In the last 14 years, some 25,000 small and medium-sized enterprises have benefited from our cross-Border information and advice service.  Almost 5,000 companies have taken part in our all-island programmes.  These companies have generated &euro;725 million worth of trade and business development value.  More than 3,000 jobs have been created in these small and medium-sized enterprises.  The value of cross-Border trade is estimated to be approximately &euro;2.5 billion.<\/p><p>  Our vision<b><\/b>is to create an environment in which Ireland and Northern Ireland co-operate to ensure businesses are making full use of cross-Border opportunities to drive competitiveness, jobs and growth.  Our research has shown that 70% of all exporters took their first steps in exporting by trading with the other jurisdiction on the island, which indicates that there is a pathway to exporting.  Our supports focus on two key pillars, which are trade and innovation.  The demand for our programmes is very high.  We recently received 920 inquiries for the 60 places on our Fusion programme and 770 inquiries for the 60 places on our Acumen programme.  The 50 places on our pilot Elevate programme were easily filled.  It is clear that there is a demand for an Elevate programme that serves between 75 and 100 companies per annum.  It is clear that there is a substantial supply-side deficit for the programmes we deliver.<\/p><p>  Our performance is measured by reference to very stringent key performance indicators that are subject to tough assessment.  So far, we have exceeded the performance target that has been set for us in every corporate plan.  Between 2008 and 2010, the return on our expenditure was 10.6:1, which means that for every &euro;1 we spent, there was a return of &euro;10.60 in business value.  Our projected out-turn at the end of this year for the 2011-13 period is 15:1.  We had 200 first-time exporters and 92 first-time innovators in the first period.  We have had 195 such exporters and 235 such innovators in the second period.  Clearly, there has been a focus on innovation.  The jobs impact in the 2008-10 period was just over 500 jobs.  We estimate that the equivalent figure for the current period will be between 1,300 and 1,400.  In the 2011-13 corporate plan, we had to make cumulative efficiency savings of 3% per annum.  The number of companies we engage with has increased from approximately 8,800 in the first period to over 9,000 in the current period.  The business value generated - the extra sales and efficiencies achieved, or the extra investment made in the companies we are involved with - has increased from &euro;232 million to &euro;321 million.  At the same time, our budget has decreased from &euro;23.3 million to &euro;21.8 million.  It is clear that we are doing much more with much less.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons for our success has been the companies we seek to work with.  Our programmes focus on small firms that aspire to grow but have suffered from the decline in the domestic market.  As such companies are small, they have often gone off the radar of the larger development agencies.  We also focus on building companies that are sustainable by providing them with the capabilities and opportunities for sustained growth.  Companies that export or innovate are three times more likely to have grown over the past three years.  This fact, coupled with the convergence of business activity across the island at a level where only one in five businesses across the island are reporting increasing sales, points to an economic imperative to increase the number of businesses exporting and innovating.<\/p><p>  InterTradeIreland has shown that cross-Border co-operation has a clear and positive role to play in this sector.  In the last three years, we have assisted 235 companies to become first-time innovators and 195 more businesses to become first-time exporters.  As I have said, some 70% of off-island exporters took their first steps into the export market by starting with cross-Border sales on the island.  The benefits of close co-operation for mutual economic benefit have been shown in the research and development partnership between the United States and Ireland and the strength of North-South partnerships participating in the seventh EU framework programme.  There is a strong foundation in place for participants in the upcoming Horizon 2020 programme.  Our strategic priorities are to stimulate more job creation and job retention by increasing the numbers of businesses that benefit from our programmes, and to do this in the most efficient manner by ensuring the non-programme costs of the organisation are kept constant or reduced where possible.

When does he think the body will have reached its limit and fulfilled its mission?  People sometimes say to me that InterTradeIreland is just doing what other groups should be doing in the North or in the South.  In that context, can we get things working better?  I believe some of the criticisms of those who are asking questions about InterTradeIreland are unfair.  Some people say that the things it does would happen spontaneously anyway.

The question of when we will reach our limit, or when our mission will be accomplished, is a difficult one.  The sands are shifting as we move into the new territory on this island of the innovation model.  That is a shifting concept because new innovation is rolling out all the time.  One might think one has mastered something, but something new will come along.  We are going through a whole range of new technologies that are coming at us.  We are stuck now with new challenges that people would not have anticipated a decade or 20 years ago.  When the entire domestic market suffered as badly as it did, it put pressure on companies to find new markets.  Our role was to try to give them the capabilities to try to make sure they could do so.<\/p> <p>Everything we do is about providing capability.  We give sales capabilities and science, engineering or technology ability to companies.  We provide innovation capability within the company.  We provide assistance, but until the companies have those abilities and are able to export and innovate we will not reach an end.  However, there may come a point where the general dynamic of the economy comes into play and our system functions well and works strongly.<\/p><p> Mr. Gough may wish to speak about a recent cross-Border study in which the OECD looked at innovation on a cross-Border and regional basis and came up with some interesting findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400012#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382611200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Before I talk about that, I agree we have come a long way in the 14 or 15 years InterTradeIreland has been operating.  When we started off, we found the biggest barrier to fulfilling the remit we were given was that the business and university communities basically did not know each other.  The networks one would expect in an area with a Border the size of ours did not exist.  We have spent a lot of time developing those networks and as we have developed them, it has become clear that a host of new opportunities are coming about as a result.  We are facilitating those opportunities so that they deliver value for both economies.  For example, in the area of public procurement, last week over 1,000 business came together to look at opportunities to enter the all-island public procurement market.  We had buyers and SMEs from all over the island at this event.<\/p><p>  We have also seen clearly from other research that the Border is an opportunity in itself to help develop the export potential of the economy.  We know exports are driving growth and we also know, from our research, that 70% of exporters from this island took their first step into the export market by exporting into the other jurisdiction.  There is a clear pathway therefore for InterTradeIreland to help increase the export potential of the two economies by providing more SMEs with experience of exporting.<\/p><p>  The OECD report in which we have been involved looked at cross-Border co-operation in the area of innovation.  We are one of six regions examined.

They say that InterTradeIreland is 14 years in existence. The Acumen programme was running in Ballyconnell more than 14 years ago, so it probably predated the political progress made at the end of the 1990s and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  I am glad the witnesses have highlighted the significant potential and value of North-South business and co-operation.  This presentation dovetails with our earlier discussion on the need to improve infrastructure.  Most of us have had the opportunity to attend different events and to meet different companies.  I am aware of companies in my area of Cavan-Monaghan that have worked with InterTradeIreland through different programmes and that they value its contribution strongly.<\/p><p>  A number of North-South implementation bodies were established by the Good Friday Agreement.  We need to progress this in the all-island context for the good of the people of the 32 counties.  What potential is there or what is the next step required for InterTradeIreland, or a similar venture, to develop business and trade?  At this stage, some 15 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, we should be moving towards additional North-South bodies.<\/p><p>  We recognise the potential for further co-operation in the food sector.  Over the years in the agriculture sector, even before the valuable progress emanating from the Good Friday Agreement, there has been huge co-operation on the island of Ireland between the two Departments and the agencies.  This co-operation is ongoing in the farming, food and agri-sector.  Therefore, there may not be a need for a formal structure as the agencies North and South work well together.  We need greater emphasis on exports.  As mentioned, the pathway to exporting for many of our SMEs is to our neighbouring jurisdiction.  This message must be delivered and supported. <\/p><p>  Mention was made of programme 7 of the EU.  We are all aware that substantial funding over the past decade or 15 years has gone into research, innovation and development, but there is not a quick return on that investment.  A return on such investment takes time and some of the investment that took place eight or ten years ago is only paying dividends today in areas of business and economic activity.  I  am aware from our Departments and statutory agencies that they have been successful in sourcing funding from programme 7 and its predecessors.  However, some of the schemes and funding are only available when two jurisdictions or separate Administrations support the application.  In some cases three different member states must support applications.<\/p><p>  Is InterTradeIreland satisfied enough is being done to source additional funding from Europe for our island?  The President of the European Commission has often emphasised the need to fund adequately the research and development programme Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn has charge of.  This is an opportune time to emphasise the need to ensure the potential draw down for our country is maximised through co-operation North and South and between the different statutory agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400013#O00400","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382611200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank InterTradeIreland for its presentation and have three questions for the witnesses.

We have an excellent relationship with both sponsoring Departments.  Our relationship works smoothly and we have no difficulty in getting what we require.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the economic problems facing North and South have put significant pressure on everyone to make some contribution towards the effort required to get budgets back into balance.  There is continuing pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to get the cost of the public service down.  Every part of the public service has been affected by this in Northern Ireland, where there will be efficiency savings of 4% for the next three consecutive years and where there has been 3% savings for three consecutive years already.<\/p><p> Previously, I outlined how we have a significant demand for our programmes but reducing budgets.  We are devoting all the resources we can directly towards small and medium enterprises.  We are not too concerned about the administrative budget and we can take a reduction there easily enough, but when we have to cut back on the companies we have to manage demand carefully.  To that end, we are trying not to generate too much fervour for the programmes because, as I have shown previously, having 900 applications for 60 places is a recipe that could cause much disenchantment with the body and a perception that we are not fulfilling our requirements.  We must be careful to keep the pipeline controlled in order that we do not over-press for it.  The main difficulty we have is trying to meet as many of the requirements as we can with out over-egging the demand put towards us.<\/p><p> The sponsoring Departments have been very helpful to us.  We have good relations with them and we meet regularly.  There are no issues arising and we have never had a conflict about the things we wanted to do.  The Departments have been very supportive of the things we want to do.  However, we are all hampered by the overall efficiency drives that are needed.<\/p><p> A question was asked about outstanding barriers.  In our recent reports we have found that there are no regulatory barriers anymore.  The most important thing is to get the drive and ambition into the management teams of companies in order that they can export and grow and trying to engender that into companies is important.  That will be the real barrier because even though we say that up to 70% of companies export off the island of Ireland, over 60% have never exported - the figure may be even higher - or looked outside the domestic market.  We are actively encouraging companies to try to move up to that next step.<\/p><p> Deputy Smith asked about new powers and where we can go.  We are an implementation body and we can only follow whatever policy is put towards us.  We are policy takers rather than policy makers.  To that end, we will do everything that is assigned to us.  We have developed some new elements for dealing with micro-businesses in sales in cases where they are unable to meet the full requirements of our Acumen programme.  We have had a closer look at micro-companies that do not have the same resources as medium or larger companies and we have tailored a new sales programme for them.  There is certainly a benefit for them and they can take it up readily.<\/p><p> There was a question about getting innovation into companies.  We do not charge companies for the capability-building that we run.  We simply look for ambitious companies and try to get them to get at it.  These are two new areas we have gone into.  We are also looking at extending the public procurement process.  We have done a number of go-to-tender and meet-the-buyer sessions where we train people how to fill out procurement documents.  We have introduced small and medium enterprises to the buyers.  The next stage is to try to get SMEs to collaborate with each other to make joint bids.  Consortia building is becoming important.  The next big task is to try to get consortia building going among SMEs for public procurement.<\/p><p> We have enjoyed excellent success for companies under the European Commission seventh framework programme.  A minimum of three companies is required for applications.  We are in a good starting position because anyone leading with us is already in two jurisdictions.  We have had a high success rate, considerably higher than most other bodies throughout Europe, at approximately 30%.  We have also developed a user-friendly app, due out shortly, which will help companies with Horizon 2020 funding.  It helps to demystify some of the parts that were rather difficult for some companies.  We have an excellent working relationship with Invest NI and Enterprise Ireland in working to ensure that everything integrates well.  We have a good network in operation on the island and that will assist the process.<\/p><p> Deputy Ferris asked about the split and where our programmes fall.  One third of the entire operation and the companies we assist are in Northern Ireland and two thirds are in the South.  We tend to match it according to the funding we get, which is in the same proportions.<\/p><p> I did not pick up the question on the labour force properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013102400013#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382611800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I asked about excise, VAT, measures on taxation, compliance issues and environmental and labour laws.

Another lady and I started Lir Chocolates in 1987.  Mr. Hunter McGowan is correct.  Our first exporting steps were into the North.  It is a great experience to go into a different culture and jurisdiction.  It is a different world and there are different ways of doing business.  The professional culture in the North is different.  It was my job in the company to do the initial exporting steps and I fully appreciate what is involved.  I have it to say, in front of my political colleagues from the North, and I have absolutely no doubt from my experience, that business people in this part of the country, the Twenty-six Counties, were ahead of the politicians North and South on relationships.  The business people were ahead of the politicians.  It used to fascinate me that people were doing business under the radar while there was still a distance to go in resolving the crisis in the North.<\/p><p>  The point that annoys me most is that the British Government will not support or even come closer to the 12.5% corporation tax.  A short time back, Prime Minister David Cameron said that he will not have any further discussions or decision on it until after the Scottish referendum.  It is very disappointing.  It is a terrible waste.  Over the years, it has been the politicians in the North who have held back working with us.  I know that from my own information.  The politicians and the DUP in the North were very reluctant to work with the IDA here but there is now no doubt that things are changing.<\/p> <p> I thank InterTradeIreland for its participation in the steering group on the initiative for the centre for cross-Border studies, which is launching an exciting new project towards a Border development.  Getting employment going North and South is high on the agenda of this committee.  I started a business here when the unemployment rate stood at 17%.  Becoming unemployed is the most serious thing that could happen in a person's life.  Getting jobs for people is critical.  I compliment InterTradeIreland on its great work.  The witnesses are correct that 70% of exporters take their first steps by starting cross-Border sales. <\/p><p> Mr. McGowan said that InterTradeIreland is trying to encourage more companies here to export but if the person does not have the fire in their belly Mr. McGowan will not make them do it.  To become an entrepreneur and develop a business outside one's safe home zone one has to be a risk taker and have no fear.  One cannot drum that into people, if they do not have that fire for their businesses.  It has to come from within one's soul that one wants to bring this business to an export level.  Enterprise Ireland has come a long way in helping companies and giving them contacts around the world.  That was not available in my time.  I made the steps into the North.  I subsequently became very politically involved in the North.

A key criterion for us in working with companies is that the attributes and ambition of the key decision-maker within a small business are absolutely critical to how far that company wants to go.  We recognise through our work that there are many small and medium sized businesses across the island where the key decision-makers do have that ambition and we are giving them supports to take that ambition and the potential of their companies as far as it can go.  The first step is exporting across the island.  We fully agree with Senator White.<\/p><p>  There are still barriers to cross-Border trade.  There are regulatory differences but by and large, when businesses are aware of them, they can navigate the differences.  We see opportunities through much more enhanced co-operation.  That is what we are working on.  We are trying to create an open system of innovation across the island with the business at the centre.  A business in Ballymena may have an idea but it may need research expertise that resides in Cork, or venture capital investment, or some other technical or marketing expertise, to bring that idea to the market.  We are trying to put in place the schemes and the facilities to support that business, no matter where it resides on the island so that it can get access to whatever it needs to become more innovative or competitive.  We see that through the demand for our programmes.  We also see it through the FP7 that was mentioned.<\/p><p>  We set up an all-island steering group approximately two years ago that brings together the key agencies across the island to co-operate on enhancing North-South participation in FP7.  Approximately &euro;80 million has been drawn down for North-South participant programmes under FP7.  As a result of that co-operation that draw-down rate has increased substantially over the past two years.

One other issue that comes up often is access to finance and the availability of finance.  We will publish a report on that at the end of this month.  One of our findings is that SMEs over-rely on overdraft to fund their working capital, up to around 91%, compared with 61% for their European counterparts.  That is effectively caused by the lack of other opportunities to get venture capital or equity sharing.  We will raise that issue later.  We will publish the report in two or three weeks' time.  There has always been a great deal of attention given to that area.  The supply side is alright.  We have serious concerns that companies are not investing in growth finance to upgrade their equipment and their capabilities for future growth but are trying only to deal with the debts that they have on hand.  That will become a major issue as we go along.

Laboratories, TelLab, collaborating with Williams Industrial Services in Newtownabbey to develop a portable water pollution monitoring device.

It is critically important to do so.  I note that in amendment No. 20 the Minister proposes to delete the reference to consultation from this subsection.  We are dealing with section 9(3).  That amendment proposes to delete the last seven words, \"as part of any consultation processes undertaken\".  I had not envisaged that being removed and instead I argued that the agency should consult.  In this instance, it appears that all the agency is required to do is ensure consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation process undertaken, but, with the Minister's amendment, the provision will be that the agency ensure consideration is given to the views of children, which is very weak.  The measurement \"shall ensure that consideration is given\" leaves much to be desired.  There will be situations where less than what should have been employed will be accepted as an easy course and a quick means to a decision or an answer.  It is very important that the agency understand from the outset that it is required to consult and that not only consideration but due consideration be given to the views of children.  I feel strongly about this matter.  I hope that in the couple of days since we last addressed this amendment on Tuesday the Minister has given further favourable consideration to it.  I commend the amendment to her for the reasons I have explained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400003#B01100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382623200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>We have had a discussion on this amendment previously in which I made a number of points.  Clearly, this Bill is a major part of the reform of children's services we are undertaking.  For the first time, there will be very strong provisions in legislation relating to the abuse of children and the best interests of the child.  The fact that preventive family services will be included is spelled out clearly in the amendment I have tabled.  With regard to amendment No. 20, the opposite of what the Deputy said is the case.  In fact, a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, approached me about this issue.  They considered that that phrase should be removed because they believed it narrowed where the views of children would be heard.  However, we will discuss that amendment shortly.<\/p><p>  Obviously, consultation will be part and parcel of any new agency and its approach.  Any well functioning organisation will take decisions based on the evidence available to it.  Much of that evidence will emerge from client feedback and the increasingly key ways in which we take young people's views into account.  We will be informed by audits undertaken internally and externally.  To suggest that, by law, an organisation will be required to consult on all aspects of planning and reviewing the provision of services could have the unintended effect of paralysing management decision-making, diffusing responsibility for decisions and delaying a great deal of change where responsiveness is critical.  Of course, consultation is important, but it must be bedded in performance management at both organisational and individual senior management level.  I do not believe the amendments, by including the provision in this statutory way, would have the desired effect.  Therefore, I am not accepting them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400003#B01200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1382623200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Whatever about the arguments any voice might have put regarding the closing seven words of the subsection that the Minister proposes to delete, I come back to the obligation to consult in section 8(1)(<i>a<\/i>), (<i>b<\/i>) and (<i>c<\/i>), where relevant, and to ensure due consideration is given.  That is critically important when planning and reviewing the provision of services which is what the agency will do, certainly in its opening period.  Navel gazing is not acceptable.  It should, of course, consult.  If one wishes to review services, one must be involved in external engagement because nobody will do it better than those who are looking from an independent position.  Those in the middle of the forest will not see the trees.  Consultation is critical in arriving at the best results and the best possible approaches for planning and reviewing the provision of services.  Clearly, we are of two minds in this regard.  I believe the amendment would strengthen public confidence in the agency's role.  Certainly, if we were to change it to &quot;shall consult&quot;, it would give me confidence that the agency would be getting off to the right start, the start I expect of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400003#B01300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382623200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Not to rehash the argument, I support what Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has said.

The amendment seeks to substitute what appears in the legislation at section 9(4) with a new formulation of wording.  The critical focus of this is removing the reference to \"expressing\".  The wording as presented in the draft legislation states \"(4) The Agency shall, in performing its functions in respect of an individual child under the Child Care Act 1991 or the Adoption Act 2010, ensure that the views of that individual child, where that child is capable of forming and expressing his or her own views, be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.\"  It is also particular to the two Acts as mentioned in the text of section 9(4) as presented.<\/p><p>  My amendment seeks to remove the referencing or the caging of the requirement with regard to the two specific Acts, and the provision would apply in all aspects of the work of the agency under section.  Very importantly, it deals with cases where the child is capable of forming his or her own views.  It does not limit the provision's application to where the child is capable of forming and expressing his or her own views.  It may be argued that expression can apply or imply a variety of means of communication but I fear its most simple understanding is the one that could apply, namely, that the child should orally give voice.  Children will employ a range of means of communication and it is critical that those entrusted to establish their views, where they are capable of forming view, would look at the full ambit of how the child can communicate.  It is therefore important we delete the reference to \"expressing\" and accept that where the child is capable of forming his or her own views, those views be ascertained by whatever means or expertise and function that can be employed.  That should be given due weight with regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>  The subsection within section 9 is too limiting in that it refers to two named Acts and I am also fearful that the requirement of the wording with regard to \"expressing\" a view could work against what I would expect to be the Minister's own disposition and intent.  That is where the child is capable of forming views, they should be ascertained and given due weight, irrespective of whether the child is orally competent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400007#K00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382625300,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Is my amendment being taken with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400007#K00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382625300,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400007#K00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382625300,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Restricting section 9(4), relating to the voice of the child, to proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991 or the Adoption Act 2010 is a wasted opportunity to ensure that consultation with children could become standard practice for all professionals within the agency.<\/p> <p>As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, this is far too limited.

There is plenty of scope in the provision to cover the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in with regard to how the views will be ascertained by the individual worker or whoever has regard to the child or is making decision.  The legislation does not limit in any way how those views can be expressed or understood, but includes the provision as a strong principle.  It is not clear how the Deputy's amendment might be interpreted across the full range of the functions of the agency and it is not sufficiently clear in intent.

At individual level, it is considered good practice to obtain the views of children on service provision.  This is no more than any service user should expect.<\/p><p>  This amendment will give statutory expression to good practice.  This is particularly important in respect of children.  The amendment recognises the importance of hearing their views and giving effect to their voice in matters that relate specifically to them as service users in the agency.  The amendment will ensure that when the agency is exercising functions, for example functions under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and functions related to supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families under the Act, family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children, the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence and services related to the psychological welfare of children, it will be obliged, where the child is capable of forming and expressing his or her views, to ascertain the views of the child and give them due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>  This is an extension and strengthening of the legislation and means the provision will now apply to a broad range of services the agency is responsible for providing to children.  This includes the Education (Welfare) Act also.  People had concerns we were excluding that Act, but it is now included.

The dictionary definition in regard to \"expressing\" a view relates to communication.  Expressing an opinion is a physical performance, whether using a keyboard or any other means by which a child can offer a view.  There are different ways of expressing a view, but expressing is a physical act that requires certain attributes.  These will not always be evident to all concerned.  Different situations will apply, not only with regard to a child that has not been able to formulate a voice communication.  There will be other ways through which even children who have the capacity to speak may communicate their particular views, perhaps because of the difficulties that may present in a situation of great trauma.  There is a range of ways children's views can be noted, taken on board and shared.<\/p><p>  The purpose of going through the legislation is to ensure we do not limit its application nor draw boundaries to the practice of taking on board the views of the child.  I believe the use of the word \"expressing\" provides for this.  Committee Stage of a Bill is about teasing out the possible interpretations.  I believe the interpretation the proposed wording offers is the one the Minister, unthinkingly perhaps, used in reply to me.  The word she used was \"listen\" and that is as it is understood.  I believe that is too limiting and that if the child is capable of forming his or her views, those views must be ascertained, whatever the means or circumstances, and given due weight and taken into account.  That is my case and it stands on its merit.  I have no doubt there would be no shortage of experts who could confirm my concerns.  This should be taken into account and I ask the Minister to accede to the deletion of the particular reference in section 9(4).<\/p><p>  With regard to the extension in the Minister's amendment of the provision to other areas of legislation, it should not be limited to any of these, but should include all of them and more besides.

This provision is intended to focus on the special and unique relationships between the service delivery systems in the education and health areas with the effective functioning of the child and family agency.  Services under the remit of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills must work in tandem with the agency's functions and may, in fact, depend on one another.  Hence the focus on these two Departments.<\/p><p>  In the case of the Department of Education and Skills, for example, there are important synergies between schools at operational level and the NEWB.  In the case of the Department of Health, a very important shared service arrangement is intended to operate between the child and family agency and the HSE.  Ongoing consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will be a feature to ensure that this shared service arrangement works well.  There will be an ongoing important relationship between the agency and the Department of Health.  In addition, I already consult with my ministerial colleagues in the context of general Cabinet business.  Where the development of legislation may have an impact on a range of Departments, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs must ensure, in accordance with Cabinet procedures, that a memorandum for Government is prepared and that adequate time is allowed by the Departments potentially affected for consideration of the potential impact and the return of considered views.  This is then followed up at Cabinet level.<\/p><p>  It is also standard practice in my Department for the Minister and departmental officials to consult with a range of ministerial colleagues and Departments to ensure an exchange of views and a sharing of experience and knowledge.

The subsequent subsections would all have to be renumbered.  It would read: &#8220;The Board shall always include three individuals with experience or knowledge of the legal environment as it pertains to children and families; the disciplines of child protection, psychology, family support and therapeutic services.&#8221;<\/p><p>  It is important that the make-up of the board does indeed reflect these areas of expertise.  The requirement is that the individuals have experience or knowledge of the legal environment as it pertains.  That does not mean that they must be legally qualified or have been legal practitioners but that they have experience of the legal environment or a knowledge of the legislation as it pertains to children and families.  We specify the disciplines of child protection, psychology, family support and therapeutic services.<\/p><p>  In this particular instance I wish to place my view again on the record.  My understanding is that the Minister may indeed have sought to ensure that there is knowledge or expertise among the cohort of people who have given years of service through the family resource centre network.  I do not know whether the Minister has progressed the appointment of the entire board at this point but I acknowledge that she has made efforts in that regard.  They might not all have been successful but I wonder whether she continues to pursue someone with experience or knowledge in the area of family support.  I am specifically concerned with the family resource centre network where there is huge experience and knowledge and wherein there remains significant concern regarding the dropping of the reference to support in the title of the new agency.  It is just a fact of life; the dropping of the word &#8220;support&#8221; from the originally intended name of the new agency, which was the child and family support agency.  I still hear concern expressed time and again at the loss of the reference to &#8220;support&#8221; in the title of the new agency.  I have endeavoured as best I can, through my understanding and the Minister's assurance, to ensure that we are not losing that intent.<\/p><p>  I again commend to the Minister the employment of all effort to secure someone to serve on the board with the necessary knowledge and experience.  I know she is not seeking to have people who are representative only of particular areas of interest but there is an experience and knowledge in the area of family support which incorporates so much else in terms of child protection, psychology and therapeutic services within the ambit of the entire network and it would be tragic if we were to lose that critical input.  I commend the amendment to the Minister.  I would appreciate if she would elaborate a little on the areas to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400010#N01900","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382626800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It is self explanatory that the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we have a board composed of professional, competent personnel who have experience of the legal environment pertaining to children and families, the disciplines of child protection, psychology, family support and therapeutic services.

We do not wish to have a situation, which was previous practice, including by Ministers who were members of my party, that boards were filled as a reward to political cronies.  We wish to be sure that the best people are chosen to be on the board.

I have looked for expertise that is appropriate to the running of an agency that has 4,000 staff who have transferred from other sections of the public service.  This is a significant transition and a significant piece of public sector reform.  I have certainly approached the appointment of the board in a manner that will lead to the very best expertise being available to the CEO and the staff of that organisation.<\/p><p>  I refer to what the legislation says about the board.  It states that the board shall be appointed from among persons who, in the Minister's opinion, have experience of and expertise in matters connected to the functions of the agency - in other words, the services that the agency is supplying.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in makes the point about family support.  I reiterate that I have put into the functions of the agency now, with one of the amendments I brought here last week, preventative family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children.  That is a strong statement about the agency - that it has a function in preventative family support services.  That is now spelt out clearly in the legislation.  I appreciate there was some anxiety because the Family Support Agency is now part of a bigger agency.  I note the significant volume of work done by the Family Support Agency and the support it has given to family resource centres, whose work I hugely appreciate.  The family resource centres are doing an extremely strong job around the country in different communities where there are significant needs at present.  That is now copper-fastened in the functions of the agency.  It is really important that it is there.<\/p><p>  Going back to the board, I believe that those whom I have appointed and who should be appointed to this board are those who have the relevant experience in the range of areas the Deputy outlined.  Effectively, we want board members who have experience of family support services, who understand large organisations and who can deal with the governance issues that will arise.  For that reason, I have made the decisions on the basis of persons who have those skills.  Anybody looking at the members of the board will appreciate their range of family support experience.  I am reluctant to name individuals whom I have appointed in terms of the particular experience they bring.  However, for example, the chairperson, Ms Norah Gibbons, has a significant record of experience in the areas mentioned - child protection, family support, therapeutic family support services.  She certainly brings all of those skills.  Quite a number of the other appointments I have made to the board are persons who have the experience that Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Troy state ought to be on the board.<\/p><p>  I am of the view that the amendment is too prescriptive and could create inflexibility.  The function of the board is to oversee the activities of the agency.  As such, the suggestion that the composition of the board should reflect each function of the agency is unnecessary and restrictive.  One wants the correct balance of persons to be involved in the board at any given time and to run and work with the agency in an effective way.  It is not necessary to be as prescriptive as the Deputies are being in their amendment.<\/p><p>  At this stage, I have appointed eight of the nine members of the Family Support Agency board who will oversee the transition to the child and family agency and become the new agency's board upon establishment.  I repeat that I am pleased with the calibre of the board membership.  It brings together highly qualified and experienced members with a range of high-level skills, not only in the areas of child protection, family support and education and welfare but also in critical areas such as public sector reform, corporate governance, financial management, communications and change management, all of which are important when one is creating a new agency with this considerable staff of 4,000 which is separate from the HSE.<\/p><p>  I will not be accepting this amendment.  My bona fides in this matter have been well demonstrated.  I conclude by saying that the Bill does not prevent the Minister from appointing board members from particular professional backgrounds if that is desired.  Obviously, as I have said, some of the members of the board bring some of those professional backgrounds to their membership of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400011#O00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1382627400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>First, to the Minister's credit, nobody questioned her bone fides in this regard, but let me also remind her that we are all only here for the time being - FTB.

At this critical time, there is a need to ensure that there is knowledge and expertise represented on the board from the traditional family support background.

Clearly, if there were other areas it was precluded from at present, the mechanism would be to change the Health Act 2007 in which its functions are outlined.  We can certainly do that.

When subsection (2) is deleted there will be only two subsections in section 72 and it is therefore no longer correct to refer to subsection (3) and subsection (1).  Amendment No. 62 gives effect to the change necessary to subsection (1).  This is a technical description of the changes and the impact of the change on other sections of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The functions contained in the Family Support Agency Act 2001 are particularly prescriptive as to the precise schemes and programmes to be put in place to deliver family support.  It is considered that these are too rigid.  An element of the reform is to allow for the consolidation and integration of FSA functions within existing HSE family support functions within the new agency.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to amend the Bill to ensure that the flexibility required for the consolidation of all grant giving arrangements under Part 8 of the Bill is achieved.  The insertion of the new subsection (3) in section 8 will give acknowledgement to family support.  I have spoken a number of times of how important it is that we have an acknowledgement and statement in the Bill of the importance of family support.  One of the functions of the agency will be to work on preventative family supports.  Preventative strategies to help families are part and parcel of the work of the agency in the context of child welfare and protection.<\/p><p>  The policy intent in the framing of the new agency has been to broaden the scope of the agency beyond the traditional concept of child welfare and protection to emphasise family support as an essential area of activity.  The intention, in effect, in section 8(1)(<i>c<\/i>) is for a broad enabling provision to encompass all existing HSE and FSA functions which are transferring into the agency in addition to child welfare and protection.  While these functions are encompassed in the general enabling provision contained in section 8(1)(<i>c<\/i>), it is acknowledged that the absence of an explicit reference to family support might have caused undue concern, which is why it is being changed.  For that reason, it is proposed, together with the deletion of section 72(<i>c<\/i>), to introduce an amendment to section 8 to substitute a new subsection (3).  The amendment will provide for the more explicit expression of family support services, the blend of Family Support Agency Act and Child Care Act functions and give acknowledgement to family support as a preventative strategy in the context of child welfare and protection.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 64 is consequential on the amendment being made to section 72.  The effect of the amendment is to provide for anything commenced but not completed by either the Family Support Agency or the National Educational Welfare Board before establishment day so they can continue after establishment day.  Section 81 is a transitional provision.  It will only apply to anything commenced and not completed.  The amendment being made to delete the reference to &quot;insofar as it relates to a function transferred to the agency under section 72&quot; is a consequential amendment related to the deletion of section 72(2), which transfers the functions of the Family Support Agency to the child and family agency.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 77 is necessary to delete the reference in the Long Title to the transfer of functions from the Family Support Agency to the child and family agency.

When one disagregates from a very large body such as the HSE clearly a great amount of work is involved.  It has gone extremely well and there has been considerable co-operation from staff, on both the administrative side and by social or other care workers.  In addition, the HSE has managed to be very supportive.  For example, one of the key jobs we must do is to set up new financial arrangements and in this respect the organisation has been extremely supportive.  That is all progressing very well to enable a separate payroll to be established on the establishment of the agency, which is essential.  A payroll is in place for foster care, for example.  There are probably about 27 different mechanisms for paying foster parents and all of them have to be brought together.

a number of key changes to that Act as part of the wider quality agenda in early years services.  I would like to set out the context for committee members regarding some of the key issues affecting the child care sector.  As the changes are interconnected, I feel this is the most helpful approach.<\/p><p>  It is widely recognised that high-quality early education prior to entry into formal schooling leads to lasting social benefits that persist throughout life, both for the individual and for society.  Therefore, improving the quality of child care services is something to which all of us should be committed, whether members of Government, Members of the Oireachtas, child care organisations, service providers, child care professionals or parents.  I am particularly aware that, with regard to child care policy in this country, there has for a long time been a focus on bricks and mortar and the building of facilities to provide child care services.  What was lacking was a focus on the impact of such services and the people using them, the children.  However, some superb services have been developed and huge commitment has been shown by front-line staff in the early years sector, where a range of excellent services have been delivered over the years.<\/p><p>  I have constantly highlighted the importance of investing in and supporting high-quality interventions in the early years of children's lives and the work programme of my Department reflects this.  During the summer, when the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme was aired, there was, understandably, an outcry at the way in which children in certain child care centres were treated.  Members will recall that in the immediate aftermath of that programme, I addressed the D&aacute;il on several occasions, as well as this committee, to outline my response to the issues that arose.  I committed to the development and progression of a preschool quality agenda in conjunction with the HSE and other  key stakeholders.  This quality agenda can be summarised by the following points: increasing the qualifications required for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard of FETAC level 5; improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta framework and Aistear; implementing the new national preschool standards; introducing a registration system for all preschool services; taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and robust; publishing inspection reports online; ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and increasing and widening the sanctions that can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p>  What we have here before the committee today is another significant step in furthering the provision of quality services within the early years sector.  These amendments will provide for increasing qualifications in the early years sector as a whole, the introduction of a registration system for early years service and widening the response options that may be taken in regard to non-compliance with the regulations.  The key changes to the Child Care Act 1991 are that a new Part will replace the existing Part 7 and that 12 new sections relating to registration will be inserted.  These new sections are modelled on existing provisions contained in Part 8 of the 1991 Act.  <\/p><p>  I would like to draw the attention of the committee to some key sections of this Bill.  Section 58(2)(<i>c<\/i>) gives the Minister the power to make regulations on qualifications for child care staff.  Section 58C establishes the register, section 58D gives details of registration and section 58K sets out offences under the Act.  The inclusion of these changes leads to a change in the Long Title of the Act, which is dealt with in amendment No. 78.  I believe it is useful to address the overall intention behind the amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 I am introducing here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400023#AA00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1382634300,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I do not wish to cut across Deputy Troy, who put forward two amendments to this section, but I understand they have been disallowed.  I share his view strongly with regard to one of these, 58L.  Deputy Troy referred in particular to 58B and 58C.  I believe 58C is problematic.  I know the situation that applies and the difficulties that will present in some settings.  However, it is unacceptable that lesser standards will be acceptable where there are only three children involved, in a private home care setting, as against where more than three are involved.  The standards should apply across the board and there should be no exceptions in that regard.<\/p><p>  I understand how this applies to the situation within a family where we are talking about a grandmother or parental sibling support for children, because these are family arrangements.  However, when we go outside that and a commercial proposition is organised, where a person is paid for the service, it is not right to exempt these from the terms of this amendment to the Child Care Act.

I might propose an amendment to the proposed new section 58D(4) of the 1991 Act, which provides that \"the period of a registration shall be 3 years from the date of registration\", because I feel that such a period of time could be too long.  In the case of the proposed new section 58D(8), which states that \"the Agency shall attach a condition to a registration\", I feel that the agency should be able to attach \"conditions\" rather than \"a condition\" to the registration.  I wonder why a timeframe of \"within the 12 months preceding the date on which registration or removal from the register would take effect\" is being stipulated in the proposed new section 58D(9)(c).  What happens if it is found that there was an incident prior to the 12-month period in question?  I will propose an amendment in that regard.  I feel that the proposed new section 58H, which states that \"the Agency shall cause to be visited from time to time each prescribed early years service in order to ensure that the person carrying on the service is complying with this Part\", is very loosely worded.  It could lead to services not being visited over a protracted period of time.  One would hope that would not happen, but I suggest that it could happen under this new section.  I think we should stipulate that visits should happen annually or biannually.  I intend to propose amendments in these areas on Report Stage.  We can discuss them further at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400024#BB01400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382634900,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 that have been proposed by the Minister.  They address many concerns in respect of inspections, etc.  I ask the Minister to provide some clarity regarding the area of childminding in the context of the recent publication of a report, Right From the Start, by the expert advisory group on the early years strategy.  Does the Minister envisage that the recommendation in the report that regulation and support should be introduced for all paid non-relative childminders will be implemented?  If so, how does she think that can be done?  I refer her to the model that is used in this area in Scotland, where the number of registered childminders is much larger than it is in Ireland.  There are just 257 notified childminders in Ireland, compared with 6,000 in Scotland, which has a similar population.  What lessons does the Minister think we can learn from how other countries have approached this issue?  A balancing act is required in this sensitive area.  Obviously, there is a clear difference between the Irish tradition of childminding in the home, which is based on familial relationships, and the commercial form of childminding.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could comment on and clarify this aspect of the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400024#BB01500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1382634900,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The proposals with regard to registration have provoked a great deal of comment on childminding.  I would like to comment on them as well.  I have advocated the introduction of a register of early years services as part of the package of reforms aimed at improving quality in the early years sector.  While the HSE has introduced registration on an administrative basis, this section of the Bill will provide a statutory underpinning, which is important.  It will be the first time there will have been a statutory underpinning for these services.  Up to now, they were merely required to notify the HSE of their intention to open.  One such notification had been received within the appropriate timeframe.  Such providers were free to operate without having been inspected prior to the commencement of service provision.  That will no longer apply.  This section, coupled with the proposed section 58D, provides for the introduction of an early years service register.  It will be maintained by the agency and available for public inspection free of charge.  At a minimum, the register will contain the names of people who provide prescribed early years services.  Such people are referred to throughout the new Part as \"registered providers\".  The register will also contain the addresses of the premises on which such early years services are provided, the number of children each service can accommodate, the date of registration and any other details which may be required by regulations made under section 58B.<\/p><p>  Childminding in Ireland has traditionally been viewed as a private arrangement made by parents and has not been subject to any strict regulation.  Other countries have started to examine this issue and have taken a variety of approaches to the regulation of childminders.  We have encouraged childminders to voluntarily notify their services to the local city or county child care committee.  While some of them have done so, the number is nothing like the overall number of childminders who are actually involved in childminding.  I suggest that more work can be done in that regard.  Childminders could benefit from the kind of support and information that is available.  I will continue to actively promote the notification of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality training programmes.  It is extremely important to do so.  Clearly, we do not prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the regulations.  It is important for us to disseminate the information that is available.  Parents generally know that childminders are outside the scope of the regulations.  Individual parents take a great deal of care and time when they are making decisions about who will look after their children.  They investigate references and talk to various childminders.  As I have said, this activity is outside the scope of the regulations at present.<\/p><p>  The future role and regulation of the childminding sector is one of the specific issues of policy I have identified for consideration in the preparation of our early years strategy for children from birth to the age of six.  I expect work on this to be completed.  As Deputies know, I received a report from the expert group that addressed this issue.  We will examine the recommendations it made in this area.  I expect work on the development of our early years strategy to be completed later this year.  I will review the future regulation of childminders in that context.  Many aspects of this complex issue need to be considered.  Unregulated childminding has been the care of choice for many parents in Ireland over many years.  Some parents would welcome more regulation.  We have to ask certain questions.  What is in the best interests of children?  How do we go forward in this area?  There are many aspects to this matter.  I am not in a position to introduce regulations in this sector because I do not believe enough work has been done to examine the precise implications of doing so, or how we might go about doing so.  It is something to be considered in the future.  In the changes I am proposing today, my focus is on ensuring the quality of preschool settings in the first instance.  As I have mentioned, subject to a reasonable lead-in time and discussions with key stakeholders, I intend to extend the regulatory regime to school-age child care services as well as preschool child care services.  Pending the conclusion of that additional regulatory provision, I would like to turn my attention to the wider issue of childminding and what might be desirable in that section of early years service provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400024#BB01600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1382634900,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Minister did not refer specifically to the exemptions that are provided for in this amendment.

We need to promote this and advocate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC00500","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Childminding is an area I intend to look at, but I do not propose to approach it in a piecemeal way.  There is significant work to be done in regard to the early years services.  I am beginning that work today, in the context of ensuring there is proper registration, inspection, national standards and that people who work in the sector are qualified.  This is the first time that this series of initiatives and requirements will be part of legislation.  There is huge work to be done to implement what we bring forward at this committee today.<\/p><p>  In regard to childminding, there is a question as to what model of inspection will be appropriate.  Many countries do not regulate this sector at all, but leave it up to parents.  Scotland is an exception in this regard.  In many countries, the cultural approach or standard is that parents make their own decisions in regard to childminders and the state does not intervene.  I am minded to examine this area, but we must decide on what the right model is.  What model of inspection should be applied?  Who would visit the childminder and how many times a year?  We must be clear what model of regulation, inspection and standards would apply.  We would want the best interests of the child at the centre of our model.<\/p><p>  I have no argument with what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in suggests regarding the standards that should apply.  That is what parents would want.  Certainly, standards will apply to any childminders who come forward for registration.  However, there are many issues to be examined but I am not ready to deal with them now because the work has not been done yet.  It was not done by previous Governments.  There is a huge amount of work to be done before we can bring forward a change to the current situation in regard to childminders.  I do not rule out the setting of standards by any means.  The issue was addressed by the expert group when examining the early years sector and it made some recommendations.  We will have an early years strategy and I will begin an examination of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 67 have been ruled out of order because of a potential charge on the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 67 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 67 put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 68 has already been discussed with amendment No. 66.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC01000","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 68:<blockquote><br \/>In page 54, before section 91, but in Part 12, to insert the following new section:91.-- Any person who is, immediately before enactment --<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) appointed an educational welfare officer or an authorised person or designated a liaison officer under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000;<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) a person authorised to carry out functions under section 12 of the Adoption Act 2010;<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) appointed a coordinator under the Children Act 2001;<br \/>(<i>d<\/i>) a designated officer under the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998;<br \/>(<i>e<\/i>) appointed an authorised person or an authorised officer under the Child Care Act 1991,<\/blockquote>continues to hold that appointment, designation or authorisation until it is revoked or amended by the Agency.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC01100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p><p>Section 91 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Sections 92 and 93 agreed to.\r\nNEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 69:<blockquote><br \/>In page 55, after line 20, to insert the following new section:94.--The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is amended by the insertion of the following after section 896B (inserted by the Finance Act 2010):<blockquote>&#8220;896C. -- (1) In this section --<br \/>'Acts' has the meaning assigned to it by section 1078(1);<br \/>'Agency' means the Child and Family Agency.<\/blockquote>(2) The Agency shall, at such intervals as are specified by the Revenue Commissioners, supply to the Revenue Commissioners such information held by the Agency for the purposes of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991 as may be required for the performance of the functions of the Revenue Commissioners under the Acts.&#8221;.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC01400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 70:<blockquote><br \/>In page 55, after line 20, to insert the following new section:95.--The enactments specified in <i>Schedule 2 <\/i>are amended as indicated in that Schedule.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC01600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382635500,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382635500,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 71, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has been ruled out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400025#CC01800","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1382636100,"counter":597,"content":"<p>It has, but I want to make a point in this regard because I hope to be able to reconstruct it on Report Stage.<\/p><p>  I made a big shot at this.

In any event, the bottom line, in simple and straightforward terms, is that we need to get something appropriate within this legislation and if the Minister is going to knock me back on the basis of a potential charge, then no Opposition Deputy can progress the proposition.<\/p><p>  The Minister gave a commitment to me in a previous debate that she would see to it that we would enshrine in future legislation the right of children in care to after-care.  We went through all of this in a previous debate on the legislation on the floor of the House and I had hoped and anticipated that the previous debate would have been reflected in this legislation.  Clearly, the proposal is only on the basis of need, it is not that it will necessarily have a universal take-up.  Some young people will not want it or require it.  However, in the preparation for attaining their 18th year, starting earlier than 17 years of age, if they are in care at that age, there should be an engagement with them to plan their future into young adulthood.  Just as parents do in real terms with their own children in home settings, it should be a part of the natural outworking of the process where the State is the guardian of the child placed in a care setting.  We must emulate the best practice of natural parents or guardians in helping young people to prepare for young adulthood and later life but we are not compelled to do it currently.  This needs to be enshrined in legislation and this is why I am making an earnest re-appeal to the Minister.  This was the core purpose of amendments Nos. 71 and 72 but I brought it down to a smaller case in amendment No. 72.  I appeal to the Minister to take this up because otherwise it will be yet another lost opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013102400026#DD00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382636100,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The amendment has been ruled out of order but I gave a commitment that I was going to deal with the issue of after-care and put it on a statutory basis that a young person in care could have an assessment of his or her need done.

I ask members to be concise in their contributions as this will assist in the running of the meetings.  This is the first meeting in a series which will investigate the arrangements for end-of-life care in Ireland and what measures can be taken to ensure that persons of all ages who are approaching the end of life are enabled to die well and with dignity.  End-of-life issues will affect every human being.  They encompass the areas of both physical and mental health.  Death is a fact of life.  Some 29,000 people died in Ireland last year and up 290,000 people were bereaved and are coming to terms with loss.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate that the committee turn its attention to the current system of care for those who are dying and how the health services are organised to deal with end-of-life care.  I thank the committee members for their involvement in the preparation for these hearings.  I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for her assistance and Senator John Crown for his expertise.  <\/p><p>  This country has a long tradition of dealing sympathetically and respectfully with the end of life and bereavement.  It is important that those approaching the end of life, as well as their families and friends, are treated with dignity and respect and given proper care and support.  A significant part of the health budget is also invested in caring for our dying patients.  We need to examine how a high-quality health service can be provided by making proper use of resources.  We will all have an end-of-life experience - hopefully, not for a long time to come, although this is not in our hands to decide.  It is good policy for the committee to review and plan for the future.  I hope this series of meetings will help in the examination of the key issues and lead to the development of a basis for a framework for future planning and further action.  Over the course of these hearings we will hear from experts who are delivering end-of-life care in all care settings, be that in hospices, in the community or in nursing homes.  We thank those who are attending the committee meetings voluntarily and willingly in order to give us their insights and expertise.  <\/p><p>  I ask all contributors to be conscious of time, as there are two sessions today.  We plan to hold six sessions over the next five meetings.  The committee will publish a report which it is hoped will lead to further action.<\/p><p>  I welcome Ms Sharon Foley, Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke, Professor Eamon O'Shea and Dr. Joan McCarthy.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.   <\/p><p>  I invite Ms Sharon Foley, chief executive officer of the Irish Hospice Foundation, to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400003#D00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382603400,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to commend the committee's Chairman and members on their decision to hold a series of hearings into end-of-life care.  They are doing the people of Ireland a great service and I welcome the initiative.  Reviewing the care of the most vulnerable members of our society is both worthwhile and essential.  Every year, 29,000 people die in Ireland, and it is estimated that 290,000 people are left bereaved.  It is obvious that death matters in Ireland.  While &euro;72 million is budgeted for specialist palliative care, international research suggests that up to &euro;1.3 billion of the national health budget is being expended on end-of-life care.  However, this spending is largely unplanned and uncoordinated.  No one wins, neither the patient nor the State.<\/p><p>  The elements of a good death are truly personal to each and every one of us.  There are many elements, personal, communal and societal, which contribute to whether a person has a good death.  We cannot promise to be able to influence each of these factors but we do believe that much more can be done by health and social services to ensure better end-of-life care, everywhere.  We believe it is possible to secure high-quality care for those facing death which will also ensure the best use of resources.  We believe it is the right of every person to die in comfort and dignity, but we believe this must be planned for.  The key recommendation of the Irish Hospice Foundation is that we need a national end-of-life and bereavement strategy to plan for the inevitable and to ensure there is no absence of care and no ignorance of need and that end-of-life care is as good as possible.<\/p><p>  A national strategy is needed to help us to plan, develop and co-ordinate end-of-life care in hospices, hospitals, homes and communities, as well as addressing the wider economic, legal and administrative issues.  This must be a strategy for the entire population, from those who need GP support up to all those who need specialist palliative care to manage their pain and other complex symptoms.  This strategy needs to be relevant and supportive of all health care and social care staff who are required to deliver health and social care.  The strategy must be relevant to all patients, young and old, to patients all over Ireland and to patients with all conditions, including dementia.<\/p><p>  I have three further specific recommendations.  We need to develop hospice care.  We have plenty of strong national policies around specialist palliative care but we fall down when it comes to putting policy into practice.  The result is that some citizens have more access to more services and a choice of care while as many as 2,500 people cannot access an inpatient hospice bed because these do not exist in the regions in which they live.  The current number of hospice beds is 155.  According to HSE plans this number should be 450.  The budget for the national specialist service in 2013 was &euro;72 million - about one third of the cost of running one Dublin hospital for a year.  This budget has been cut repeatedly over the past few years.  Three regions in the country have no inpatient hospice unit - the north east, the midlands and the south east - as well as the counties of Kerry, Wicklow, Mayo and Roscommon.  This inequality between regions and counties is unacceptable.  Some people are able to access a full range of services while others with the same needs are denied this access. <\/p><p>  The lack of a full range of hospice services has an impact for patients and the health system.  Hospital care is expensive.  Our research into deaths from cancer shows that fewer sufferers die in hospital if they live in a region which has a hospice, from 52% of deaths in hospital in the north east to 21% in the mid-west.  The support of a hospice home care team will mean that a patient is nearly twice as likely to be able to die at home.<\/p> <p> Practical ways to support the provision of specialist palliative care are urgently needed.  A national end-of-life and bereavement strategy would help us to plan all services, including specialist hospice care.  In addition, there must be improved support for acute hospitals to deliver better end-of-life care.  Most of us wish to die at home, but 43% of us will die in an acute hospital.  A hospital audit we conducted shows that more than 80% of people who died in hospital were admitted via the emergency department, and had the same long wait as everybody else.  That is not what people want for themselves or their loved ones.  The audit also estimated that up to one quarter of patients could have died at home if the appropriate community supports had been in place.<\/p><p> A great deal remains to be done.  Our hospitals aim to cure, but they must acknowledge and plan for their role in providing end-of-life care.  The reality is that people die every day in hospitals.  That is not a failure on the part of those facilities; it is a fact of life.  We need to support hospitals in delivering the very best end-of-life care which ensures dignity and comfort for the dying patient.  There are already examples of excellent practice throughout the country, which should become everyday practice across the board.  For example, our hospice-friendly hospitals programme has developed a range of recognised quality standards, staff training programmes and practical resources.  If a charity can do that much, one can only imagine what might be done if services are properly planned and funded.  There is scope for substantial innovation and enhancement within the estimated &euro;1.3 billion that is allocated to end-of-life care.  I urge members to strive for more and work to do better.<\/p><p> Death in hospitals should be considered as part of the national strategy for end-of-life care.  While we await that strategy, we have a fantastic opportunity arising from the formation of the new hospital groupings.  These groupings should be directed to develop and deliver comprehensive plans for how they will cope with the people who die in their facilities and how they will care for the bereaved.  At the same time, we need to help more people to fulfil their wish to die at home.  Two thirds of those asked express a preference to die at home, but only 26% actually achieve that preference.  While people sometimes change their minds, it is clear that we can do more to help greater numbers to fulfil their wish to die at home.  A great deal of good work is already being done through our primary palliative care programme, our nursing for night care services and our funding of children's outreach nurses who support families caring for children at home.  However, active planning is needed to develop comprehensive home and community supports which, at the same time, will save resources in the acute hospital setting.  Again, we come back to how a national strategy can help us to develop community supports to help people to die at home.<\/p><p> If members take away only one point from today's meeting, I hope it is an awareness of the need for a national end-of-life and bereavement strategy which helps us to plan ahead and ensure people can die well, wherever they are.  It is worth remembering that we all have only one chance to get it right in terms of our end of life.

The forum represents the voice of people in Ireland on end-of-life issues surrounding dying, death and bereavement.  It is an initiative of the Irish Hospice Foundation and was launched in 2009 by the then President, Mary McAleese, and is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  I propose to highlight several areas in which the forum is working in order to enable people to die well in Ireland.<\/p><p>  One of the forum's key objectives, as contained in its work plan for 2013 to 2015, which was submitted to the committee, is to advocate for a national end-of-life strategy.  Issues arising at end of life are wider than simply health care.  Any of us who has had a loved one die knows only too well that there is a myriad of financial, legal, social, cultural and administrative issues related to a person's wishes other than those related directly to health care.  For this reason, we need a comprehensive interdepartmental strategy which can address all areas of end of life and ensure the issue is effectively addressed by Government policy.<\/p><p>  In short, we must recognise end of life as a natural part of the lifecyle.  Government policy addresses the needs of the newborn, of school-going children and of people up to and post retirement age.  So too should it address the needs of those at end of life.  The forum's work plan addressed some of the issues that should be addressed by an end-of-life strategy, including, for instance, regulation of the funeral industry &ndash; one of this country's least regulated industries &ndash; and the importance of end-of-life proofing of buildings to enable more people to die well in their own homes and communities.<\/p><p>  Another of the forum's objectives is to change policies and practices where this is required.  Our systems must be flexible enough to take on board the needs of those at end of life and to change accordingly.  Later today I will attend the forum's conference in Dublin Castle - an event that takes place every two years - where 300 members of the public and health professionals who are interested in doing things differently will discuss how we can make Ireland a good place to die.  One example of a procedure that needs to be adapted is the forum&rsquo;s recommendation that authority be extended to trained nurses and paramedics to pronounce death.  This was raised during the public consultation the forum undertook in 2009 to 2010 as something that needed to happen, both from the perspective of bereaved families and in terms of making effective use of personnel in hospitals and emergency situations.<\/p><p>  Advance care planning is another important issue.  How many members of this committee have made an up-to-date will that reflects their current circumstances and wishes?  If they are anything like the rest of the population, most of them will not have done so.  How many members have thought about where they would like to be cared for at the end of their lives?  Have they considered whether they would prefer to die at home and whether they would prefer cremation over burial, or <i>vice versa<\/i>?  Have they told anyone close to them about these wishes or kept them to themselves?  Many of us have made such decisions but without communicating them to another person.  Talking about death in Ireland is the final taboo we have to face.  People in many other countries make advance directives as a matter of course throughout their lifetime.  We need to catch up in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Think Ahead project - a major element of the forum's end-of-life work programme - is a public awareness initiative and broad advance planning tool designed to guide members of the public in discussing and recording their preference regarding end of life.  It is important that we articulate what we want in preparation for a day where we may not be able to speak for ourselves.  Not only is it our right to speak for ourselves; it is also our responsibility to spare our loved ones the burden of having to make decisions on our behalf, not knowing whether they are doing the right thing.  The forum is initiating a culture change through Think Ahead which encourages people to think, talk and tell: think about what they would like; talk to their doctor or someone they trust; and tell someone close to them of their wishes in order to ensure they are carried out.<\/p><p>  While advance directives are recognised in Irish law and are legally binding, there has as yet been no legislative framework to give clarity to the public and health care professionals.  That is set to change.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated in July 2013 that provision for advance directives will be included on Committee Stage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013.  We hope this will help to ensure that people know their rights and can express their preferences.<\/p><p>  Think Ahead was launched by An Taoiseach in 2011 and is currently being rolled out nationwide with the help of community groups and key players, including health professionals, solicitors, accountants and local politicians.  The initiative is part of the move in Ireland towards meeting our international obligations under the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults of 2000, the 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Council of Europe recommendation in 2009 regarding powers of attorney and advanced care directives.  These international obligations require us to have systems in place to take account of individuals' will and preferences and ensure their respect and dignity are maintained in carrying out their wishes at the end of life.<\/p><p>  We have an opportunity here to make real changes that will enable people to die well in Ireland.  We must take that opportunity.  I thank members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1382604000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Rickard-Clarke.

I possess a particular knowledge of end-of-life care, having doing some work in this area during the past five years or so.<\/p><p>  Irish people are living longer and this means that more of them are going to reach the stage at which end-of-life care will be necessary.  One of the important aspects of the work I do relates to transitioning to death.  Many people die outside the home, but transition to end of life is a really interesting concept in long-stay care in particular.  People transition into older age; they then transition into some level of dependency, then into perhaps residential care and then into the end-of-life stage.  It must be recognised that they undergo a series of transitions and that everything does not happen all at once.  We sometimes think of death as coming suddenly, but it often does not do so.  To reinforce what previous speakers stated, we must be aware of the need to integrate care structures in order to ensure that the various services work together.  I refer in particular to gerontology and palliative care services, which are critical.<\/p><p>  The other generic context is that of information flows between living and dying.  I spend a great deal of time in nursing homes and residential homes.  These are places of living but they are also places of dying.  What one notices immediately in these homes is the need to create a culture of understanding of death and of support for those who will be left behind.  Information flows between care staff and people who are dying and those who remain living are critical.  These are the critical interfaces we sometimes forget when considering palliative care services.<\/p><p>  The third generic concept relates to quality-of-life issues.  These are serious issues and one of the critical dimensions of the human rights of people who are dying is that they must continue to live until they actually pass away.  The sort of personhood associated with dying must be to the forefront in the context of how we care for those who are dying.  In this regard and in the context of the work I do in the area of dementia, it must be to the fore when it comes to those who are cognitively impaired.  There is a need to support those who cannot communicate in ways which would be considered normal but who can still communicate in some fashion.  These are critical aspects which we need to discuss.<\/p><p>  Another major issue relates to \"mediating differences\", as I term it, and communication.  Ms Rickard-Clarke referred to communication and advanced directives.  There is a need to take on board how we communicate decisions at various times in our lives.  For example, decisions we take now might resonate in ten, 20 or 30 years' time.  There is a need to be aware of this factor and the progress being made towards introducing legislation in this regard is really welcome.<\/p><p>  On the locus of decision-making among individuals, health professionals and families, we have all been at the interface at which we feel we want to give and receive information.  However, we do not always get the information we require.  Information is critical, as is the discourse relating to life and death.  It is difficult for people to discuss death, but this is so necessary if the quality of life and standard of care that are essential are to be achieved.<\/p><p>  Issues relating to communication and language barriers and to different cultural ways of dying are arising with increasing frequency.  Some of the staff at residential care homes come from different cultures and they may have a different interpretation and understanding of death and dying.  Increasing numbers of people from other cultures will be dying in our hospitals and residential care homes and we need to consider the differences to which I refer if we are to meet the requirements of such individuals.<\/p><p>  The final aspect of mediating differences relates to education and training.  It is critically important that generic staff should be trained to understand end-of-life care issues.  This matter cannot be viewed as being one with which palliative care services will deal.  All care staff in hospitals and residential care will be obliged to deal with death and dying and they need to be trained to do so.<\/p><p>  On facilities and services, we need to think more about the infrastructure of dying - that is, the places in which people die and the privacy, dignity and respect associated with death.  It is not always possible to do so but we need to make much better efforts to get the infrastructure right in terms of our approach to dying.  The position is similar with regard to the bereavement services required after death.  When someone in a residential care home dies, everyone notices.  We need to discuss this matter and put in place services for those who are left behind in such homes when a valued member of the community dies.  So often, this matter is just passed over.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a quick comment on dementia and the need to make cognitive impairment an issue.  There is some international evidence to the effect that people with dementia are often subject to unnecessary investigations, receive less pain relief and are the subject of over-prescribing.  There is a need to be careful when it comes to those with dementia who are nearing death.<\/p><p>  Following a number of years of research, I am of the view that there is a need for greater consultation with individuals for many years before death, as death approaches, when they are transitioning into long-stay care, and right up to the time of death.  We need to talk to people but we also need to learn how to talk to them.  Dialogue is extremely important.  The second element is that we must improve both the physical infrastructure and bereavement services.  The third element relates to enhanced education and training for staff, which is really critical.  The fourth element relates to the need to make end of life and bereavement major public policy issues.  I would encourage movement in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400005#F00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1382604600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Shea and welcome Dr. Joan McCarthy from the school of nursing and midwifery at UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400005#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382604600,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to attend these important hearings.

People are confused with regard to the processes relating to such care and uncertain about the role of families in the context of information-sharing with patients or in respect of making decisions for patients.  In addition, health professionals are uncertain with regard to patient autonomy rights and can feel pressurised by family members into denying patients relevant information or carrying out treatments they consider futile.<\/p><p>  An understanding of the ethical challenges at the end of life is central to good end-of-life care because lack of knowledge, uncertainty about ethical obligations and responsibilities, lack of confidence in expressing nagging doubts and concern with regard to litigation and professional accountability can and do lead to oversight, error and poor practice.  As previous speakers indicated, Irish legislative and regulatory bodies are driving reform in this area.  This is long overdue and welcome, but if the kinds of reform envisaged in the national consent policy or the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill are to be fully realised, then there must be a cultural shift in health care organisations and in practices.  Such a shift must also take place among members of the general public.  Ultimately, it makes good clinical, social and economic sense to develop educational strategies and support to ensure that clinical practice is ethically and legally sound.<\/p><p>  We might live in an age of instant solutions but ethical problems in end-of-life care are not easy to resolve because they involve value-laden opinions, strong personal beliefs and emotional responses.  As Professor O'Shea observed, the increasing diversity of the Irish population means that different cultural values must be respected and different religious perspectives understood.  There is also a need for greater sensitivity, deeper understanding and more inclusive policies and practices.  Increasingly, ethics is everybody's business.  We cannot just leave ethics to the ethical experts; nor can we assume that clinical expertise implies ethical expertise.  Moreover, recent legal challenges in respect of assisted suicide and euthanasia might have captured the public imagination but clarity and understanding are also required in order to engage with or understand more usual but also very complex and contested decisions and interventions such as those which relate to starting, stopping and de-escalating treatment, sedation, pain management and the provision of nutrition and hydration.<\/p> <p> It follows from that kind of complexity and the dense textured challenges that are presented in end-of-life decision making that educational strategies, policies and research need to be put in place.  One set of educational resources that has already contributed to demystifying ethical issues that arise in regard to end-of-life care is the document, Ethical Framework for End-of-Life Care.  It is the outcome of a unique collaboration between my team in University College Cork, UCC, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, and the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It is a set of resources for health and allied professionals and the general public.  It considers ethically challenging situations in end-of-life care in the context of ethical values, professional codes and laws.<\/p><p> In this presentation, I suggest two important simple, practical and economic initiatives that will consolidate and extend the work and the impact of the ethical framework.  The first initiative is a national network of clinical ethics committees.  Introducing clinical ethics committees into model one to four hospitals and other health care providers in the community would bring us in line with international practice.  In Canada, Australia and the United States they have such multidisciplinary committees, which perform a threefold function: To provide ethics education for health professionals, staff, patients and families; formulation and review of health care policies in the light of ethical considerations and; consultative support to staff with complex and difficult clinical cases.  Some committees already exist, for example, in Beaumont Hospital and the Bon Secours organisation in this country but I suggest that they are introduced across the board and that there is a regional and national network among the clinical ethics committees.  In light of budgetary constraints, the cost would be minimal and largely administrative at local level but there is a need for some support at national level to co-ordinate the network and ensure there is translation among various committees around best practice.<\/p><p> My second suggestion is a national end-of-life health care ethics observatory.  That would be a joint initiative of institutes and universities in partnership with hospital education centres and professional bodies in Ireland.  Building on the collaboration between UCC and RCSI the observatory would include tasks, such as providing educational support to the general public; to improve the training and continuous professional development of clinicians and health care staff; to develop and update the ethical framework to ensure that it is current and fit for purpose; and to initiate fourth level educational programmes, PhDs and clinical doctorates in clinical ethics and bioethics to support ongoing work.  Research would be included in that area.  Again, with an eye to budgetary constraints, the observatory could start as a virtual observatory.  What is important is that it is national not where it is sited.  It could be supported initially by a network of key people and eventually should find accommodation in the longer term in a large hospital.<br \/><b><\/b>Finally, when the Liverpool Care Pathway was found wanting in the UK, the reviewers called on the British Government to ensure that &quot;guidance on care for the dying is properly understood and acted upon, and tick-box exercises are confined to the waste paper basket for ever&quot;.<b><\/b>Drawing on the experience of others, we can see end of life and dying as a complex art.  Care of the dying is a complex art that demands a range of many skills, including ethical skills and competencies so that sight is not lost of the fundamental bond between professional and patient.  Where ethics support is part of a standard practice of health care organisations, the international evidence indicates that health care staff are more ethically literate leading to improved patient and family outcomes and less moral stress, desensitisation and burnout for health professionals who are struggling at the coalface due to current budgetary constraints.  The two initiatives I suggest, namely, the national clinical ethics committee network and the observatory would work together to ensure the development of that kind of ethical literacy.  It presents an opportunity for Ireland to take a leadership role internationally in the development of ethically and legally sound clinical practices in end-of-life care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382605200,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCarthy and all the witnesses for their excellent testimony this morning.

I wonder how much we should pin on the strategy as we wait for it.<\/p> <p>We have to get down to dealing immediately with some of the component parts of the issues the witnesses have raised with us.

To answer Senator MacSharry's question, the figure of &euro;1.3 billion is an international estimate based on an assumption that approximately 10% of the national health care budget is spent on end-of-life care.  That is being delivered not only by those providing specialist palliative care, which is for those with special and complex needs, but also by the public health nurse, the general practitioner or the general nurse working on the ward.  We do not know where all of that funding is spent but we get a sense that much more thought and planning could be put into end-of-life care in all health care settings to ensure we can deliver better end-of-life care.  That is from where we take our evidence.<\/p><p>  With regard to euthanasia, we in the Irish Hospice Foundation operate to hospice principles, which is neither to hasten nor to postpone death.  There is no doubt that there could be a debate on euthanasia but we would believe so much more needs to be done to deliver good palliative care services throughout the country.  That is our position.  We must get that right first before we move on to the next debate, and there is a good deal that needs to be done in that regard.  I held up a national strategy to members.  That was done in 2001.  In 2009 a national implementation plan was developed by the Health Service Executive which identified its priorities.  In a way that answers Senator van Turnhout's question as well.  There are many commitments in place but we must see those move into action.  Some updating and refreshing may need to be done in light of new findings, but we must move that into action. <\/p><p>  On the Government commitment, there was some commitment in the 2013 service plan to open the beds in Marymount that were developed as part of the new build in Marymount and also to move towards planning in Waterford and Kerry, but we still do not have an opening date for that.  These issues need to move from the pre-planning and discussion stage to actual plans and development.  It must be remembered also that each of those developments is hugely supported by volunteers who are out fundraising day after day to support them.  Their patience will run out at some point if they are not seeing commitments made.  Already, 44 beds that were built remain unopened, approximately 20 of them in the hospice in Blanchardstown.  It is simply not good enough to have these facilities developed, supported by the volunteers in line with national policy, and then not delivered upon.  Have I answered all my questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1382605800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382605800,"counter":670,"content":"<p>On the issue of euthanasia, Senator MacSharry might know that the Law Reform Commission produced a report in 2009 on the question of the recommendation of legislation for advanced care directives.  That was following an issue that had arisen in the public arena about the need to have this legislation.  The commission was not looking at that stage at the law on homicide, which includes assisted suicide and euthanasia as criminal offences.  It was saying that it had not even got off the blocks in terms of considering people's wishes at the end of life.  We need that conversation, and we need the legislation on advance care planning.  In the research the commission did it was very clear that if we had a good legal framework in terms of planning for the end of life, the debate would move away from assisted suicide and euthanasia to a later stage, but we have not even started that.<\/p><p>  I mentioned the various international obligations.  In 2009 the Council of Europe recommended that member states must have facilities in place to allow people the right to self-determination and autonomy, the right to enduring power of attorney and the right to have an advance care directive.  We badly need legislation to comply with our international obligations in that regard.<\/p><p>  On end-of-life-proofing of buildings, the forum is talking about cases in which people die at home.  It is about the adaptation of a room or, in terms of local authorities' development plans, the need to consider having wider doors in particular rooms in buildings or in communities.  Many people now are choosing not to be buried in the traditional manner and we must take account of people from other nationalities, etc., living in Ireland.  In the community and in the public arena we need buildings and facilities for people if they choose to be buried there.  There is also the question of crematoriums and so on, because more people are opting now to be cremated, but we do not have proper facilities in terms of public buildings, or even in our own homes, to deal with such issues.<\/p><p>  On the national strategy, I come at that issue from a non-health-care perspective.  In the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill we have the legislation on capacity but we have not yet got the detail of the Bill on advance care directives.  That proves that there is not always the interdepartmental coming together that is required.  From a legal perspective, we must have a strategy to allow people to assign enduring power of attorney so that when people lack capacity we are not into the courts system.  Similarly, in terms of their care, we have the advance care directive.  <\/p><p>  Regarding wills, we all know that not making wills causes great hardship to people and families.  When people are ill and dying I am averse to people running in asking them to sign pieces of paper or whatever.  If they have not made a will, that is not the time to do that.  There must be advance planning in all of those areas.  It is vital that all Departments with responsibilities in this area come together to develop an end-of-life strategy.  I hope I have answered the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1382605800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>How do we compare to Europe or the rest of the world in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382605800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Badly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1382605800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Is it a cultural thing or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382605800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>It is.  That is why we hear of the taboo with regard to talking about and planning for death.  In Canada, for example, when people get married, take out a mortgage and buy a house, they make their wills to provide for their children.  They assign enduring power of attorney and their advance care directives.  Those are in place and they continue to update them as their circumstances change; therefore, their wishes are being recorded all the time.  Culturally, we are bad at planning for that, but the international research indicates that when planning takes place it is easier for people facing the end of life, and indeed family members.<\/p><p>  Another issue is that people might say we do not have court cases on many of these issues.  We do not because people who lack capacity do not have money.  We do not have free legal aid for these issues, as we see in other jurisdictions where there is a lot of litigation.  We must get that planning in place and have a framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382605800,"counter":675,"content":"<p>To take up the question of euthanasia, I have no expertise in that area but I do have expertise in the issue of quality of life and communication about death.  That is the first step.  That needs to be done first.  The emphasis on quality of life and what is a good death requires conversation at a societal level as much as at a staffing level within the services.  That is the first stage in this discussion, as my colleagues have stated.<\/p><p>  With regard to education and training, there is a paradox, as far as I am concerned, in that dying is an inherently private experience but it is also an incredibly social experience.  It is a social experience for care staff and communities and we must think about that in terms of education and training.  I am not simply talking about education and training for better care but about attitudes to death.  It is about cultural appreciation of death and how to locate death within life - within the living - for the living.  That to me is as much part of a holistic approach to death as clinical guidelines or a good policy towards death and dying.<\/p><p>  One thing a strategy achieves - this goes back to the first question on expenditure - is to bring together a good deal of information and in that way provide a focus.  We know from experience that strategies tend to attract money and that they tend to make us make good decisions on the best approach to the spending of that money.  That is one of the good aspects of a strategy.<\/p> <p>We definitely must figure out how much we are spending because we need to know that to make good decisions about how to allocate resources.  However, there are issues with respect to other strategies.  For example, the national dementia strategy is about to be finalised over the next three to six months and within that there must be, for example, some appreciation of dying for people with dementia.  In other words, we also must integrate within such sectoral areas issues in respect of death and dying.  It is as important to bring such issues into these various places.  For example, this is also really important in respect of other chronic diseases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400007#H01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382606400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>On euthanasia, I agree with my colleagues about the importance of a national conversation on death and dying.  It is important to welcome and accept that sincere and reasonable people disagree about euthanasia and assisted suicide.  It would be good to welcome any kind of conversation about our fears and worries in this regard and not to be afraid of scaremongering to the effect that every discussion we have about death and dying must be or is about suicide, assisted suicide or euthanasia.  It would be good if people were not afraid to say what they believed about it, understood it to be and so on.  The kind of courageous journey of a citizen such as Marie Fleming is something that will happen repeatedly because people hold strongly to their wish to be in control of how they die and particularly of when they die when they face highly traumatic illnesses and so on.  On the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, I also believe it touches on people's underpinning moral values, their religious perspectives and their world views.  This of course makes it extremely difficult, profound and emotional.  We can honour this and can welcome differences of opinion about it without being obliged to say this commits us to this, that or the other thing.  In the meantime, as I stated in my presentation, ordinary and usual things happen in death and dying in respect of breaking bad news, sedation and so on, about which people do not have an understanding.  We are just beginning to grasp the importance of recognising and respecting patients' choices regarding ordinary, basic matters, the importance of communicating with patients and so on.  Consequently, there are many things we can do but in respect of assisted suicide and euthanasia, one certainly is to not be afraid of embracing the disagreement and the diversity of views pertaining to it - that is, the fact that reasonable and sincere people hold different views on it, the varying levels of evidence extant for the implications of introducing it and so on.  The discussion of the issue in the High Court was an example in which reasonable and sincere people discussed evidence in respect of assisted suicide.<\/p><p>  I was not sure about the question from Deputy McLellan about the clinical ethics committee being a stand-alone entity.  Perhaps I did not express myself clearly, but I am not talking about a stand-alone clinical ethics committee.  I am talking about a national network of clinical ethics committees, as well as some support for that national network in the form of a small task force in the HSE, the Department of Health or a large hospital, which would support the translation of ideas among the existing clinical ethics committees.  The eighth module of our ethical framework is quite detailed on this issue and was mainly written by Dr. Louise Campbell of NUI Galway, who is a national expert on clinical ethics committees.  In addition, Professor David Smith of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has been working closely with clinical ethics committees around the country.  Consequently, there is some national expertise in this area and the eighth module of the ethical framework explains what such committees are, how they work internationally and so on, which is helpful for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1382606400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>As five other speakers have indicated, I will now call on Senators Colm Burke and Crown and then Deputy Catherine Byrne, in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400008#J00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382606400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who made presentations this morning, as they were highly informative.  The Marymount hospice has opened in Cork this year and an additional 20 beds are being provided there.  I understand the facility is recruiting an additional 36 staff and hopefully they are about to come on-stream, which would be welcome.  I am a little concerned about the three areas in the country without hospice facilities or beds and they certainly should not be obliged to wait the 20 years it has taken for the expansion in Cork to take place.  This matter must be prioritised.  I have a concern regarding the national strategy that pertains to families.  On foot of the number of people who have left the country, many people no longer have children who live in Ireland and there must be careful planning for this issue in that present levels of support may well not be in place in ten or 15 years' time.  It is an issue that underpins the importance of putting in place a national strategy in this area.<\/p><p>  A number of speakers have touched on the legal issues and as someone who has been practising for more that 25 years, I am a little concerned about the lack of extant knowledge about the legal process.  Even simple matters arise, such as people who have made wills failing to advise the executors that they have been made.  This is amazing.  Similarly, trying to get people to create an enduring power of attorney is extremely difficult and I agree with Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke's point when she spoke about buying a house and getting all those things in place at the same time.  It is something that must be done and this is about disseminating information.  I seek the witnesses' views on how they would approach getting across such a message.  Should it be a joint approach from a number of Departments and Government agencies, or how do they envisage it happening?<\/p><p>  Another issue that concerns me greatly is the level of litigation now arising regarding the administration of estates for which wills are made.  I have found an increasing level of litigation where wills exist and one reason for this is the tendency of courts to allow costs for such litigation to be drawn from the estate of the deceased.  In cases in which people have a fairly frivolous claim against the estate, they will lose their action but their costs still are paid from out of the estate.  There is a message from this that must be dealt with because, speaking as someone who is operating in a legal capacity, I find amazing the reluctance of the courts to release moneys for the benefit of the person while at the same time, a great deal of those moneys are being used up in litigation afterwards.  Perhaps there should be a discussion paper on how restrictive are the courts with regard to releasing moneys where people require care.  This must be tackled and there is a present need to disseminate an information package in this regard.  As the relevant information is not out there, what are the witnesses' views as to how this should be approached?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400008#J00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1382606400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank our colleagues and, as someone who was recently told he was one of the leading referrers of people to the palliative services in the country, I just wish to state what an outstanding job they do.  It has been a real pleasure to see this specialty and discipline growing over the two decades in which I have been back in Ireland.  I have a couple of quick points to make and will ask a couple of quick questions.  First, I deal with a large number of patients who die and in each week of my career I meet on average two people who definitely will pass away from the illness with which they came to see me, as well as some others who ultimately also will have that outcome, where it might not have been apparent that it was inevitable but where it still has happened.  It has dawned on me that there is no real right way to die.  It is very different.  Some people clearly get phenomenal benefit from the warm embrace of being in a specialised purpose-built hospice, and that is really excellent.  Some people - I believe an increasing number - wish to die at home, and I believe we should do everything we can to accommodate them.  There also are people who wish to continue their care in a seamless fashion in the institution in which they have been looked after through the potentially curative phase of their illness.  However, when that is no longer working and when, sadly, they are in the terminal care phase of their illnesses, for want of a better phrase, they would be quite happy to stay in the same institution in which they had been treated.<\/p> <p>There is a real need to have a little flexibility and nimbleness in the way we develop our end-of-life services to accommodate those and facilitate the choice which is critical.<\/p><p> After the very sad conversation with a patient after the active phase of their treatment is over, they very often ask me if we are sending them to a hospice.  I tell them we would be delighted to have them go to the hospice if they so wish.  However, if they want me to continue being their doctor, we can give them the same care with the expert palliative services which we have in our hospital.  It is critically important in developing the strategy that we acknowledge those three elements.  Does the delegation believe there should be an emphasis on one direction rather than the other?<\/p><p> The second issue is one of cost.  There is no doubt there is a significant amount of waste in the care of people who would not be thought of as formally palliative.  Culturally and historically, palliative care has been regarded as cancer-related.  That is changing, however.  One reason is that the actual post-active treatment\/pre-death phase of many cancer patients is quite short.  Patients can be quite well, up and about and getting active treatment until that last treatment is no longer available to them.  Often that final phase is shorter than expected.  There is an increasing recognition that the extraordinary skills built up by palliative medicine doctors and care nurses would be beneficial for other people.  I was delighted to hear Professor O&rsquo;Shea refer to the needs of dementia patients.  There are many of them who have been badly disabled by cerebrovascular disease or strokes whose quality of life is miserable, who do not want any more active medical treatment and whose primary concern is the symptomatic quality of their life.  There is a real need to focus the energies and skills of the palliative services in directions which have not been thought of as classical palliative services.<\/p><p> With respect to cost, we often have a chat with a patient informing him or her that there is nothing else we can do to make the cancer shrink but we are not giving up and will look after them in a different way.  When one does cross that Rubicon, the aspect of the cost of the hospital-based part of the care becomes a lot cheaper.  This is apparent when one discourages the young doctors from enthusiastically ordering the extra tests they read about in medical school by asking them whether it will make the patient feel better or worse.  It is also important to cost the different methodologies in end-of-life care.<\/p><p> With respect to the euthanasia debate, I always promise my patients that I will be with them as long as they want and I will not let them die in pain.  If one takes that philosophy and undertakes to give whatever level of medication is required to make patients symptoms go away and guarantee patients will die comfortably, that is not euthanasia.<\/p><p> We must acknowledge that we have developed an extraordinary new national resource with one of the world&rsquo;s true leaders and developers in the field of palliative medicine, Professor Declan Walsh.  He has spent a long career in developing the palliative care unit at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States and has come to make his services available to us in Ireland.  He is a resource all of us need to tap into in a big way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400008#J00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382607000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of the National Council on the Forum of End of Life in Ireland lead by a woman I admire much, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, and wish it well in its conference today.  Most families want dignity and love for their loved ones when they are passing on.  There is a fear when the word \"hospice\" is mentioned.  However, they provide excellent care for the patient and their families.  I had the privilege of my mam dying at home with the help of a palliative care team, as well as the unconditional love of my two brothers who lived with her, minding her to the end.  For those who want to pass away at home, we should try our best to make it happen.  In the case of my mother, we were glad she could be at home surrounded by family and friends but most of all helped by the palliative care team which brought us into a space where we had never been before and made us very comfortable.<\/p><p>  I am surprised the report stated there are only 155 hospice beds available.  In 2013, the Health Service Executive, HSE, plan stated 92% of all patients referred to a hospice should be admitted in one week.  Given the shortage of hospice beds, how near are we to this target?<\/p><p>  I have been to several cremations lately.  It is like a conveyor belt with people put in one door and shoved out the other.  There is no time for people to stay around and sympathise with the family.  It seems to be a constant rush by undertakers to get people in and out on time so that someone else can pass through afterwards.  This is wrong and needs to be looked at.  What is the trend for cremations?  Are they becoming more of an option across the country?<\/p><p>  The Irish Association of Palliative Care terms palliative care as life-enabling.  In what way does one work towards changing the perception of palliative care?  When one hears someone is in palliative care, just like the word &ldquo;hospice&rdquo;, people automatically believe the person in such care will die.  This does not necessarily happen and people can live for some time with the right care.

Senator Burke asked about 92% of patients being referred in one week.  If there are no specialist hospice in-patient beds in a region patients cannot be referred.  The HSE simply cannot meet that target.<\/p><p>  Several people talked about legal issues and emigration.  I reiterate the point that end-of-life care and our approach to death, dying and bereavement is much wider than health.  That is why we are calling for a national end-of-life and bereavement strategy.<\/p><p>  To encourage people to deal with the legal matters involves raising the debate about dying, death and bereavement in Irish society.  Advance planning then becomes part of one's natural life.  One plans for the end of one's life when one is well and gets on with living one's life.  It should become an everyday practice. <\/p><p>  There are things that can be done now.  As we speak, the HSE and the Department of Health are drawing up their service plan for next year.  The committee can play an important role.  There is a need to protect the budget that is allocated to specialist palliative care, protecting hospice home care.<\/p> <p> Somebody asked a question about the impact of a hospice home care team on patients.  The team is able to come into the home and provide that care at home.  It makes a huge difference to patients at the end of life.  If a team has a patient with complex needs who requires a bit more care and they cannot provide that care at home, they have no choice but to transfer that patient to the hospice, if they are lucky enough to have one in the area, or the acute hospital.  They play a hugely important role but they need to be supported.  We have a concern about hospice home care.  Invariably, it is provided by small teams comprised of four to ten nurses, which are easily affected by cuts to budgets.  One must deal with sick leave, maternity leave or people leaving, or the team may suddenly be halved after a budget cut.  That has an impact on the ability to deliver hospice home care.  <\/p><p> I reiterate that one of the things that can be done is for projects that have been earmarked to go ahead is to move from a preplanning to a planning stage.  Senator Crown spoke about the choice of care location and promising people a good death.  In our larger submission, members will see that we outlined all the elements that contribute to a good death.  Some of those are well beyond our control.  A good death is in some ways a facet of whether one has had a good life, building up good family and social supports, whether one has a belief system, and how society supports people who are dying, so we cannot promise all of those things.  However, there are things we can do now to make things better.  What we would like to see in a broad end-of-life strategy is the taking into consideration and pulling together of all of these wider elements to produce a coherent road map for the next five to ten years.  <\/p><p> Senator Crown spoke about the need to improve skills in acute hospices.  We have been advocating for that for a long time.  In the past year, the clinical care programme for palliative care has developed a competency framework which has involved all the partners.  That is about increasing the skills of health care staff at all levels of the health care system so they have the requisite skills around palliative care and are able to deliver care.  We would like to see that competency framework developed.<\/p><p> My response to Senator Crown's and Deputy Neville's questions about what is being done to plug the gaps in the different areas is \"Not enough\".  In the midlands, we have funded a piece of work to look at what might be the care needs of patients in hospices.  It found the equivalent of 18 full-time beds are being used all the time for patients with palliative care needs.  In respect of the earlier point about much of the budget being spent on end-of-life care, it is there and is being spent on end-of-life care, but we do not know where it is being spent and it is largely unco-ordinated and unplanned.<\/p><p> My colleague will talk about the regulation of the funeral industry.  In terms of trends in cremation and the uses of cremation, we do not have the figures to date but all we know is that demand is rising, it is a very unregulated area and it is something that needs to be developed.  In respect of the communication strategy, requiring our staff to have good communication skills around end of life is one thing, and we must provide the training and education.  If any member wants to take part in any of our training and communication courses across all the Irish hospitals, we would be happy to provide the training or even come into Leinster House to provide that training.  Communication in respect of staff is also a facet of the general capacity of our society to talk about dying, death and bereavement.  There needs to be a better and more open debate in Irish society about the need to plan ahead and to consider and plan for people who are dying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400011#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382608200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>In respect of the point made about the level of support that will be available in the future for people whose family members are emigrating, this further emphasises the need for advanced care planning.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 will contain a provision for the office of public guardian.  One of the roles of the public guardian will be to devise codes of practice and a public awareness programme, including leaflets, to inform the public about the need to make wills, allocate enduring power of attorney and prepare advance care directives.  It will inform the members of the public about the need to plan ahead for when they lack capacity.  That is extremely important.  It is also extremely important in that the Bill provides that the public guardian will work with professional groups on codes of practice that will guide these groups.  For example, it is terribly important that lawyers have their own practice guidelines on how to deal with these issues.<\/p><p>  The tendency of the courts to allow costs to be awarded out of an estate is normal practice, but it is not always the case, depending on the situation.  Obviously, that is one of the current rules.  Many of the administration cases coming before the courts that are being litigated arise out of people dying in debt, so there are insolvent estates and difficulties arise in how to deal with that.  That is one aspect.  It is important to note that under the personal insolvency legislation, one of the mandatory requirements for a debtor is to make provision in the case of incapacity or death, so that they will probably draw up a will or allocate enduring power of attorney, which is a very worthwhile provision in that legislation.<\/p><p>  I could not emphasise the role of the public guardian strongly enough in respect of public awareness.  As I said in my opening statement, the forum is a public awareness initiative, so it is up to all of us in different groups and professions and the forum to promote public awareness of that planning, which is so important.  We talked about the training of health care professionals.  Many members of the public do not understand that they should go to a specialist lawyer in respect of these issues, which can be complicated and very difficult in particular family situations.  It is terribly important that lawyers' skills are improved, and the Law Society of Ireland has a role in that as well.  The Law Society of Ireland has issued a number of guidelines, particularly in respect of dealing with older people and vulnerable people, over the past few years, but there is still more to be done in that area.  <\/p><p>  In respect of the regulation of the funeral industry, there is no bar to entry and no licence provision at the moment.  There is no qualification for the embalming of bodies or opening of a crematorium.  We need regulation.  The council of the forum contains a representative of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors.  We have a working group that is looking at these issues and will make detailed proposals in respect of this.  We will be making proposals in respect of planning by local authorities for end-of-life situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400012#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1382608200,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Is Ms Rickard-Clarke saying that any person can open an undertaker business with no qualification and no standard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400012#O00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382608200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Yes.

One issue that came up was the uniqueness of death and how each death is different.  This is critical to maintaining the personhood about which we spoke, particularly with people who have cognitive impairment.  Again, I stress that particular groups need special attention in terms of the uniqueness of each death and the need for services to recognise that.  In respect of how communities are changing, particularly with regard to age and family structures, a good death requires communities of the living.  By that, I mean that we need living and vibrant communities in order for all of us to die well.  There must be some public visibility around death and that understanding of death to support the private grief that is associated with it.  This is something we need to think about in terms of how we organise health and social care services and how we integrate voluntary, statutory and family views about death.  It is critical to keep that community focus on the way we think about a holistic view of health rather than a clinical one all the time.  In respect of costs, we need serious scrutiny of how we spend money in the last weeks of life in terms of making good decisions about where best to allocate that money, because we do not know whether some of that expenditure might need to go to other areas that embrace some of these broader social, personhood and holistic elements of life.  To make good decisions about where we spend money, we need more information about how we allocate these resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400012#O00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1382608800,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Senator Crown made that point in his remarks.

It is interesting that older people, in particular, were willing to speak about death in general but when it came to being specific about their own deaths, there was reluctance on their part and among care staff in residential settings to address this issue.  We are learning how to speak openly about these issues but until we get to that point the information deficit will remain.  Where we have an information deficit or a vacuum, we can sometimes get bad policy.  This is not necessarily because what is going on is wrong but perhaps it is not what people prefer or need at that particular time.  That is related to resource allocation.  Sometimes we get bad resource allocation decisions because we are not concentrating on what is really important.  I do not have extensive expertise in this area but, from an economic point of view, it is important in the last months, weeks and hours of dying.  That is what we have to address in terms of the broader strategy if we are to understand these relationships.  It is particularly important to get resources to flow to where they can best be utilised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400013#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382608800,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Further to what my colleagues have said about the uniqueness of every death, it is important not to sanitise death or consider it in terms of dying in the surroundings of one's family.  There are patients who will rage against the dying of the light.  There are awkward patients and others with imperfect families or no families.  Health professionals have to deal with those kinds of situations.  Doctors and nurses must, for example, work with families and patients who are in conflict or despair.  Advance directives like think ahead and let me decide, which was developed by a colleague in UCC, Professor William Molloy, support health professionals and families because they make clear what the patients want.<\/p><p>  In regard to Deputy Catherine Byrne's question on perceptions of palliative care, the palliative care specialists coming before the committee in the next session will be able to speak to that subject more expertly than I can.  The European and Irish associations of palliative care have conducted research demonstrating that the use of palliative care does not hasten death.  If anything, it makes people more comfortable with the process of dying.  Pain management is something that accompanies the journey of the dying person.  It does not push him or her towards death.  It is a gift to all of us to be able to draw on that support.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Neville's question about euthanasia and assisted suicide, those debates are about the processes involved.  We are only beginning to understand what it means to respect people's autonomy.  What does it mean for us as a culture to accept people's choices, preferences and individual responses to their life projects and what obligations do these place on health professionals?  In very ordinary ways, people exercising choice is something that is difficult to promote.  For example, I was disoriented when I came to Leinster House today because I am not used to the system.  I was somewhat disempowered by the entire process.  In the same way, patients and their families are disempowered when they enter a hospital because they do not know what is going on.  In a basic way, we are only beginning to think about how we can enable people to believe they can participate and have a role in making decisions.  We need to develop processes that allow us to debate issues like euthanasia and assisted suicide in a reasonable way that allows sincere people to voice their views and consider national and international evidence.  We must also think about the impact such debates will have on the goals of medicine and nursing.  What are nurses and doctors supposed to be?  Important questions arise in regard to solidarity and communal responsibilities, as well as preserving the integrity of doctors and nurses.  As the Deputy noted, these issues are going to be a part of our culture but it is important that they do not sabotage the important subjects we need to discuss in the everyday sense of people dying in hospitals, health care settings or, ideally, at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400013#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1382608800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their empathetic presentations and, in particular, for their discussion of holistic death compared to clinical death.

The Voluntary Hospices Group is a membership group, representative of all the major voluntary specialist palliative care service providers in Ireland.  It provides 139 of the 153 hospice beds in the country, with another 46 beds ready to be opened.  In addition, all of the members operate specialist community services and day care services.<\/p><p>  The revenue budget of the group is &euro;53.5 million of which 69% is contributed by the State.  The capital spend by the group in the past five years was &euro;74 million, of which &euro;60 million, 81%, came from fund-raising.  The group&rsquo;s vision is that high-quality palliative care will be available to all who may need it, in all care settings, and in line with national policy and best practice.  The goal of palliative care is the achievement of the best possible quality of life for patients and their families. <\/p><p>  Current national policy on palliative care is based on the principles and recommendations of the 2001 report of the national advisory committee for palliative care.  The report describes specialist inpatient units - hospices - as the hub of all palliative care provision in a defined geographical area.  Where specialist palliative-care inpatient units exist, services are fully integrated, with easy movement between the acute and community services, enabling patients to be cared for in the location best suited to their needs at any particular time, be that their home, the community hospital or nursing home, the acute hospital or the local hospice.  Unfortunately there are several parts of the country without this key element of the system, while many of the services operate without the full complement of staff and professionals recommended in the report. <\/p><p>  The report recommended that there should be eight to ten specialist palliative-care beds per 100,000 of population.  This would suggest that there should therefore be between 367 and 458 beds in Ireland based on the 2011 census.  The reality is that there are only 153.  There are no hospice beds in the midlands or north east, with a token two beds in the south east.  It is imperative that the beds waiting to be opened in Cork and Blanchardstown are brought on stream as soon as possible, and that the eight new inpatient units and extensions to four others identified in the 2008 HSE development framework are progressed.<\/p><p>  There are major deficits in the staffing levels in the current specialist palliative-care services compared with the levels recommended in the 2001 report, across all disciplines and settings.  A 2006 baseline study conducted by the Irish Hospice Foundation confirmed that less than 50% of the posts recommended had been filled, and that an additional 744 staff would be needed to implement the recommendations.  As there have been many changes since the baseline study was carried out, in population, in practice, in skill mix, in models of care and in service developments, it would be extremely useful if a new study were initiated.  However, this should not be used as an excuse to delay efforts to reduce staffing deficits in existing services.  The scale of the challenge will require a phased response.<\/p><p>  More than 30% of funding of the Voluntary Hospices Group inpatient units comes from fund-raising and other non-statutory sources, while the 2008 HSE framework document suggests that the percentage for community-based palliative services may even be higher.  One of the recommendations of the 2001 report was that the State should fund all core specialist palliative-care services.  There was a further recommendation that there should be a protected specialist palliative-care budget.  This is essential to prevent erosion of the funding provided to date for specialist palliative-care services, and to protect future investment in the sector, particularly with the new structures planned for the health services.<\/p><p>  There is clear evidence that demonstrates significant savings when patients have access to comprehensive specialist palliative-care services, with greatly reduced admissions and length of stay in expensive, acute hospitals.  For example, the 2009 national cancer registry shows that just 19% of all cancer deaths in the mid-west, where there are well resourced and developed specialist palliative-care services, were in an acute hospital, compared with 50% in the north east, where there is no hospice.  <\/p><p>  Earlier studies by the Voluntary Hospices Group showed that the average bed cost in a hospice was over 20% lower than a bed in an acute hospital.  Other studies show that the availability of comprehensive palliative-care services minimises the number of patients needing access to either type of bed.  Investment in palliative care makes sense.<\/p><p>  The voluntary sector has been to the forefront in the provision of specialist palliative-care services in Ireland and is more than willing to contribute to the development of the services in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400015#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1382609700,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Dwyer.

I respectfully suggest that we should be asking a much more important question, that is, what needs to happen to ensure people live well until they die?  The Irish Palliative Medicine Consultants Association represents the 35 consultant physicians in palliative medicine in Ireland.  These consultants are members and the clinical leaders of the nation&rsquo;s specialist palliative-care services delivering care to patients and their families across all settings, including the home, acute hospitals and other settings throughout Ireland. <\/p><p>  Ireland has a long and proud tradition in pioneering the development and provision of palliative care.  Ireland was only the second country globally to recognise palliative medicine as a medical specialty.  In 2001 Ireland was the first country to produce a national plan for palliative-care service development and integration, which was subsequently adopted as Government policy.  There are many aspects of this plan which have not being implemented.  The national clinical programme for palliative care was established in 2010 and has developed many work streams to benefit the quality of care provided to patients in all care settings throughout the country.  The principals of palliative care are being taught across all disciplines, at both undergraduate and post-graduate level.  Frameworks are being developed by the palliative care clinical programme to ensure the essential elements of the palliative-care approach are embedded in health-care professional training. <\/p><p>  Our use of language and terminology in this area is extremely important.  End-of-life care refers to that care offered to an individual when death is imminent - when life expectancy is days or even hours.  End-of-life care is only a part of what palliative care is and by no means defines palliative care.  Palliative care aims to be life enabling and life enriching.  It strives to help patients to live until they die.  A patient never forgets how he or she is told of a serious diagnosis and the family never forgets how the patient dies.  The most important bereavement work is carried out before a patient dies. <\/p><p>  Palliative care has been a leader in the development of services that are truly integrated and stretch across boundaries of care settings to reach the patient in the right place at the right time.  This integrated approach enables our patients to transfer between care settings, depending on their individual clinical needs and personal preference, for example supporting a patient who wishes to be cared for at home and-or facilitating early discharge from an acute hospital to a hospice bed or community setting.  When adequately resourced, we are a service without barriers.<\/p><p>  Palliative care works closely alongside all specialties, looking after patients of all ages and in all settings.  Traditionally associated with cancer care, the principles of palliative care have been seen to benefit patients with diverse pathologies and now our expert skills are supporting other physicians in caring for patients with heart, kidney and lung disease, dementia, and other neurological conditions such as motor neuron disease.  There is a growing level of service provision to children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions.<\/p><p>  Health-care systems in Canada and Catalonia have demonstrated that palliative-care services are cost effective - even reducing overall cost of care - yet greatly enhance the quality of life for patients.  This is largely achieved by avoiding inappropriate hospital admissions which are often traumatic for the patient and family, and costly for the health service as a whole.  At the same time, early evidence in lung cancer patients is showing that patients receiving palliative care are living longer, despite - and perhaps because of - receiving less aggressive active treatments near the end of life.<\/p> <p>It is worth contemplating the impact on patients, perhaps in their last weeks of life, and their families of being admitted through a busy emergency department in the present day.  Is this always needed?  Surely there must be a way to prevent this happening so frequently.<\/p><p> Our population is ageing and by 2031, the population of those aged over 65 will have doubled.  This will increase the numbers of deaths per year and also significantly increase the number of people living with life-limiting illness, all of which will further increase the demand for palliative care.  Palliative-care services are readily placed to empower patients and their families by maximising the quality of life and offering choice of care setting.<\/p><p> What needs to happen to ensure people live well until they die?  The work of the palliative care clinical programme is focused on improving quality, equity of access based on the need of the individual and efficient use of resources.  This programme must continue to be resourced.  The emergent new governance structures of health care in Ireland must recognise the enhanced value of palliative care as an integrated service and the need to manage and finance it on this basis.  A dedicated budget for palliative care nationally and a single entity responsible for palliative-care services throughout the country would be significant steps to achieve this. <\/p><p> Services need to be adequately resourced as per the recommendations of national advisory committee on palliative care in 2001 to ensure that geographical inequities do not continue and effective care is available to those who need it.  As a core essential element of a comprehensive service, the ongoing gross deficits of specialist palliative-care inpatient hospice beds and required staffing in the midlands, the north east and the south east must be addressed urgently.  National service plans should address these and other such deficits to ensure equity of access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400015#R00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Creedon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382610300,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Creedon.

While I am a specialist working in palliative care, I am here on behalf of the board of the Irish Association for Palliative Care, a representative organisation of all health-care professionals involved in the delivery of palliative care across the country.  It is a collective and expert voice driving patient-centred, equitable and accessible palliative care for all who need it.<\/p><p>  As other speakers have also mentioned, palliative care is, first and foremost, about life.  It is an approach to care that is life-affirming and life-enabling.  I once looked after a gentleman who had developed a pressure sore on his right hip because he was in such dreadful pain from a pelvic tumour that the only position he could tolerate was sitting or lying on his right side.  He said it felt like someone was sticking a hot poker into him.  On admission to the hospice, he was in despair.  He said it felt like his life was over.  After two weeks of intensive pain management, of his physical, psychological, social and spiritual pain, with contributions from all the members of the interdisciplinary team, he was discharged home a changed man, with follow-up from the community specialist palliative-care team.  On discharge, he said that he now felt he could live again and enjoy the simple things in life.  He subsequently attended his daughter's wedding and died many months later in his own home.<\/p><p>  We are delighted the committee is asking the question what needs to happen to ensure that people die well in Ireland.  I echo what Dr. Creedon has said that we need to ask the question what needs to happen to ensure people live as well as possible right up until they die.  Access to palliative care is the answer and we propose to elaborate this under the headings of when, where, how and by whom.<\/p><p>  When is palliative care needed?  Although the gentleman I just described had cancer, the palliative-care approach is applicable across all illnesses that cannot be cured, all ages and in some cases from the time of first diagnosis.  Most deaths in Ireland, other than road traffic accidents, poisonings and suicide, can be anticipated in some way by the treating clinicians.  The international literature suggests that, if a clinician answers, \"No\" to the question, \"Would you be surprised if your patient died in the next six to 12 months?\", then a palliative care approach should be considered.  This could be the entry point to an informed discussion between the treating clinician, the patient and, if appropriate, the family.<\/p><p>  Where should palliative care be delivered?  Palliative care is an approach to caring for people with illnesses that will not be cured - it is not about a geographical place.  In specialist palliative care we aim to provide a service without walls, going to wherever the patient is, literally, as Dame Barbara Monroe, chief executive of St Christopher's Hospice, puts it, to deliver \"palliative care in the bed you're in\", whether that bed is in an acute hospital, community hospital, nursing home, hospice, or indeed the patient's own bed in his or her own home.  Unfortunately significant inequalities currently exist in specialist palliative-care service provision across the country, and the range of services that people with advanced disease can access is hugely variable according to where they live.<\/p><p>  How should palliative care delivered?  Specialist palliative care works best as an integrated programme, which means combining inpatient hospice beds with hospital-based inpatient and outpatient services, community services, bereavement care, and education and research services, with seamless pathways between one care setting and another, so that patients and their families can access the element of care that is most appropriate at any time.<\/p><p>  An example would be a specialist palliative-care programme providing in-reach to community hospitals and nursing homes, so as to avoid the necessity of sending elderly patients to the emergency department inappropriately and, if and when these patients are admitted to hospital, that their discharge back to a more appropriate setting is expedited.  Similarly, specialist palliative-care services work alongside paediatric and primary-care teams in enabling children with life-limiting illnesses to be cared for in their own homes.<\/p><p>  A core value of palliative care is the prevention and relief of suffering.  Support provided to family caregivers by the interdisciplinary team throughout the patient's journey and bereavement support after the patient's death help to prevent potential physical and mental ill health resulting from having lost a loved one.  It is important that after-death bereavement support for families is factored in when implementing a \"money follows the patient\" model of health care provision.<\/p><p>  Who should deliver palliative care?  The short answer is palliative care is everybody's responsibility.  For complex patients, specialist palliative care services will be directly involved in delivering care to a patient at any point and sometimes throughout the patient's illness journey, working alongside generalist services and all other specialties.  However, there are other patients whose needs are such that they do not necessarily require the specialist palliative-care team to provide care directly to them.  Rather the need is for the specialist palliative-care team to provide ongoing education and support to the primary care team or other specialist team looking after them.<\/p><p>  Very significant progress has been made in recent years with regard to palliative care in Ireland.  Even as recently as 30 years ago, the gentleman with the pelvic tumour I mentioned earlier would simply not have been able to access the service that, in his words, gave him his life back.  However, inequalities in service provision remain, and, as mentioned in the earlier session, the next ten years will see an exponential increase in the number of people with palliative-care needs, because of the increasing number of elderly people living longer with ill health and multiple illnesses, and at the other end of the age spectrum the increasing recognition of the number of children with palliative-care needs.  Therefore, we need to work together, using an integrated approach, so that we can provide both quality and quantity along with equity to future-proof palliative care, so that those with a life-limiting illness can live the lives they want to lead right up until they die.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400016#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr.  Margaret Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1382610300,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Clifford.

Thanks to modern medicine, people are living longer with serious and complex illness.  However, our health-care system is fragmented and difficult to navigate, just when the needs of chronically ill patients are growing at a rapid rate.  Also, service users are ageing and their needs are placing additional demands on health-care provision.<\/p><p>  The major challenges that face today&rsquo;s health-care system are clear.  The need for effective and inclusive solutions to these growing problems is urgent.  Palliative care can help in meeting these demands.  People with serious illness want the types of services that palliative care provides and they expect today's health-care system to deliver those services.<\/p> <p>Forward-looking jurisdictions understand that palliative care is a triple win - as beneficial to the patient as it is for the health care team as it is for the health care system.  They recognise that the provision of palliative care is the responsibility of the entire health care system and not just specialist palliative care services.  Both generalist and specialist services have a part to play in the effective treatment and care of people with life-limiting conditions.<\/p><p> When considering the question of what needs to happen to ensure that people die well in Ireland, it is important to remember that uncertainty is an integral part of dying.  Contrary to popular belief, the transition towards dying is often not a clear-cut or linear process, and protocols or pathways that utilise so-called prognostic triggers are often imprecise, lack clinical nuance and fail to reflect the complexity of decision-making in this area.  The term &quot;end of life&quot; is one that is ambiguous as it may be variously interpreted to cover the last year, the last month, the last weeks or the last hours or days of life.<\/p><p> End-of-life care is not the same as palliative care.  End-of-life care is an imprecise term but implies time-defined care.  It is a quantitative rather than qualitative descriptor that excludes the purpose of care.  In contrast, palliative care is not time-confined but it is goal-oriented.  The discipline of palliative care helps patients to live until they die, whenever that occurs.  Both comfort-promoting and appropriate disease-modifying interventions can coexist in the integrated model of palliative care provision.  This encourages a needs-based approach to palliative care provision rather than depending on a clinician&rsquo;s uncertain ability to make a diagnosis of dying.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise the significant work done to date in Ireland in developing palliative care and improving the care provided to people at the end of life and to use that as a firm foundation for moving forward.  We have a strong tradition in this area and there has been international acknowledgement of our achievements to date.  In 2010, <i>The Economist<\/i>Intelligence Unit ranked Ireland fourth out of 40 countries overall in its quality of death index.  This acknowledgement provides an indication of what can be achieved by a visionary and universally accepted palliative care strategy, leadership on a national and local level and community engagement.  We are indebted to all of those politicians, civil servants, managers, health and social care professionals, service users, advocacy organisations and members of the public who have made such efforts to promote, develop and provide palliative care services.  However, significant deficiencies in palliative care provision remain.<\/p><p> Health system strengthening can be defined as any array of initiatives and strategies that improves one or more of the functions of the health system and leads to better health through improvements in access, coverage, quality or efficiency.  The World Health Report 2000 identifies the four key functions of the health system as stewardship, financing, human and physical resources, and organisation and management of service delivery.  Levers for strengthening palliative care provision will be considered in each of these areas in turn.<\/p><p> The stewardship or governance function reflects the fact that people entrust both their lives and their resources to the health system.  A variety of possible levers may be exercised to improve palliative care service provision including maintaining alignment of palliative care across policy, commissioning and services.  This principle should be reflected in the assignment of the palliative care function to designated senior personnel in the relevant organisations; ensuring that a strong accountability mechanism that clarifies palliative care budget allocation, expenditure and funding requirements exists; providing support to raise awareness for specific palliative care messages and behaviours; and ensuring that palliative care is part of all health and social care policies for non-communicable diseases.<\/p><p> Health financing is a key determinant of health system performance in terms of equity, efficiency and quality.  The following levers may be applied to ensure adequate funding for modern, responsive palliative care services: reviewing the specialist palliative care budget to address deficiencies in service provision and ensuring that palliative care is made a funding priority; and ensuring that palliative care is commissioned and delivered as an integrated service regardless of setting and funding mechanism applied.<\/p><p> The third function of the health system is the management of its human and physical resources.  The following levers may be applied: developing a generalist workforce with appropriate palliative care skills; facilitating health care services to support working practices that allow staff to most effectively use their skills to provide quality palliative care including dedicating sufficient time to patients and their carers; ensuring affordable access to equipment and medications necessary to provide quality palliative care in the community; supporting the appropriate redesign of the infrastructure of health care facilities to ensure accessibility, comfort and dignity for service users; and investing in palliative care health information systems.<\/p><p> The final function of the health system is in the organisation and management of service delivery.  Health services are the most visible function of any health system.  A number of opportunities exist in this area to improve palliative care provision such as addressing the deficits in palliative care bed provision and shortages in specialist palliative care staffing; increasing access to in-home support, including access to 24-hour, seven-day on-call support and support for carers; increasing access to rehabilitation and respite care as required; increasing recognition of and service development for bereavement care for families and carers; realising continuity of care by integrating existing resources and systems to provide for co-ordinated case management systems and promoting linkages between specialist palliative care services and other parts of the health system; supporting palliative care practice through the promotion of the palliative care clinical programme - at this point I ought to declare my interest in so far as I am the clinical lead of the palliative care programme; and supporting research that examines the most appropriate ways to assess and monitor palliative care service provision.<\/p><p> Palliative care represents a paradigm shift in the management of life-limiting conditions, providing interdisciplinary co-ordination and team-driven continuity of care while efficiently utilising health care resources and delivery systems.  Addressing outstanding deficiencies in palliative care provision offers a key solution to current challenges facing the health care system and will help people to die well in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400016#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382610900,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Ms Paddie Blaney, director of the All-Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care.

I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the joint committee on behalf of the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care, AIIHPC.  The institute is a collaboration of partner organisations and a mixture of care providers and academic institutions from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, originally having 12 partner organisations but now numbering 14 and soon to be 17.  This is a collaborative spanning all major hospice and palliative care providers and all nine universities on the island of Ireland.  Palliative care experts from across the globe are collaborating with the institute.  It is from this rich and diverse collaborative base that the institute seeks to achieve its aim, that is, an improved experience of care.<\/p><p>  As requested by the committee, the scope of this submission is specifically focused on specialist palliative care.  We ask the committee to note that the remit of the institute also embraces general palliative care provision in the wider health and social care settings as well as work with users, carers and communities to help achieve greater awareness, understanding and engagement.<\/p><p>  The vision for the institute is that people across the island of Ireland living with a progressive or long-term illness experience the best care possible up to and including the very last days of their lives.  Our vision recognises that this is a journey that may span a number of years, not just months.  In this vision best care is synonymous with the goal of the best possible quality of life.  The institute is helping to make this happen by working closely with all those involved to increase research, enhance education, create resources and influence policy.<\/p><p>  Regarding increased research, initial funding has helped lay the foundations of a palliative care research network, the PCRN, on the island of Ireland.  Eight research projects are under way aimed at addressing social justice aspects, better measurement and evaluation and looking at how to transfer learning from research into practice.  Work identifying palliative care research priorities and exploring the application of technology sector solutions to meet palliative care needs is also under way.<\/p><p>  The institute partners constituting all key players on the island affords opportunities to collaborate for high-quality, focused and meaningful research.  The PCRN also affords excellent opportunities initially for European and international partnerships and ultimately becoming a global player in palliative care research and development.  In terms of what is needed, it includes infrastructure support to ensure the basic research network architecture is sustainable; support to pursue research programmes; support to secure funding from European Union programmes and initiatives and to secure international and global partnerships; and funding to support early career researchers.<\/p><p>  The right education is vital.  We have worked with the Health Service Executive to identify palliative care competencies to underpin all undergraduate and postgraduate professional education.  We have also worked with partner organisations to expand information on available education programmes both across the island of Ireland and internationally.  We are working with hospice education providers to ensure more education is made available on a modern electronic learning platform.  We have supported leadership development, all-island network developments and visits to exemplar sites across Europe and internationally, ensuring the learning is brought back to the Irish palliative care community.  <\/p><p>  In terms of what is needed, workforce planning must include funding for workforce development, that is, staff should be released to undertake development.  Palliative care educators must be supported in their efforts to assist in the education and development of the general palliative care provision.  There should be more support for the leadership development of palliative care practitioners at all levels and in all sectors.<\/p> <p>Regulatory bodies should seek to ensure that palliative care principles underpin all undergraduate and postgraduate education programmes.<\/p><p> The institute is also working to develop resources and we are leading an initiative aimed at providing a modern communications and learning hub aimed at three main audiences, including palliative care professionals, adults receiving palliative care and children and young people receiving palliative care.  All three audiences will be able to avail of education, skill building and awareness-raising programmes housed in a modern interactive learning platform.  Co-ordinating one point of access to a myriad of palliative care information and provision will have profound benefits for all these audiences and establish a valuable resource. So what must happen?<\/p><p> Commissioners and providers of palliative care services within both jurisdictions must engage with and help resource this initiative.  We would welcome government support for a wide marketing and awareness campaign in 2014, and opportunities should be taken at the national level to collaborate with the technology sector and ensure our populations might universally access this important resource.<\/p><p> The institute, representing the research, education, practice and policy interests of palliative care providers, is working to contribute to policy development and evaluation. The institute is inviting and facilitating discussions around key policy developments, trends and emerging issues on an all-island basis between the two jurisdictions, recognising that there is significant opportunity for synergy and possible joint policy drivers.  Support has been given by ministerial colleagues in both jurisdictions for the institute to provide a presentation at a forthcoming North-South Ministerial Council.  The institute should be included in policy and service developments so as to contribute, and where possible, align work activities with key national priorities.  The institute could contribute to the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s World Health Assembly delegation, where appropriate, to help influence relevant WHO resolutions.  It could be funded to undertake policy evaluation or strategy developments where required.<\/p><p> A palliative approach to care may be appropriate for many people across the age range, and for all of these people the goal of care is quality of life.  We recognise that not all people who require it receive this type of care and many do not receive it early enough.  In establishing the institute, palliative care leaders are hopeful that as our health care systems seek to provide the right palliative care resources in the right places and at the right time, the institute can support the quality and capacity of those specialist palliative care resources.  We thank the committee for its attention and relay our best wishes on what we hope will be a productive series of hearings.  We would be delighted to provide any further information that may help the committee in its deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400017#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paddie Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382611500,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Our final speaker is Professor Doiminic &Oacute; Brannag&aacute;in, a consultant in palliative medicine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400018#U00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382611500,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the opportunity to address them today.  My colleague, Dr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, in introducing the report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care in 2001, wrote &quot;As a society, perhaps the most sensitive measurement of our maturity is the manner in which we care for those who are facing the ultimate challenge - the loss of life&quot;.  It is timely, therefore, 12 years on from the adoption of this report as Government policy, that the Joint Committee on Health and Children should revisit this subject.  I sat in this room five years ago, the last time the joint committee considered the matter, and the deliberations were extremely helpful and productive in bringing about significant change.  I lend my support to the deliberations on this occasion on this vital topic.  I do not propose to read from my script because of time limitations but I will concentrate on three key messages.  These are the health benefits of palliative care; &quot;upstreaming&quot; of palliative care; and the importance of integration of palliative care.<\/p><p>  Dame Cicely Saunders, who is credited with the modern hospice movement, wrote:<blockquote>I once asked a man who knew he was dying what he needed above all in those who were caring for him.  He said, &quot;For someone to look as if they are trying to understand me&quot;.<\/blockquote>Palliative medicine, the science that informs specialist palliative care, attempts to do this.  In accompanying patients and their families to a place where few clinicians are comfortable, we have developed a body of medical science and expertise demonstrating unequivocal evidence in advanced cancer and emerging evidence in heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure and certain neurological conditions.  We can produce improved symptom management in patients, quality of life, decision making with regard to patients' choices of care, as well as decreased caregiver burden and increased length of life, as evidenced in recent studies on advanced cancer.  If this was a pharmacological or surgical intervention, we would have people clamouring on the streets to get it.  Nevertheless, the reality is that people do not truly understand the health benefits of palliative care.  In the north east we have undertaken a piece of research on patients who are actively receiving palliative care and their families.  Many of them did not understand the words and language we used, and it was only when bereaved family and caregivers had concluded the care that they truly understood the benefits that could be achieved for loved ones.<\/p><p>  Upstreaming is the incorporation of palliative care into standard care approaches to life-limiting illness.  We should draw on the expertise we have seen delivered very successfully in Ireland through the National Cancer Control Programme, with specialist palliative care now forming an integral part of the planning process of treatment for patients.  We should seek to incorporate that into other approaches for life-limiting illnesses.<\/p><p>  Drawing on my experience, in the north east we have two acute hospital-based teams and three community-based teams.  Our service is placed predominantly in the hospital in the first instance and we have shown that we can both detect patients with life-limiting illness earlier and offer them choice, as Senator Crown noted in his earlier comments.  By this we can influence the policy on palliative care within acute hospitals to the benefit of all patients. In the 12 years our service has existed in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, the number of referrals of patients with a non-cancer diagnosis has increased to 40%.  Most importantly, we can influence and have an input into the care management of patients on a seven-day basis, including out of hours.<\/p><p>  A third point refers to integration.  In most cases, when people speak about specialist palliative care and integration, they refer to the integration of the palliative care services, which are integrated seamlessly from one element to another, including hospice care, care in acute hospitals, care in the community and education and research services provided.  This enables navigation of the patient from one care setting to another, to the benefit of the patient.  However, when I refer to integration I am talking about the challenge facing palliative care services in terms of integration into existing health care provision models.  When Dame Cicely Saunders initially set up the modern hospice movement, she felt she had to move from the existing acute hospital structure in order to develop the model of hospice care.  Her ultimate aim was to mainstream the process into acute hospital care.  The next challenge for palliative care services is to see us do this, and there are many benefits both to patients and to the efficiency and effectiveness of specialist palliative care services in delivering that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400018#U00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Doiminic &Oacute; Brannag&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1382611500,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I apologise as Senator MacSharry is manning the benches in the Seanad and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has to attend another committee meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400018#U00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382611500,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and acknowledge the work they do.<\/p> <p>I mention Marymount Hospice in Cork, which is highly regarded.

One cannot provide palliative care at any cost but on its own merits, the arguments are there that it should be provided.  I stand over the good news about the economics of it.  That figure of 20% dates back prior to 2008 when so much pressure came on our finances.  Whatever savings were made in the acute hospitals would be mirrored in the hospices.  Our budgets would be 15% lower than five years ago and yet we are delivering more in the way of activity.  We are very conscious of cost in palliative care.  It is not about providing whatever one can for every patient; it has to be done on a business basis.<\/p><p>  We work very closely with the HSE.  Every provider has difficulties in fighting its case and protecting its budget but there is a willingness on the part of the HSE to engage.  It was involved in the baseline study and in the 2001 report and it has a framework document on how to deliver the extra beds and where they are needed.  It has costed all of that.  Obviously over the past five years, there was not much progress towards that but, nevertheless, these are its documents which it is anxious to implement.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Donnell asked about the mix.  The voluntary sector has provided 81%.  I say \"we\" because, as Deputy McLellan said, it is the people of Ireland who contribute.  It is not, by any means, our money.  The people contribute 31% of the running cost of the voluntary inpatient units but they contribute 81% of the capital costs.  There is project in Tralee, which is one of the 16 capital projects and one of the eight inpatients units to be built.  The Kerry Hospice Foundation has committed to providing 100% of the capital cost on the understanding that the HSE will come on board with the revenue, which is the hard bit.<\/p> <p>There is a good partnership that delivers.  There are active projects, with one on the books in Waterford and others in Castlebar and Kerry.  Things are happening.  Blanchardstown is ready to go, having been funded 100% on the capital side from donations.  Negotiations are ongoing with the HSE as to how to open those 24 beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400019#V00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382612700,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Dwyer stated in his presentation that 30% of funding for his organisation comes from volunteers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400020#W00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382612700,"counter":739,"content":"<p>No; I will clarify that point.

We also run education courses as part of our remit to deliver the skills needed for general as well as specialist palliative care, and we generate income from that.  Perhaps it is not the case for all of us, but certainly in Cork we have had to charge for car parking.

It is difficult because it is a complex area.  The HSE is quite fragmented in terms of budgets and so on.  When one looks at the total system perspective rather than at individual components, there are potential savings to be made in the acute hospitals and so on from the effective use of palliative care.<\/p><p>  Another difficulty is that we are in fiscally challenging times.  Sometimes there has to be an outlay to get a return, which is very difficult at present.  It has been demonstrated - particularly in Canada, which has quite a similar model of palliative care to ours - that when such care is resourced properly by empowering patients and providing high-quality care overall there is a reduced call for services.  To extrapolate, this works if patients can access the care they need at home rather than having to present themselves to a hospital late at night, where no records are available, where they have tests done that may not need to be done, getting very expensive care that may not be the most dignified or comfortable care for them.  That is not an efficient use of resources.  The arguments lie in that area.  <\/p><p>  It is important to point out that there are costs, however, and although there may be savings overall, offering patients choice is also important.  As Professor &Oacute; Brannag&aacute;in said, some patients, perhaps those with a cancer diagnosis, will spend a lot of their time in an acute hospital and this may be the right place for them to die.  They know the staff and are familiar with the services.  We have to be careful about suggesting that all people need to die at home.  The choice is theirs and it is contingent on other things.  It may be related to whatever issues they are dealing with at the time, be these psychological or medical.<\/p><p>  I will address a few of the other points made about the services that are provided in acute hospitals.  We are fortunate that every acute hospital in the country provides palliative care, with palliative medicine consultants and palliative care nurse specialists in attendance.  There are some deficits.  The advantage in doing it this way, judging by my personal experience, is that we can facilitate the effective discharge of patients.  Where families feel empowered such discharges are much more likely to be successful, from the perspective of the patient and the family, rather than having the revolving door scenario where somebody goes out and comes back in again 24 hours later because the discharge was rushed or things were missed in the details or in the planning of the services required at home. <\/p><p>  Senator Crown asked about consultant numbers in Ireland.  These are comparable with developed health care systems in the UK and Canada, but it is important to realise that we are seeing an increasing need for palliative care.  As Professor &Oacute; Brannag&aacute;in pointed out, given the increased work in acute hospitals and in dealing with people who have a multitude of illnesses, there may be a need for more consultants and other staffing resources, as well as in our fabric or infrastructure in terms of hospice beds and having community support beds to empower patients to be where they want to be, which is ideally as close as possible to where their families want them.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Donnell's point is very important.  A hospice is not the right place for everybody.  It is about offering choice rather than being prescriptive, saying to people that if they have such and such a condition they should go to this or that place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400020#W00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Creedon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382612700,"counter":741,"content":"<p>In Ireland we have a ratio of one bed to 130,000 people.

I will pick up on some of the points.  When we talk about palliative care not taking place in a geographical location and about going to wherever the patient is, we need to bear a few things in mind.  One is that we must be a little careful about the fact that the place a patient is in, particularly the place where he or she dies, is a very simple piece of information.  It is black and white.  One died at home or one did not; one died in hospital or one did not.  We can access that information relatively easily because it is on the death notification form.  We can get it from the Central Statistics Office.  There is so much complexity around this point, however.  When people are asked where they would like to be cared for, or to die, so many what-ifs are built into that.  If somebody were to ask me that question I might say my choice would be at home, ideally, but that would only be so if I had about ten other different conditions satisfied.  The way we interpret that information is important.  When we talk about bringing palliative care to where the patient is, we must remember that the patient will be in many different places and circumstances throughout his or her illness.  I echo what Dr. Creedon said about what we might say when we are talking about this as an abstract concept, when we would say home was the ideal.  Home is not always the ideal, however.  It very much depends.<\/p><p>  What do we know about home palliative care?  I refer to the evidence on this because it is so very difficult to gather evidence on the effectiveness of palliative care.  The outcomes we effect are about matters such as comfort and quality of life, which are very difficult to measure.  We know from a large review that brought together the results of 23 international studies that patients who received home palliative care services had significantly better symptom profiles and were more than twice as likely to die at home, with all the provisos we have mentioned.<\/p><p>  I pick up on the point about education.  We were talking, appropriately so, about education and training.  We would need to have a broad view of that because such education and training take place in so many different ways.  Of course it is about formal education, both undergraduate and postgraduate, and about training programmes.  However, there is quite a lot of educational support that takes place in terms of the care of individual patients.  I spoke earlier about the fact that palliative care and specialist palliative care are not synonymous.  Not every patient who gets palliative care needs the direct care of a specialist palliative care team, but they need the specialist palliative care service to be sufficiently resourced to care directly for those who have more complex needs and also to provide that education we called \"shared learning\".  It is a two-way process when we talk about educating our colleagues in other specialties.<\/p> <p>There is an ongoing education and support role in terms of the care of individual patients.  It is quite right that we are considering what we need to prioritise.  I was asked specifically about home palliative care.  I suppose we need to be very careful.  At a time of scarce resources, when it might feel like less money is available for research funding, research is more important than ever.  When we are prioritising, we have to know that we are putting time and money into interventions that improve patient outcomes.  This means it is more crucial than ever to measure such outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400020#W00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Clifford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382613300,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to the specific question that was asked about clinical information systems.  Those of us involved in palliative care are fortunate to have a minimum data set for specialist palliative care activity and some activity in palliative care support beds around the country.  The value of the minimum data set is limited because a paper-based system is used by many services.  The minimum data set predominantly counts the number of patients who are seen, rather than more sophisticated measures such as the quality of the patient experience and the outcomes of the care they receive.  A move towards an electronic system to support that would free up front-line staff to provide care.  It would also allow an expansion of the quantity and quality of data collected.<\/p><p>  If we are to focus on the idea of continuity of care in clinical information systems, we need to promote the transfer of information across the various settings of care.  Essentially, we want the patient and his or her family to have a seamless journey of care.  At the moment, information is limited and restricted to the individual settings where patients find themselves.  It would be of huge benefit if we had the ability to facilitate the electronic transfer of information across systems.<\/p><p>  The out-of-hours issue is also of relevance to clinical information systems.  If general practitioners or primary care teams that are looking after patients had a facility that enabled them to communicate effectively with out-of-hours services, including ambulance, emergency department and specialist palliative care services, and if patients were able to register their preferences regarding the place where they receive care or the type of care they might receive in the event of an unanticipated out-of-hours situation, it would be of huge benefit in improving the quality of care provided to patients.<\/p><p>  The majority of patients are treated in their own homes.  One of the quality performance indicators used in Scotland is the percentage of time that a patient spends at home in the last year of his or her life.

Additional infrastructure would be necessary to facilitate its development.  If this is done, one of the main limitations will be overcome.  We know from Our Lady's Hospice and St. Francis Hospice, which are the two service providers in Dublin, that 80% of our referrals originate in acute hospital settings.  The majority of the care we provide to them is provided in their own homes in the community setting.  If I recollect the figures from the minimum data set correctly, approximately 8,000 new patients would have received community palliative care services over the course of a year.  Approximately 2,000 patients would have been admitted to an inpatient unit, perhaps for two or three weeks before returning home again.<\/p><p>  I was asked what I would prioritise in terms of improving community palliative care provision.  The staffing issue is a critical one.  We need to address the deficiencies in community clinical nurse specialists and, importantly, the allied health professionals within the team.  The education of other general palliative care practitioners in the community would also support improved care in the community.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about the range and depth of palliative care services in acute hospitals.  We have specialist palliative care teams in all model 4, model 3 and - potentially - model 2 hospitals.  If one examines the actual staffing ratios of those teams, one will find that they are usually markedly sub-optimal.  In many cases, there is no more than a sessional commitment on the part of the consultant to the acute hospital setting, the team consists predominantly of clinical nurse specialists, there are low staffing ratios and very few allied health professionals are attached to the specialist palliative care team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400021#X00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382613300,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I would like to echo what has been said about education and training.  My colleagues have covered the other points very well.  I absolutely agree that palliative care principles should underpin all professional education and training in this area.  The HSE has led some work which will facilitate that.  It will be critical to take that forward and make it happen.  If we are broadening out our understanding of what palliative care is and the timescale involved, we also need to broaden out who needs the education and training.  If we broaden out our understanding of palliative care beyond cancer, we will appreciate that it is not confined to just one bit of the whole health system.  In such circumstances, it will become clear that the whole health and social care sector needs education and training.  I suggest that we also need to appreciate the need to learn about and understand families and patients, as well as their carers, neighbourhoods and communities.  I thank the committee for allowing me to make that illustration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400021#X00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Paddie Blaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382613300,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I would like to come back to a couple of issues.  Mr. O'Dwyer spoke about resources.  The minimum need for inpatient beds and staffing that would exist across an entire integrated palliative care programme is described in the report of the national advisory committee.  If we could wave a magic wand tomorrow to provide the additional &euro;75 million that is required to deliver such a programme, we would have a major challenge on our hands because we would not have the staff required to deliver all of those services.  That brings us back to the issue of education; specifically, the question of whether the education that is required in an inpatient context takes place in a specialist palliative care unit, a hospice or an acute hospital.  As has been mentioned, there is no inpatient capacity whatsoever in three areas of the country.  As a result, our ability to train people locally who will stay locally is relatively non-existent.  That might not be appreciated by health care planners when they are considering this challenge.<\/p><p>  I would like to make another point about education.  Palliative care is part of the undergraduate curriculum in many of our medical schools, but not all of them.  A module on palliative care is offered in many of our nursing schools, but not all of them.  Such a module is not provided, in the main, when occupational therapists and physiotherapists, etc., are being trained.  My view is that it should be a mandatory part of the basic formation of all health care professionals that they should have core competencies in palliative care.  The postgraduate training of doctors and nurses in the medical, surgical and paediatric areas should enable them to maintain their skill sets and thereby ensure they are able to provide palliative care for patients in whatever context they are being cared for.<\/p><p>  I would like to respond to Deputy McLellan's question about a public awareness campaign.  There are no plans to ramp up the messages to which I have alluded.  I believe they need to be getting into the public domain.  When most people think about palliative care, they understandably associate it with hospice care.<\/p> <p>However, they do not fully appreciate the health care benefits of early incorporation of a palliative care approach into the care management of the patient.  I am speaking as much for the general public as for health care professionals.  The discussion that takes place needs to be a dynamic process, where the doctor may offer it and the patient is able to respond in an informed way.  This would be helpful and worthwhile.<\/p><p> To return to the issue of the acute hospital and the range and depth of services.  As Drs. Ryan and Creedon have stated, we have some form of specialist palliative care available in all 42 acute receiving hospitals in this country.  However, in the main these are \"in-reach\" services.  Clinical nurse specialists may be based in the hospital, but the numbers are insufficient for the number of acute beds in hospital.  Only a handful of hospitals in the country have a seven-day presence of consultants who can provide a same day response to patients, including out of hours.  This is an issue that must be addressed.<\/p><p> I was asked what my piece about integration back into hospital means.  There is a dichotomy of views in regard to this issue within the palliative care community.  I am not speaking for or advocating an either-or approach, but that both approaches should be adopted.  There is a need for specialist palliative care units and where they exist as stand-alone off hospital campus units, there is no reason there should be any change.  However, we should have an open mind with regard to incorporating specialist palliative care units into acute hospitals also, because of the clear benefits I have ascribed to them.  This discussion is at the early stages here.  This is inconsistent with the approach in North American and mainland Europe, where service provision of inpatient beds is dominant within acute hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013102400021#X00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Doiminic &Oacute; Brannag&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382613900,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presence this morning and for the substantial body of work they presented to us in written form.
