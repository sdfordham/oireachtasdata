Following its publication, the Department of Health initiated a major costing project, involving the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others to examine the cost implications of a change to the particular UHI model proposed in the White Paper.  The reports detailing the estimated cost of this UHI model were published on 18 November 2015.  Having considered the findings, I concluded that the high costs associated with the White Paper model of UHI are not affordable and that further research and cost modelling on the best means to achieve universal health care was needed. <\/p>  <p>  The next phase of research will include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models.  This work will be carried out under the auspices of the joint Department of Health-ESRI three-year research programme on health reform.  Both the research undertaken to date and that planned in the next phase of the costing exercise will assist the next Government in its decisions on the best long-term approach to achieving the shared goal of universal health care.<\/p><p>I should add that when I assumed the office of Minister for Health, I concluded that while progress had and was being made on health reform, the original timeline for implementation of universal health insurance, UHI, was too ambitious.  I also emphasised my commitment to progressing health reform and my determination to push ahead with four key building blocks, namely, the Healthy Ireland strategy and the public health agenda; building sufficient capacity to satisfy unmet demand; the expansion and development of primary and social care; and reforming structures, information and communications technology and financial systems with key initiatives, such as the phased extension of GP care without fees, the establishment of hospital groups and community health organisations, the implementation of activity-based funding and the improved management of chronic diseases.  These all are major milestones on the road to universal health care and have the potential to drive performance improvement and deliver significant benefits in terms of timely access to high-quality care. <br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>Already GP care without fees has been successfully introduced for children under the age of six years and all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees and without being obliged to undergo a means test.  The under-sixes service includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease including asthma and diabetes.  In budget 2016, the Government made financial provision for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged six to 11 years.  It is envisaged this third phase will bring the total number of those eligible for universal GP care without the obligation to be assessed by a means test to approximately 1.2 million people.  The progress made in recent years in introducing universal health care, together with the improvement in public finances, provides a very good basis upon which to plan the next phase of improvement in our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200003#A00600","answer":true,"speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454421900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>A cursory glance at the programme for Government and an analysis of it with the benefit of five years of hindsight shows it is a catalogue of failure.  The two central tenets of health care delivery in Ireland were to be universal health insurance and free GP care for everybody.  There has been an abandonment of the universal health insurance model as was outlined.  It appears to have been parked, even though there is a pretence it is not off the agenda.  However, the bottom line is the Government has failed to implement any part of universal health insurance.  If one moves on to universal GP access, the Minister announced last night he also was delaying or potentially abandoning it because of the lack of capacity in the GP services.  In this D&aacute;il Chamber, Fianna F&aacute;il Members repeatedly and consistently raised the need to enhance the capacity of GP services before any roll-out of universality and were consistently ridiculed as being opposed to it.  However, they were not opposing but were merely highlighting the inadequacies of preparation in bringing about of universal access to GP services.  Such services are not akin to buses in Calcutta, in that one cannot just keep putting things in and expect it to keep filling, as at some stage, something will give.  The reason so many people are on hospital trolleys across Ireland, day in day out, is because GP services cannot cope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200004#B00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1454421900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I do not accept the analysis that people are on hospital trolleys because GP services cannot cope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200004#B00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1454421900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>It is a fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200004#B00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1454421900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That may be true for a small number of patients on trolleys but generally speaking, it is the case that if somebody is on a trolley waiting for a hospital bed, that person is there because he or she has been seen by a doctor, or perhaps by two or three doctors, and those doctors have determined the person requires admission to a hospital.

The point I make is that while there is overcrowding at present in GP practices nationwide, they are incapable of dealing with complex issues.  They are under huge time pressure and if one contemplates ensuring that people are dealt with in the area of least complexity, that is, in the GP services or at home, one must increase primary care capacity.  However, the Government has singularly failed to do this.  All the Government has consistently stated was it intended to roll out universal GP access to everybody.  This has not happened and in the meantime, there has been an undermining of the capacity of GP services nationwide to deliver health care in the primary care setting.<\/p>  <p>  All in all, as this D&aacute;il comes to an end, the Minister must accept the Government's health policy has been a disaster from start to finish.

It is not the entire solution.  The Deputy must bear in mind that if more people are seen in a primary care setting, that may result in more referrals to hospitals.  On one level, more people will be managed in the community but, on another, more illness will be picked up.  If we have much better primary care in Ireland, for example, doctors will start diagnosing the 50,000 to 100,000 undiagnosed diabetics in the community and even if only 10% of them have to be referred to hospital clinics, that will mean an additional 10,000 attendances.  There are interplay factors and people often over-simplify this too much.  There is evidence, although it is less than convincing, that GP care without fees for those under six years of age has resulted in an increase in referrals to paediatric emergency departments.  I would like to see a full season's data before being convinced of that because other factors could be at play, not least the respiratory syncytial virus.<\/p>  <p>  We have learned a great deal from those under six years of age and those over 70 years of age.  It has been a great success but we are learning from it.  There has been an increase in attendances by those under six years of age at GP services and there has been a significant increase in attendances at out-of-hours services.  We have to factor all that into future planning.  It will be necessary to increase the number of GPs over time and, therefore, we need to ensure there is not a mismatch between the increase in the number of GPs and trainees and what we ask them to do.  That is why my party is putting forward proposals that we believe are ambitious but achievable in a five-year period.  I am disappointed that the Deputy's party proposes to stop at six years of age and not extend the scheme further.

It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  As the Deputy is aware, in November 2015 the European Medicines Agency, EMA, completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine which found no evidence of a link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.<\/p>  <p>  However, this does not get away from the fact that these young women are unwell.  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and they may be different in different cases.  The HSE will be in a position to facilitate that access to these services for any children or young adults who may require them.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.  However, due to busy parliamentary and other business it is not always possible to meet all representative groups.

They had their daughters vaccinated and now their daughters are severely unwell and as the Minister says, the side-effects are real.  It is all very well to acknowledge the EMA review of the drug but it only examined it for two side-effects and did not take into account the full range of symptoms that some of the parents have outlined, anything from a leg tumour to chronic fatigue and so on.  The problem is that while it is all very well to say they can access health care and support services if they are ill it is not as straightforward as that, particularly when means testing or reliance on private health care come into play.  The parents who attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children wondered how they would meet their daughters&rsquo; medical needs in the years to come.  They looked for long-term treatment plans.  Families cannot cope with the ongoing need to go to doctors, specialists, never mind hospital stays and medication.  They need to explore alternative options for schooling and education because some of these young women cannot get out of bed.  They want exemptions for the leaving certificate and all such supports which might not be available.  It is much bigger than that.  We are on the eve of an election and the parents may have met the HSE but they need urgent assessment and assistance to meet these needs now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200012#K00500","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1454425800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>What I said is that their symptoms are real and they are unwell and nobody is suggesting for a second that anyone is making anything up, or that any of the young women is doing so.

That is a belief not something that is based in evidence or fact, or at least as we understand it.<\/p>  <p>  I remember not that long ago a similar vaccine scare around the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine and some people believing that it caused autism because children developed autism at around the same time as they were getting that vaccine.  Some may even still believe it.  That does not stack up in evidence.  The doctor who originally made those claims was struck off for falsifying some of the research.  As a result of that parents were scared off giving their children the MMR vaccine, or in some cases, for whatever reasons, decided to give separate vaccines.  It is very important that we as parliamentarians are careful not to give credence to something like that happening again.  We can keep an open mind on new evidence but we should not give credence to anything that may discourage parents from giving this vaccine to their daughter to prevent her getting cancer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200012#K00600","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1454426400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The question was very carefully worded and asked what support the Minister would give to the young women who we all agree are undoubtedly unwell at the moment.

In total, there was a 9% increase in emergency department attendances throughout January, which is an enormous increase.  This has eased in recent days and, fingers crossed, that will continue.

In order to reduce the number of patients having to attend emergency departments, community intervention teams and services have been expanded.  The HSE has also driven a number of initiatives to expand hospital capacity.  Some 338 hospital beds are being opened or re-opened, and more than 750 new nurses and 80 new consultants have been employed in the health service during 2015.  Also, there have been additional measures in 2015 to support timely patient discharge from hospital, including reducing waiting times for nursing home places to four weeks, an additional 4,002 transitional care places, 224 public community beds and 2,250 home care packages.

The majority of the &euro;18 million investment programme was spent in County Wexford on Tara House community mental health centre in Gorey, which is a day hospital; Tus Nua rehabilitation unit in Enniscorthy, which has 12 beds; Heavenview, which is a 14-bed unit; Millview, which is a 12-bed intellectual disability and rehabilitation unit in Enniscorthy; Farnogue psychiatry of later life unit and team headquarters, Wexford, which has 20 designated psychiatry of old age beds and 30 beds designated as part of the community nursing unit for the care of the older person; and the upgrade of Summerhill community unit, Wexford.  <\/p><p>A Vision for Change recommends that as part of community secondary care provision, there should be a crisis house available in each catchment area.  In July 2014, a new purpose built ten-bed crisis respite unit, seven day service, An Tearmann, opened in Enniscorthy for service users who are referred there through their mental health community team for respite care.  I have already outlined the mental health services in operation in Wexford.  <\/p><p>In addition, Wexford has recently received substantial funding which will enable it to continue into the future, a service of which I am sure the Deputy is very well aware.  The mental health services in Wexford and the surrounding areas are now developing an infant mental health service for the area which is in compliance with A Vision for Change.  One of the models we should look at in future should include respite and crisis houses and the type of innovative development that we see in Wexford.  It is the Deputy&rsquo;s job not to be satisfied but there has been substantial investment in Wexford and a completely new type of service.  <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The Waterford-Wexford Mental Health Services serves a population of approximately 278,000.  The extended catchment geographic area stretches from Gorey in north Wexford to Youghal in County Cork.  Mental Health Services in Wexford are arranged in accordance with national policy as reflected in A Vision for Change.  The HSE, in addition to emergency and hospital care and community based services, has a comprehensive range of services available to people in Wexford in the areas of mental health, suicide prevention and substance misuse. <\/p><p>Following a closure order in 2010 from the Mental Health Commission, the acute mental health unit in St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital, Enniscorthy was amalgamated with Waterford Mental Health Services and is now provided for in a 44-bed acute in-patient unit in University Hospital Waterford.  In addition, arrangements are in place whereby service users in north Wexford who attend Tara House mental health services in Gorey and require acute in-patient admission have access to five beds in Newcastle Hospital, Greystones, County Wicklow.  To support the amalgamation of acute mental health services, a comprehensive &euro;18 million capital investment programme was implemented, with the main developments taking place in County Wexford.  These, for example, relate to additional bed provision or enhancement of facilities such as Tara House in Gorey, Tus Nua, Heavenview and Millview in Enniscorthy; and the Farnogue psychiatry of old age care unit and Summerhill community mental health unit in Wexford.<\/p><p>The Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse, or SCAN, service in Wexford is a skilled mental health nursing service for Primary Care.  This provides an accessible and quick response to GP requests for a timely assessment of those in suicide or self harm distress.  The emergency department in Wexford General Hospital has a seven-day liaison nurse led service.  In addition, and in line with catchment area criteria recommended in A Vision for Change, a new purpose-built ten-bed crisis respite unit has been opened in Enniscorthy.  Many of the services I have outlined, and others in the area, operate a seven-day service, with significant opening hours.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the significant and comprehensive service developments that have taken place or are currently planned for the Waterford-Wexford Mental Health Service area as a whole will ensure the provision of quality and patient focused mental health care across the region.  In light of this, there are no plans at present to provide the type of service suggested by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200017#P01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1454428800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>It is not my job to be dissatisfied.

He was brought to Wexford General Hospital by ambulance.  A few hours later, the hospital telephoned Christine and told her she would have to take Shane to St. Vincent's for surgery because he had severed two nerves in his wrist.  At St. Vincent's they had to wait five hours on a trolley in A&amp;E before he was seen.  They carried out the surgery there but would not admit him to the psychiatric unit because he is from Wexford and outside the catchment area.  As Shane has been diagnosed with a personality disorder, he is not deemed to be a threat to himself and is excluded from involuntary admission to treatment under the Mental Health Act.

It is known that this foster home or household to which children were sent for summer respite services was so engaged from 1983 to approximately 1996, when it ceased taking new placements, but that Grace was left there until 2009 and that another person, Ann, was left there until 2013.  The abuse has been described as quite shocking - it genuinely would shock any person - and it is incomprehensible that a child would be left for so long in such a dangerous household.  I have been watching the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts this morning and the various questioning to and fro there.  My first point is that the whistleblowers are clear that serious abuse was perpetrated on those children in the 1990s and, if I understand the matter correctly, even though files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for some reason no prosecutions took place.  Therefore, the first question I ask of the Taoiseach is whether there may be mechanisms whereby the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions could be asked to give a report explaining why these cases did not materialise into prosecutions on foot of the files that were sent.  I understand from one report this morning that five files were sent to the DPP during that period.

As I understand it, it is possible for a commission of investigation to proceed in parallel to the Garda inquiry though it might mean that when the commission report is completed, it might not be possible to publish it in full pending elements of whatever might emerge from the aforementioned Garda inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm to Deputy Martin that the Government discussed this matter today and had briefings from both the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and agreed on the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation, subject to terms of reference and approval by the Oireachtas.  That will be the next Oireachtas, whoever the people elect.  The work that is under way, which was commissioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, with Mr. Conor Dignam, SC, will be expected to form part of the drafting of the terms of reference for a commission of investigation.  Additional resources have been made available for the senior counsel to allow him to accelerate completion of his report, which now is due by the end of April.  I might note that both the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, have requested copies of both the Devine and the Resilience Ireland report from the HSE under section 40C of the Health Act 2004.  Both Ministers believe direct access to these reports will assist their understanding of the relevant facts that are needed about the disturbing allegations that have been made.  As the Deputy is aware, officials from the HSE are engaged with the Committee of Public Accounts at present.  It speaks for itself that it is a committee of this House charged with dealing with monetary matters which has brought this matter to light here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200018#Q01600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1454429400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>While I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, my core point is on the capacity of a commission of investigation to credibly carry out its work while the Garda investigation is under way.  Presumably, a presiding judge might be highly wary of undermining the Garda inquiry.  This was the very basis on which the HSE officials appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts have stated that much as they would wish to so do, they cannot publish the Devine or Resilience Ireland reports because of the possibility of endangering the criminal inquiry.  Has the Taoiseach received strong and robust legal advice from the Attorney General to state that a commission of investigation can conduct an inquiry?  The Taoiseach has confirmed it cannot publish the results of the inquiry until after the Garda investigation is complete but can it actually conduct an inquiry?  For example, the witnesses to such an inquiry may very well plead that they are involved in a criminal case and that they could be questioned by the Garda and so on.  Will they be under an obligation, in a parallel mechanism, to give evidence to the judge?  It is a serious issue in itself because the robustness of the Commissions of Investigation Act has been called into question because of the Siteserv experience.  Likewise, Members had another experience in a separate inquiry, the bank inquiry, in which banking officials could not be brought forward because of criminal proceedings in the courts.

Roscommon lost part of its county 100 years ago over the Gaelic Athletic Association when people from Ballaghaderreen played for the red and green instead of Roscommon but that is a different matter, as the Deputy is well aware.  What I want - whoever the people decide to elect - is to keep the benefits of a rising economy being invested throughout the country.  Roscommon is a county that has suffered much in recent years.  Many elements of that were due to a lack of decisiveness about what actually needed to be done in Roscommon in terms of the major pieces of infrastructure, road routes and so on.  Monksland is a developed and thriving area in terms of investment and the creation of jobs.  I agree with the Deputy that people would be very upset were it to be shifted administratively to another district.  I am very much a supporter of developing the county of Roscommon as an entity.  Why would I not be?  That is my strong belief.  This report is not binding; it is an administrative report and will have to be dealt with politically afterwards.

In the immediate aftermath of those atrocities, I reiterated in the strongest terms Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for, and solidarity with, France and the French people, with whom Ireland has a dynamic and historic relationship.  I wrote in those terms to President Hollande, and I signed the book of condolences at the French embassy, where I met the ambassador.  In this House, on 17 November, we observed a minute&rsquo;s silence for the victims and I delivered a statement setting out our sympathy and our resolve to stand with France, confirming that we are united in our determination to counter the threat posed by global terrorism.  The Irish public also demonstrated their sympathy and solidarity through vigils, through walks of solidarity and through letters and cards sent by individuals and by entire schools to the French embassy in Ireland and other French institutions.  The ambassador attended the D&aacute;il on 17 November and met with a number of senior officials, including the Second Secretary General of my Department to discuss follow-up actions.<\/p>  <p>  European Union Justice and Foreign Ministers and leaders also discussed the attack and its consequences at their subsequent meetings.  At the European Council in December, I and other Heads of State and Government took stock of progress since February, when a detailed programme of criminal justice, law enforcement and border control actions was set out.  The central point of our discussions was that the EU has to deliver on the measures and priorities already agreed.  Building on the work of Justice Ministers, the European Council looked at enhancing information sharing and early implementation of the passenger name record, PNR, directive.  Further emphasis was placed on systematic and co-ordinated checks at external borders, which primarily concerned the Schengen area members, and a commitment to examining Commission proposals on new directives for combating terrorism and the illegal firearms trade.  Proposals were also made for increasing the effectiveness of the fight against terrorist financing.  Work on these issues is continuing as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for a co-ordinated international response and a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism.  In this regard, it was welcome that the European Council discussions and conclusions proposed the stepping up of engagement with partners in north Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and the western Balkans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200021#T00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1454431200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I also want to begin by condemning in the strongest possible terms the murderous attacks perpetrated in Paris in November.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, our party president, Deputy Gerry Adams, vice president, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, and justice spokesperson, Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, at the time visited the French embassy and extended our personal sympathies and solidarity to the French ambassador, the victims, their families and the people of Paris and France.  The people of this island, like those all over the world, watched in deep shock and horror the events as they unfolded in Paris last November.  All of us must stand against fundamentalism, bigotry, sectarianism and racism.<\/p>  <p>  Tragically, the violence that was witnessed in Paris has been mirrored in countless other barbaric acts.  The catalogue of deadly actions makes for very grim reading.  Only last Sunday, three bombs killed 45 people in Damascus.  Three weeks ago, ten German tourists were killed and another 17 people wounded in a bombing in the historic centre of Istanbul.  In the years of war in Syria, more than 300,000 men, women and children, mostly civilians, have been killed.  Last October, twin blasts in Ankara claimed the lives of more than 100 civilians.  In addition, a bomb was responsible for destroying the Metrojet that crashed in the Sinai Peninsula, killing the 224 people on board.<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations recently confirmed that more than 50 million people have been displaced worldwide as a result of conflict and it faces the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  More than 3,500 people have died at sea since last January in making the desperate crossing to Europe.  These victims were ordinary, innocent civilians and, like the citizens in Paris who played no part in any of this, the people of the Middle East are entitled to live in peace and to pursue happiness and prosperity.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a conflict between East and West or between Islam and Christianity, but between fundamentalism and freedom.  It is important that we assert that neither religion, gender, colour nor nationalism can be any excuse for violence.  Injustice, racism and sectarianism must be challenged.  ISIS and other fundamentalist groups thrive on the chaos and destruction that has been wrought in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East as a direct result of Western military and political interference.

Clearly, this has been the focus of the European Council meetings for more than a year.  The root cause of much of this is the war in Syria.  I am glad to see that, at long last, tentative steps towards peace talks are beginning, although it might be some time before they begin to focus on what needs to be done.  The Deputy is aware of the United Nations Secretary General's comments.  The problem with the unprecedented scale of people leaving Syria is not going to end until this problem is dealt with.  Can the Deputy imagine, for instance, if all of Munster and all of Connacht were to walk to Northern Ireland and take rickety boats to Britain or somewhere else?  The scale of evacuation and movement is unprecedented.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what steps are being taken.  The European Union, in particular the Schengen countries, agreed on a process of what they called hotspots for registration and recognition of people.  Great difficulties have been experienced in Italy and even more so in Greece, given the numbers coming across from Turkey.  Deputy O'Brien is aware of the numbers - just more than 1 million in south Lebanon, with 25% of its population now Syrian, 1.2 million in Jordan and more than 2 million in Turkey, with others coming in from other countries through Turkey who want to get to Europe as well.  In respect of the scale of the camps in Turkey, the European Union agreed to put up &euro;3 billion in consultation with the Turkish Government and, in an effort to maintain people in Turkey, the majority of whom would like to go back to Syria if peace were to happen, agreed to open some of the pre-accession chapters for consideration to become an eventual member of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Islam is a religion of peace and should not be confused in the sense of being the cause of this.  The Islamic religion is one of peace.<\/p><p> Ireland stands united with the European Union, as I stated in my response in respect of France.  When we consider that the Assad regime is being maintained by Russia and Iran and that the United States and Europe have supported the removal of that regime, I am not sure what is going to happen in the short term.  While the situation continues, Daesh or ISIS, has continued to carry out these abominable and horrific beheadings and assaults on men, women and children.  These rapes and beheadings and assaults are appalling crimes against humanity.  In that respect, when we see reports of videos making claims of further terrorist activities in different countries, these cause enormous complications.<\/p> <p> As Deputy O'Brien will be aware, the state of emergency continues in Paris, France and is being extended to other areas.  This is causing enormous difficulties for the economy, with reduced visitor numbers and hospitality potential.  Further difficulties will be experienced in regard to the European championships and the huge numbers of fans who will travel from different countries.  Questions will arise as to whether the state of emergency should be maintained following the declaration of war by the French President.  These serious issues must be fully considered.<\/p> <p> In so far as we are concerned, shortly after the French atrocity, a meeting of the appropriate emergency committee was held here and it was briefed on security and other developments.  These matters and information are monitored carefully by the Garda Commissioner and intelligence units here.  In that regard, Palestine has always been a case in point.  The attitude adopted now is that the two-state solution should apply but clearly there are strong differences of opinion about the substantial Israeli settlements on the West Bank, involving thousands of people.  These issues are all part of the discussions that take place on the occasion of every Council meeting and between them.  High Representative Federica Mogherini provides reports to the Council.<\/p> <p>   Clearly, we also consider the entire Middle East, the situation now with Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries, the numbers of people on the Libyan shore wanting to cross the Mediterranean, the war in Syria, the war on terrorism and the capacity of Daesh or ISIL to radicalise young people without having to visit a country.  There is also information from many countries and their security forces that particular locations have been visited with a view to the potential to carry out terrorist atrocities.  This is a serious matter.  Any incident carries with it enormous cost, even for example, an incident like that when the Minister for Transport here was contacted last week about the Turkish flight with a suspected bomb on board having to land at Shannon.  There were the difficulties and costs involved in ensuring the aircraft could land safely and be checked out so that the passengers were not in danger on their onward journey.  This was just one incident, so we can only imagine the situation in France, with serious frustration being expressed by air traffic controllers, taxi drivers on strike, direct threats from Daesh and the migrant crisis in Calais where serious numbers of children are without parents.  This is one of the most serious issues affecting the European Union in a long time and has even threatened the Schengen arrangement.<\/p> <p> Ireland has opted into the protocol and agreed to take significant numbers of Syrian families.  That process is under way but the registration and identification of families to come here has been hampered by the inability to locate these hotspots properly, because the requirement to register people in huge numbers means they must be catered for in the location they are being registered.  This means more camps but many of these people who have landed in Europe just want to move on to Austria, Germany or Sweden.  Ireland does not rank among the desired countries.  We can understand, therefore, the pressure in a country like Germany, where over 1 million refugees have made their way to in the past months.  While it is still winter or early spring, as the warmer weather approaches the numbers of refugees wishing to cross from Turkey to Greece and into Europe will inevitably increase.<\/p> <p> I believe the next meeting of the European Council must focus again on this issue.  It is not easy to solve.  When the tentative peace talks - which I hope work - get under way, I do not believe it will be easy to bring a conclusion to them and bring about an arrangement.  However, it has been shown from speaking to Syrian refugees that the majority of them would like to return to Syrian if the current regime in Damascus was removed.  Therein lies the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200021#T01200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454431800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>This is an important topic and my question, No. 3, relates to it.

It is two and a half months since these questions were tabled.  At the outset of this term of office the Taoiseach halved the number of question sessions and got rid of one day for raising questions.  He also refuses to reschedule sessions he misses.

I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that these attacks were not just targeted at France but at all societies that oppose the extremist fundamentalism of ISIS.  There can be no equivocation on this.  There is no \"on the one hand\" and \"on the other hand\".  This is pure evil and we must be united in confronting it.  In his presentation today and in others, Deputy O'Brien gave the sense that American or western interference is somehow a factor to blame for Daesh's attacks, but that is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200022#U00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1454431800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>It is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200022#U00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1454431800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>It is not true.  There are more fundamental reasons Daesh and ISIL have come to the fore.  It is not because of western interference.  Nothing justifies the nihilism or fundamental callousness involved in these attacks on ordinary citizens in democracies across the world.  Even in states that are not democracies, innocent civilians are being targeted and murdered and armchair generals are organising young people, infiltrating groups and bringing them over and influencing them to commit jihad and appalling suicidal acts against innocent civilians.  I do not buy the \"on the one hand or the other hand\" argument.  A vacuum was created in Iraq and in Syria and through that vacuum, ISIS has emerged.  However, that does not justify what ISIS is doing.<\/p>  <p>  I would be strongly supportive of and sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and do not agree with Israel's approach, but I draw a line at trying to say that conflict is somehow related to how ISIS behaves.  There is no connection or relationship between them.  ISIS is a fundamentalism that needs to be taken on.  There is no logic or rationale to it other than to kill and maim people left, right and centre across the globe.  A dangerous equivocation arises here, however.<\/p><p>That happens if, somewhat simplistically, the West is blamed for actions such as this.  I understand there have been mistakes in foreign policy but, equally, there have been great successes.  President Obama's initiative in his breakthrough with Iran, for example, is a very fundamental shift and it deserves to be lauded as a potential game changer.  It has its critics but it was done with the European Union and other interested parties.  Those talks on the nuclear issue and Iran went on for years and this has the potential to change the world order for the better.  When ISIS or similar groups go to France or elsewhere, we rely on other democracies that share common values to pool intelligence and information to enable us to combat this.  This is an evil and fundamentalism of a kind that must be attacked.  We give groups succour when we talk \"on the one hand but on the other hand\".  We need a comprehensive approach and we must be very clear in this House about that.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach referred to peace negotiations but the big issue in such talks remains the attempt to exclude the moderate opposition and Kurdish groups from the discussion.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that in the European Union discussion this month, Ireland will speak up for the right of the moderate opposition in Syria and Kurdish groups to participate in these negotiations?  The degree to which other countries have been attempting to undermine legitimate Kurdish aspirations is unacceptable, even as it goes to the extent of blunting the attack on ISIS in order to allow narrow interests come to the fore.<\/p> <p> The most urgent issue of all remains helping refugees from this conflict.  Current reports are that the humanitarian crisis is getting worse, with international aid clearly insufficient for the scale of the crisis.  Essentially, this is the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century and, at a minimum, we should be demanding at EU level that all refugees should have access to basic humanitarian conditions.  I have raised the point with the Taoiseach before.  The existing camps in Lebanon, Turkey and elsewhere are a factor in the migratory pull to Europe because they are not providing the very basics in terms of education, quality of life, work pathways and some sense of security or a context in which families can be raised with some degree of quality, involving education, access to health facilities and so on.  When these are lacking, families will want to migrate and leave those camps.  A major humanitarian effort is required by the European Union to support those camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and elsewhere and provide those required resources to enable people to sustain themselves with some degree of dignity and quality in those camps.  That would do much to stem the tide of migration that is occurring and which will occur again if something fundamental does not happen with respect to the scale and nature of the humanitarian aid currently being made available globally.<\/p> <p> The most fundamental point is of course that the conflict should be brought to some sort of conclusion, even a cessation of hostilities to enable life to be rebuilt in Syria and controlled by legitimate governments put in place to prevent the continuing exploitation by ISIS of the vacuum created in the current conflicts in Syria and Iraq.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200022#U00600","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454432400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I hope they can be followed through.<\/p>  <p>  I will be happy to make the point at the European Council meeting for the inclusion of the moderate opposition and the Kurdish groups.  We are only a small country but when we had the issue of 30 years of terrorism on this island, it was important to have everybody included in the discussions so as to have their voice heard.  The Good Friday Agreement and the following agreements mean we are still in a position to maintain a peace, although it requires vigilance.  It is a point I am happy to make.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the humanitarian position, we cannot have starvation sieges like we have seen in Madaya; it is absolutely barbaric in this day and age that a situation would apply where deliberate starvation has occurred.  The Deputy knows it is prohibited by the Geneva Convention and all international law.  In 2015 and 2016, to have aid agencies visiting this location and finding people starving is reminiscent of what happened in Poland and other places during World War II.  We have supported very strongly a referral by the UN Security Council of the case in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  It is appalling and there is a need for accountability for the multiple crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Brien mentioned the attack in Istanbul and it must be condemned out of hand.  These attacks represent an attack on everybody's humanity and the liberty and value that a free society presents.  The crimes of mass murder, sexual slavery and ethnic cleansing must be confronted and defeated; there can be no equivocation about that.  There is no disagreement on that.  This country has articulated very strongly our support for international law.  Daesh's systematic crimes against the rights and existence of ethnic, religious, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual and intersex minorities, as well as women and children across the Middle East, must be prevented by all legal means possible.  The barbaric actions of these people are an absolute affront to everybody's common humanity.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that air strikes have been conducted against Daesh in Iraq and Syria for some time and it is for the individual states to determine how they can best contribute to the concerted international effort under way to tackle the threat posed by Daesh and other UN-designated terrorist groups, of which there are many.<\/p><p>Clearly, France took its own action against acts of terrorism directed against its citizens.<\/p> <p> The Security Council clarified the legal grounds for addressing the threat of terrorism in Syria and Iraq.  UN Security Council resolution 2249 grants authority for all states to take necessary action or measures to suppress and eradicate terrorist acts by Daesh and the al-Nusra Front, which is an al-Qaeda affiliate in territory under Daesh control within Syria and Iraq, and to eradicate the safe havens that they appear to have established there.  Any action taken under this resolution therefore has to be in compliance with international law and the UN Charter, including human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.  <\/p> <p> Having welcomed the discussions that are now starting in Geneva, we can issue a call from here that all of these groups would participate fully in the work to provide a basis by which discussions might start towards bringing an end to this conflict.  Despite the exceptional polarity of opinion, if everybody was to focus on people being slaughtered, murdered and forced out of their homeland, there may be an element of agreement at the end of it. <\/p> <p> At the end of 2015, Ireland's support for the Syrian people reached over &euro;42 million, which is the largest response to any crisis in recent years.  It is channelled through the UN, Red Cross and NGOs to be spent on food aid, water, sanitation, shelter, education and protection, including child protection and the prevention of gender-based violence.  That underlines the humanitarian commitment that this country has always shown over the years.  It includes support for the protection of Syrian refugees in Iraq with a focus on gender-based violence being an issue there. <\/p> <p> Ireland's engagement with the global response to counter Daesh is a co-ordinated one from the international community.  An effective response requires the root causes and contributory factors to be addressed, promotes a counter argument, prevents radicalisation, deters and disrupts terrorist travel, addresses terrorist financing, and brings perpetrators to justice.  Our obligations flow from UN Security Council resolutions, such as UNSCR 2161 on freezing the funds and assets of terrorist groupings, and UNSCR 2178 on measures to suppress recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping individuals who travel to one state in order to perpetrate, plan or participate in terrorist activities.  <\/p> <p> The global coalition set up in September 2014 is a mechanism for co-ordinating all of that international partnership in what is called \"lines of effort\".  Other neutral countries, like Austria, Finland and Sweden, participate in activities that are co-ordinated by the coalition.  There are no obligations arising from our participation in the global coalition which involves sharing information and views.<\/p> <p> Ireland is not, and will not be, participating in any international military action to combat Daesh.  Our primary focus is on the political and humanitarian process.  As everybody is aware, this is an appalling tragedy and it will not be easy to figure out where the conclusion lies.<\/p> <p> The Deputy mentioned camps in Turkey and Jordan.  From speaking to people there, I know a great deal of money is being spent on facilities for children, education and maternity services.  Thousands of expectant mothers have given birth in these camps in Jordan and other locations.  Apparently, despite the fact that they are camps, a great deal of expenditure is going there to help alleviate the difficulties that people have.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Martin mentioned the migratory pull towards Europe, which is true.  However, it is also a fact that people who went into the camps in Jordan and Turkey in the first instance have now been there for some time.  They have seen others making their way to Germany, Austria and Sweden with a perception that there is a better standard of living and better facilities available to them.  That applies pressure on those left behind who now say they want to leave as well.  That issue has arisen because of that factor.  <\/p> <p> As regards participating in these measures at the European Council, I confirm that I will be happy to articulate these views on behalf of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200023#V01700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454433000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The monstrous atrocities in Paris at the end of 2015 revolted the vast majority of humanity, including people in the Moslem world.  It is vital to understand that, given that the perpetrators claim to act in the name of Allah, the god of those who believe in Islam.  Does the Taoiseach agree, nevertheless, that one has to put the horror now unfolding in the Middle East, and all the consequences that follow around the world, in the context of the legacy of intervention in the Middle East by major imperial powers, from both east and west, historically over centuries?  They jockeyed for power and stole resources from people in the region.  <\/p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach also agree that one must factor in more recent interventions in the past 20 years, particularly by western powers, and now Russia as well?  I am speaking in particular about the criminal invasion of Iraq, as a major factor that has unleashed forces that are wreaking havoc, particularly on ordinary, poor, working people in the Middle East, including Iraq, Syria and other areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader has a brass neck to lecture some of us here, as if we were putting forward some kind of justification for the atrocities in Paris, because we seek to explain what creates such politically crazed individuals who can carry out atrocities like that.  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il himself carries responsibility by virtue of his presence in the Government of Mr. Bertie Ahern who, in 2003, supported the invasion of Iraq.  On many occasions in this House, he gave credence to the lies that were being put abroad internationally about weapons of mass destruction.  He then gave logistical support to that criminal invasion by the US army by virtue of allowing it to use Shannon Airport.  He therefore carries some responsibility for this horror.  <\/p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach agree that these disastrous interventions have created the basis for the reactionary forces of ISIS?  The unfortunate situation is that a medievalist and barbaric world view can get an echo among a people seriously alienated by the actions of western powers, as well as Russia.  When an atrocity like that in Paris occurs, it is world news.<\/p><p>It is massively denounced but is the Taoiseach aware that, on a weekly basis, innocent men, women and children are being killed by drones sent in by the US and other powers and are unmourned and unreported and that this creates a basis of support for some of the forces at play?  <\/p> <p> Closer to home, is it not a real condemnation of the EU that the mass unemployment of 25 million or 26 million people that has been endemic for many years and the marginalisation and alienation this creates in communities in major cities such as Brussels, Paris and elsewhere throws up people who can carry out such horrific attacks as were perpetrated during the Paris massacre?  Those to whom I refer are so embittered and alienated that they look to reactionary forces such as ISIS as some way to lash back not just at intervention in the Middle East but also at what their own governments are imposing on society, particularly in recent years, in the context of mass austerity.  <\/p> <p> Does the Taoiseach agree that the lesson is that interference in the Middle East should cease forthwith?  Does he agree that Russia, the US, Great Britain and the rest should get out and allow the people of the Middle East deal with kleptocrats within their societies who have seized power and who routinely steal from their people by means of their corrupt regimes?  This would be done on the basis of the people being empowered to take ownership of their wealth, rather than it going to multinational oil companies, and to use their countries' fabulous resources to create prosperity for themselves.  Is this not really the basis on which peace can be created, namely, by developing a society in which there is no poverty, hunger or oppression and, very importantly, where there is political and religious freedom?  That is the basis on which this horror can be resolved.  Unfortunately, Western powers have nothing to contribute.  In fact, they have contributed to the existing horror and will continue to do so if they proceed to intervene and interfere in the way they have done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200024#W00200","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454433600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins has delivered a history lecture.  Obviously, the process of colonisation over many hundreds of years has led to bloody warfare and inter-country and inter-tribal wars on so many occasions.  History speaks for itself.  The Deputy will recall the discussions that took place in 1938 about the protection of the Jewish people and that all the countries in Europe represented at &Eacute;vian said that this should happen and spoke about what they were prepared to do.  When Hitler invaded the Sudetenland in 1939, 160,000 to 200,000 people were displaced.  During the Holocaust commemorative ceremony at the Mansion House last week, which was attended by the Ceann Comhairle, one of the graphic pictures depicted the <i>MS St. Louis<\/i>, a transport ship that left for the US with 900 passengers who were eventually refused entry to that country and had to return to Europe.  Another ship went to Turkey with 700 people, most of whom drowned.  History repeats itself in so many ways.<\/p><p>We cannot go back.  We must deal with the situation as it obtains and it is exceptionally difficult, be it from an historical, a tribal or a religious point of view.  I recall the comments of Hans Blix who said that if he had another three or four months and was allowed to finish his report, he could prove that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  That did not happen.  The Deputy rightly points out what he calls politically crazed individuals.  How does this happen?  If young people in particular are left to fester in ghettoes or enclaves, they will not emerge from them as model citizens after 20 years.  It does not work that way with human nature and pressure, resentment, frustration and anger can lead to all kinds of difficulties, including violence or terrorist activities such as those we have witnessed on the Continent in recent times.  This issue is difficult to resolve in terms of integration and the opportunities or capacity to integrate people properly that should exist.  Clearly, it is a lesson that has been learned to a great extent in terms of a missed opportunity to at least attempt to bring new citizenship with the mainstream and not have this situation arise.<\/p><p>We will not see the pullout of the different countries and powers to which the Deputy referred.  International politics, diplomacy and interests will not shift just like that.  People are being bombed, murdered, mutilated and beheaded and others are migrating in huge numbers to the European mainland in order to get away from what is happening in Syria.  They are coming up to Libya from the Horn of Africa, Eritrea, Mali and other places in huge numbers and seeking the opportunity to come to Europe.<\/p><p>The Deputy is a good historian.  The lessons of history are never learned easily and it requires strong leadership and the capacity to bring very polarised people together with a common interest.  Unfortunately, it will not happen that easily.  We can point to our own troubled history as a model of what must apply in order to bring people together.  When George Mitchell was sent here by former US President Bill Clinton, who would have thought that an agreement would be reached that would still be in place almost 30 years later?  There is no point in saying that it cannot be done, cannot be faced into or that an outcome cannot be arrived at.  Of course, all of this can happen.  What does anybody want to do at the end of day except have the opportunity to live in peace?  Those men, women and children we see on television screens every day and night of the week have the same aspirations and as a result of the situation that obtain in their home countries, they give up everything and move to places that are safer for them and their children.  If international diplomacy and politics and the UN are to mean anything, then the latter must use all its resources and facilities to bring about a better situation for the millions of people involved.  Unfortunately, crises move from place to place, from year to year and from period to period.  Each one requires enormous resolve from so many international countries.  We no longer hear about the Crimea, eastern Ukraine and other areas where there is serious pressure.  However, when successive human catastrophes occur, matters come into sharp focus in the context of the global situation.  This is the case with regard to the difficulties in Syria and surrounding countries such as Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Those difficulties have consequences for international politics.  Obviously, the money spent on all the conflicts in question would in most cases be sufficient to repair the infrastructures of the countries involved.  However, that does not reflect the reality.  We must focus on what is possible.  If the lessons of history can teach us what went wrong, they can also teach us how to go about getting it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200025#X00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","time":1454434200,"counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200026#Y00100"},{"type":"question","time":1454434200,"counter":228,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[43468\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200026#Y00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if the end to baptism barriers for school entry was discussed when he last met church leaders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1454434200,"counter":229,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[3918\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200026#Y00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the discussions he has had with church leaders and others regarding the practice of parents having to get their children baptised in order to gain entry to the school of their choice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1454434200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.<\/p>  <p>  Like public representatives generally, I often meet religious and non-religious leaders informally in the course of attending official and public events.

He is very fond of talking about some anniversaries.  As he is aware, it will soon be five years since the first Minister for Education and Skills in this Government announced that 50% of schools would change patronage in 2012.  That is another example of a government that has rushed out with announcements irrespective of what was prepared or agreed.  The Government decided to take a confrontational approach to this issue and, as a result, progress has been set back by years.  We went from a position where the largest diocese in the country was prepared to transfer half of its schools to other patrons to one where only a handful have been transferred.  A great deal of time and effort have been wasted on a pointless conflict.  I have no doubt that we can agree a means of respect for diversity in our schools and that we can get all patrons to sign up to this but we need a formal end to the policy of pandering to some imagined gallery with empty tough talk about existing patrons.

I have been in many Catholic and Church of Ireland schools where people of many faiths and none attend.  It is not beyond the Minister or the Government to ensure that principle is applied, that baptism is not a barrier to enrolment because that would offend anyone&rsquo;s sense of basic decency and common sense or the sense of inclusivity in a parish or community.

Parents can choose which school to send their children to and where the school has available places, the pupils should be admitted.  Where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  That selection process, and the enrolment policy on which it is based, have to be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  This may result in some pupils not achieving a place.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputies that a baptismal certificate should not be the criterion but Catholic schools accommodate all applications, regardless of religion or none when there is room available to do so.<\/p><p>This is about common sense.  The phenomenon of pupils being unable to secure a place of their choice occurs only where there is an oversubscription to a particular school.  Baptismal certificates may be used by Catholic and Protestant patrons in these circumstances to demonstrate denomination so that oversubscribed schools with a particular religious ethos can offer places to pupils within the denomination.<\/p> <p> Everybody is aware of the Educate Together movement which obviously provides an opportunity for many of the parents, who have an issue here, to send their children to school.  From an historical point of view, if there are three or four Catholic schools in a location, it is difficult to get parents or boards of management to agree that a particular school should be divested to any other patronage.  That is an issue that always requires some sensitive discussions.

Last week on Joe Duffy's radio show, Ms Martina Kelly spoke harrowingly about her experience as a self-employed person.  She outlined how a sudden and debilitating condition negatively impacted on her personal well-being but also left her penniless due to the absence of a social security safety net.  It is striking that the Government has made no effort to implement the Mangan report prepared by an advisory group on tax and social welfare about extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed.  It was published in May 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Essentially, it stated that in international terms, Ireland is unusual in not providing state supports for the self-employed in the event of injury or illness.  In most EU member states, provision is afforded to the self-employed to cover occupational injuries or sickness.<\/p>  <p>  The group was of the view that social insurance for the self-employed should be extended to provide cover in terms of contingencies related to long-term illness.  This is the very point that Ms Martina Kelly made on Joe Duffy's \"Liveline\" programme last week.  If the Taoiseach gets a chance, he should listen to the podcast.  I believe Ms Kelly may have rung the Taoiseach, as did her husband.  It is an extraordinarily sad and difficult story for all concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendation is that the extension of social insurance to self-employed to provide cover for long-term ill-health or incapacity should be on a compulsory basis.  Why did the Government not proceed to legislate for that recommendation of the report?  The Taoiseach made a very important commitment to do something for the self-employed but very little has happened at a time when we are encouraging people to become self-employed and self-starters.<\/p>  <p>  On a related issue, the programme for Government makes a commitment that: \"Universal primary care (UPC) will remove fees for GP care and will be introduced within this government&rsquo;s term of office.\"  This commitment has now been abandoned by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, similar to what happened with universal health insurance.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said that free GP care would not be deliverable in the next five years.  In the 2011 programme for Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised to deliver it by 2016.  Now, before a general election, we have the new phenomenon of Ministers predicting that even in the next five years, it will not be implementable either.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that chapter of the programme for Government is complete fiction?  Clearly, it will not be implementable in this D&aacute;il but now what was proposed in 2011 will not even be implementable in the next five years to 2021.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200027#Z00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1454434800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point on the self-employed, obviously, the Government is well aware of the anomaly that has existed here for some time, with hundreds of thousands of self-employed people without any safety net.  I understand completely the difficulties being experienced by self-employed people if something like this happens.  That is why the Government started to address this in the recent budget, hopefully to eliminate the anomaly in terms of tax that has been there between self-employed and PAYE people.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, the Mangan report was produced for the Minister for Social Protection.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to implement it in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  The issue the Deputy raises is a very real one and that is why the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has started the process with the tax credit for self-employed people.  Clearly, we cannot do all of these things without the resources to provide it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard free GP care, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has been very realistic here, both in terms of the numbers of doctors who are in training and the capacity to deliver the system.  The GP care will be for all under 18s.  He has pointed out the potential of overwhelming the service if we proceed on this particular model.  Were we to have nurses doing some of the work currently done by GPs, it would be a different matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200027#Z00600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1454434800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised to do it five years ago.

This involves 530 employees in Xtra-vision, 1,000 workers in Tesco who were told that they had contracts that could be ripped up, and workers who were contracted to work for the ESB as meter readers for the past 50 years.  That contract was sent out to tender and following that tendering process the contract was won and the workers who had a contract with the ESB were told that they can work for the companies that won the contract for half their pay.<\/p>  <p>  Seemingly, Xtra-vision had Xtra-vision-HMV and in 2013 it set up another company, Xtra-vision-Entertainment.  We saw that happen with Clerys and with other companies such as Connolly's Shoes, Paris Bakery and La Senza, where the workers had to lock themselves into a branch of the chain to get their proper payments.  Xtra-vision has done the same thing and left its workers high and dry.  The workers were told last November that they would get redundancy payments last week but on Tuesday we were told that the whole company is winding up and liquidators - some 166 -  were sent in to wind down the company.  Those workers were left with nothing; they were given no holiday pay and no redundancy.  They have mortgages to pay and families to feed and they have been given nothing.  The State in terms of the taxpayer will have to pick up this bill.  The 1,000 workers in Tesco have decent contracts and they are supported by the Mandate union.  Were it not for the fact that this union is strong in Tesco, those workers would be facing dire consequences.  They have been told they will be lose their overtime, morning pay allowance, shift allowance, etc.  <\/p>  <p>  John Douglas from Mandate, who appeared before an Oireachtas committee in 2013, said that unless directors are held responsible for what they do in regard to workers' rights, this will continue.  We have seen that it has continued.  What will the Minister do about directors who come into the country, set up shelf companies and use them to strip the assets of the company and then tell the workers they are not entitled to anything?  The collective bargaining legislation is not strong enough when it comes to defending workers' rights.  We on this side of the House called for such legislation to provide that unions should have a right of access to their  members.  We have been told by the workers that on notice boards in Tesco the notices from the union have been taken down  and that the union can only talk to its members in the car parks.<\/p>  <p>  This has to stop.  It is a shame that this Government has done nothing about this over the past five years when there were plenty of opportunities to do so.  We have seen too much of that happening, and it is still going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200029#BB01400","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1454436000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>It must be said that any situation where people are losing their job is something that is not welcome.

We all know that patterns of usage in the video rental area have changed dramatically, and this company has gone into liquidation as has happened.  It has the protection of the State and I can assure the Deputy that we will make all the resources of the State available to support the people who have been displaced from their jobs.<\/p><p>In a situation such as this, where a redundancy is concerned, there is a body of Irish employment legislation where there are significant protections afforded to employees whose employers are insolvent in the event that the employer defaults on payments of wages and other entitlements.  These rights are mainly contained in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and the Redundancy Payments Act, which are administered by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.<\/p><p>The purpose of the insolvency payments regime, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of insolvency of their employer.  In situations such as Xtra-vision, where a liquidator has been appointed, in the event that the employer is unable to pay the employees their statutory redundancy and other entitlements, a claim may be made on the Department of Social Protection.  <\/p><p>In the first instance the staff of Xtra-vision who have lost their jobs as a result of the closure should contact the liquidator to ensure they receive their statutory redundancy and wage-related payments.  The person legally appointed to wind up the company certifies the employees' redundancy and insolvency claims from the records available and sends the claims to the redundancy payments section of the Department of Social Protection.  The Workplace Relations Commission customer service and information unit was made available to provide information to the concerned staff.<\/p><p>As regards the position in Tesco, it should be noted that the terms of a contract are a matter for agreement between the parties to the contract.  Section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 sets out what terms in an employment contract must be put in writing.  Section 5 of the Act further provides that when a change is made or occurs in any part of the contract furnished by an employer, the employer shall notify the employee in writing of the nature and date of the change as soon as may be.  It is our understanding that Tesco is engaging with trade unions about proposed changes to the contracts in question, including the issue of compensation for affected employees.  The State's industrial relations machinery is available to assist, if required.<\/p><p>Anyone with concerns regarding employment rights can contact the Workplace Relations Commission customer service and information unit, which provides information on employment equality and industrial relations legislation.

He made a point about sympathy.  Workers do not want tea and sympathy, they want their jobs.  They want to be able to pay their mortgages.  They want to be able to pay for food to be put on the table over the coming weeks.  Xtra-vision gave no prior notice except to a small group of workers and it then reneged on that deal last Tuesday.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a young woman who has already had a mortgage payment taken from her wages.  She got paid for the work she did the week before last.  She worked three days last week and did not get paid for them, is owed holiday pay and expected a redundancy payment from Xtra-vision.  This company has set up a shelf company to allow it to renege on its responsibilities to its workers.  That is happening all the time, and this Government has done nothing to protect those workers from that activity.  These are rogue employers who, like Clerys, set up other shelf companies and then tell their workers that they have no rights and that they should apply for statutory redundancy.<\/p><p>I would like to know how much the insolvency fund has paid out in the past five years to workers who have been subjected to these conditions by their bosses.<\/p> <p> The Minister made a point about legislation.  The fact is that the collective bargaining legislation is not and was never going to be strong enough to take on rogue employers.  Tesco is a profitable multinational company.  Last week it called workers in and told them it would change their contracts.  Only because there is a strong union involved, namely, Mandate, will the workers be protected in any way.  However, they must go through a process.  If the union had not been there, I have no doubt those workers would have been left high and dry.  The Government has not lived up to its responsibility to bring in much stronger collective bargaining.  As John Douglas stated when the appeared before the relevant Oireachtas committee, directors who do such things should be barred from being directors of other companies in the future.  The situation will continue unless the new Government, which I hope will be a progressive Government of the left, is serious about tackling such issues.

We will have balanced employment protection and a balanced enterprise policy to grow our base and to grow opportunities for people so that they can put their lives back on track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200030#CC01100","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1454436600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>The next Topical Issue is in the names of Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.

I do not think the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, would deny that.  It is symptomatic of a broader malaise within the organisation.  Someone must be held to account.  A few investigations were carried out into this matter but they were either in-house or involved former members of the HSE who had gone into the private sector.

I am very pleased that the Ministers have decided to have a commission of investigation.  From the very beginning we believed that two things were necessary: first, that those responsible for this injustice would be held to account; and, second, that the issues would be publicly and independently aired.  That is an absolute necessity given the litany of inquiries which have taken place on the issue, which did not deliver anything.  Deputy Wallace is correct.  Rather than trying to address matters, the position adopted by the HSE, which is still in evidence today, was to shore up, lawyer-up and cover up and be incredibly economical with the truth.  That is what it smacks of to me.<\/p>  <p>  Grace remaining in the foster home for 13 years after the initial allegations of abuse were investigated is horrifically unique.  It is a fact that the information was in the hands of the HSE.  In 1996 a decision was made by the social workers on the ground to remove that young woman.  That is a fact which is backed up.  We know that subsequently the foster father contacted the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and petitioned to have what he called his \"beloved daughter\" kept with the family.  We do not know what happened after that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, informed us that the Minister for Health at that time, Deputy Noonan, and Minister of State, were not in any way responsible for that situation but the fact is that a documented case conference decision to remove that young woman from the foster home before August was subsequently reversed in October 1996 and the young woman, Grace, remained there up until 2009.  People need to know who made that decision and who will pay the price for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200030#CC02000","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1454436600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I know we are very restricted when it comes to the time allocated for the Topical Issue debate but I genuinely thank the two Deputies opposite for raising the issue as it is something that has preoccupied me for quite a considerable time.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the allegations of abuse in a foster home in the south east which are a matter of grave concern to me and to the Government.  Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  Our aim must always be to ensure that people maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.  They and their families trust us to care for them with kindness, compassion and respect.  While it is clear that real issues have been raised about the protection of vulnerable people in the south east, it has also been very difficult to establish the facts with certainty.  The matters relating to the south east were raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in 2015 in the context of the procurement process for reports into these matters and the extended period of time during which it has not been possible to publish them.<\/p><p>In response to the concerns raised and the ongoing delay in publishing reports commissioned by the HSE, I appointed Conor Dignam, SC, to undertake a review into these matters, taking account of the ongoing Garda investigation.  This review remains in train and Mr. Dignam will report back at the end of April.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the person at the centre of the Conal Devine inquiry, who we are now calling Grace, was removed from the foster family in 2009.  I understand that Grace is in full-time residential care with a voluntary service provider.  Matters are complicated by the fact that there is an ongoing Garda investigation and the HSE has been precluded from publishing the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports into the matter pending completion of that investigation.  While this may be frustrating, it is important that we do not prejudge the outcome.  Instead, we must remain focused on the questions that, in my opinion, remain unanswered.<\/p> <p> In view of the seriousness of the issues raised and the need to establish the facts, the Government has today approved the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation.  This is subject to the agreement of terms of reference and the approval of the Oireachtas.  I am in no doubt that the work undertaken by Mr. Dignam, SC, will make a key contribution to informing the drafting of the terms of reference for a commission of investigation.  Additional resources have been allocated to Mr. Dignam to allow him to accelerate the completion of his report.  Both the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I have requested copies of the Devine report and the Resilience Ireland report from the HSE under section 40C of the Health Act 2004.  This is an important development as we believe direct access to these reports will assist our understanding of the relevant facts surrounding these disturbing allegations.  It will also assist in bringing forward detailed proposals for the establishment of the commission of investigation.  I hope that early in the life of the new D&aacute;il, we will approve the establishment of the statutory commission of investigation and that it will also be approved by our colleagues in the Seanad.

One of the whistleblowers at the centre of this case has made the point that, sadly, it is not the only such case.  In his opinion, it represents dozens of others in the same region over a 20 to 30 year time span.  It is fair to say there is a systemic problem in the HSE.  It is very much the old attitude that when the church or State is threatened, the response is to say nothing, admit nothing, call in the lawyers and see what happens.  That mentality has traditionally done untold damage to citizens and vulnerable people in Ireland.  It is not good enough for service users.  It costs the State a huge amount of money later on, not only in the emotional damage to citizens but in the financial cost to the taxpayer.  The <i>modus operandi<\/i>appears to be that when a mistake is made, even if it is innocent, it is not investigated properly.  The response is that the HSE investigates itself and the people who are doing the investigating are former HSE staff under new guises of Tusla or one of the other independent companies that operate in this area.  It is really the HSE investigating itself.  That is why we have had the problem and that is why people have remained there.  Some people who are currently employed by the HSE are responsible for that and have to be dealt with.

The terms of reference of the commission of investigation will be crucial.  As far as I can see - I may be wrong - Conor Dignam's report and the two reports that have already been concluded should feed into the terms of reference.  It is essential that there is a political input because, as politicians, we are responsible to every citizen in the country, not only to those who go out and elect us.  We have equal responsibility to those who do not.

When this Government came to office, we set out to undo the damage and heal some of the hurt inflicted on the most vulnerable in our society.  One of those groups was the Magdalene women, the unseen launderers of our country's stains and secrets.  We issued a State apology to those women and established a restorative justice scheme in June 2013.  When I met them in London, they told me about the difference that apology made to their lives and the changes the restorative aspect is making.  There have been 804 applications to the scheme, with &euro;23 million paid out to date.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, we set up the statutory commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters.  We need to know, and will find out, what happened to these women and their babies between 1922 and 1998.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the Government established the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme to provide an alternative, non-adversarial option for the women affected.  There were 578 applications resulting in &euro;23 million in allocations at the end of 2015.<\/p>  <p>  If Ireland was declared by Yeats to be \"no country for old men\", the legacy issues I have just mentioned suggest it was positively treacherous and at times omnipotent when it came to our girls and women.  Immediately when we came to office, we began to look at these issues and started by focusing our attention on our children, which coincided with the Cloyne report on sexual violence inflicted on children in the Cloyne diocese.  I was anxious that the trauma inflicted on these children would be addressed and that we would make it clear as a country that the Constitution and our code of law were paramount and nothing else.  For the first time, we set about creating a full Cabinet ministry for children and youth affairs.  We established the Child and Family Agency with a regime of strict governance and stricter accountability for child and family services.  Under new national standards for the protection and welfare of children, front line services for children and families became subject to independent HIQA inspection for the first time.<\/p><p> The new Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 includes stronger sanctions aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation, child abuse material and online grooming.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes it an offence to withhold information on serious offences committed against a child or against a vulnerable adult and with the Children First Act, the Government gave children their voice.  It recognised them as individuals in their own right under the Constitution for the first time and because it did, the best interests of the child now are paramount in every decision taken by a public body in matters related to children.  Putting children first was a long time coming but at last it is here.  In respect of disability, HIQA, has carried out 1,370 inspections of residential settings for adults and children with disabilities since regulations came into effect in 2014.<\/p> <p> I believe I can speak for everyone in the House and many outside it when I state words do not exist to describe adequately the depth and volume of revulsion we feel about the allegations of abuse and failures of which we have heard.  I believe equally that the agreement in principle of a statutory commission of inquiry is the right way to address the enormity of the depravity that has been uncovered.  I acknowledge these are allegations but I believe the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government is the right way to proceed.  Grace, because of her condition, was silent but as I stated earlier, by her treatment and her abandonment she was silenced.  Those who left her to her fate pressed the mute button on her young life and on an appalling experience.  Above all, the mute button was pressed on her dignity, her humanity, her civil and human rights and on her innate worth as an innocent, precious fragile life on this earth.<\/p> <p> The question is: in ticking its boxes, was the system blind and deaf?  Did the system possess so little awareness and so little accountability that it could become a stone to Grace, a non-verbal person, to her abject experience or to her desperate need?  I expect the commission of investigation will answer these questions and will get the answers the people need.  It is critical that it should so do in finding and re-establishing our co-ordinates as a people and as a functioning, moral and responsible society.  I hope the drafting of the terms of reference for this commission will have a sound basis in the scoping exercise of the senior counsel, Mr. Dignam, that currently is under way and to which the Government has given additional resources and that the two reports, namely, the Devine report and the Resilience Ireland report, also will provide the basis on which an accurate and precise set of terms of reference can be put in place.  This should not interfere with the ongoing independent Garda inquiry.  The Ryan report into institutional abuse is a precedent in this regard, whereby a commission of investigation can proceed in parallel with a Garda inquiry and it remains for the next Administration to approve these terms of reference, to approve a sole member to deal with the commission of investigation and to proceed.<\/p> <p> I am sure the hearts of the many excellent foster parents in Ireland are breaking when they hear all these allegations.  They love the children who come to them as though they were their own.  I believe there is a resonance here that the present Government should concern itself with these matters as it comes to the close of its term because they are matters of doing not what is correct but of doing, as I stated here on my first day as Taoiseach, what is right.  The Government will seek with this commission to do what is right by Grace and all the young people and adults about whom allegations of maltreatment have been levied.  I believe it is the best, most powerful and thorough way to treat them with the respect and kindness of which their experience in their lives in care were so devoid.  This is a highly sensitive case and many allegations have been made.  It is right and proper that a structured, precise focused commission of investigation should be able to get at the truth for everybody in order that a similar event to this particular issue will not occur in future.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to say these few words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200031#DD00600","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454437800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I must state that on reading the reports in the media in recent days and weeks on this case, I felt a sense of dread, worry and, to be frank,<i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>about yet another story that appears to have its origins in the early 1980s and which went on for a considerable time.  This has been one of the motifs of the last five years of this Oireachtas, namely, all the different stories of the hidden Ireland that have come to view, from the women who were in Magdalen laundries to the children who were in institutions and to those children who died in institutions and the information Members heard about Tuam.  Members are aware that from the 19th century onwards, Ireland was a place with many hidden histories and a lot of institutional care.  While some people received very good institutional care, as has been stated, nonetheless what really separates people in institutional care from other people is they do not have parents to whom they go home at night.  Regardless of whether such care is in a school, an institution, a hospital or a home, they do not have parents to whom to go home at night and to complain if something bad and wrong has happened to them.<\/p><p>As for this case, I understand the communication capacity of the woman who has been named as Grace is limited and therefore she was not really in a position to communicate what may have been happening to her.  Consequently, it is important that the Government reached the decision to provide for a commission of investigation.  It is known that the allegations have surfaced over some time and that, for instance, the Committee of Public Accounts has received a series of protected disclosures about the care of a particular individual who lived in that foster home from the age of 11 for a period of approximately 20 years.  It also is known that approximately 21 years ago or after 1995, no more people were admitted to this particular home through the health services.  This morning, the Cabinet received a briefing from both the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>However, the point I wish to make is the extent to which people have been fostered or have been in institutions and in care in Ireland probably is far wider than the public understands and for anybody who has been in care, these revelations are extremely disturbing.  I am very friendly with a number of foster parents, including foster parents who particularly look after children with significant disabilities and who give a huge amount of care, attention and love.  I can only imagine these revelations are extremely distressing for them to hear.  As somebody who was both in care and foster care until the age of two and a half, I must state that for anybody who was in care - and in the context of the history of the past 50 or 60 years in Ireland, this relates to significant numbers of people - it is important this issue not be made into a political football.  This is about people's lives, that is, it is about the quality of their lives, about their dignity and about respect for those people.<\/p><p>It is important that we define a pathway to the truth, which will enable us to find out what happened, in this and related cases, to people who were in this home.  A significant number of people stayed in the home, in some cases on a permanent basis and, in others, on a temporary basis, for respite care.<br\/><br\/>As the Taoiseach said, over the lifetime of the Government, we have done a number of significant things in respect of children.  At the outset, the Government made a decision to set up a specific Department with responsibility for children and an agency, Tusla, to deal specifically with the care of children requiring different supports, with the oversight of children in different scenarios and with parents or foster parents who require various supports.  We also had a referendum of the people to emphasise the significant position of children in this society and there have been a number of significant legal developments to underpin the referendum that the people passed some time ago.<br\/><br\/>I refer back to Grace's case.  I heard the interview with the chief executive officer of Barnardos, Mr. Fergus Finlay, in the media about the whistleblower's decision to name this woman, Grace.  It was a good thing to do in order to personalise the case.  It means we can see an individual who may be like somebody we know or for whom we care.  The story becomes personal rather than being subject to the dry language in which cases are often addressed by people in the legal profession or, indeed, social workers.  The Government has passed groundbreaking legislation in respect of whistleblowers supported by the parties opposite.  I remind Deputies that we are in a position to begin to find out the story of what happened in this home as a result.<br\/><br\/>I commend my colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on having the courage to ensure we will get to the truth of this.  It will probably take a significant period because, first, Mr. Dignam, SC, must finish his work.  We have also been advised of two existing reports while a Garda inquiry is ongoing and has not concluded.  There are a great number of areas around which we have some information but the information is not necessarily complete or conclusive.  Yesterday, I met the Taoiseach to discuss the recommendation by the Minister of State for a commission of inquiry into this matter.  The proposal in this regard was strongly supported by the Minister for Health.  It will take some time and it will be for the next D&aacute;il to decide on the detailed terms of reference but the work commissioned some time ago by the Minister of State and the work being done by Mr. Dignam will lead to important information about what the detailed terms of reference of this inquiry should be.<br\/><br\/>We have a history in this country, unfortunately, of political violence, we have a history of sexual abuse and we have a history of institutions in which there have been both violence and sexual abuse.  I felt a terrible sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>as I read about some of the elements of this case which have come into the public domain.  I welcome the fact that Mr. O'Brien of the HSE appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts earlier and what he said can be subject to further examination and consideration in resolving what is, undoubtedly, yet another element in the story of hidden Ireland.  The D&aacute;il, particularly in the past five years, has played an important role in setting this story out for people in order that we understand our society and history better and move towards making Ireland a better place for everybody but, in particular, for people who are vulnerable or who have been abused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200032#EE00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454438400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>This case is harrowing and shocks people to the core, particularly given the fact that such a young child was left in a vulnerable position for such a prolonged period between 1996 and 2009.  She was not in a position to speak or to defend herself and the whistleblower is clear that the most appalling acts of abuse were perpetrated in this case.  We have a dark history in respect of child abuse in this country.  We have had numerous inquiries on many fronts that have sought to get to the truth of different incidents and systemic abuses against children in different settings such as institutions, the church and many others.  In this case, we are examining summer respite services.  Apparently, in this foster home, a family allegedly provided a service during the summer offering two to three weeks respite for the families and children concerned.  Up to 47 individuals availed of that service over a period.  Grace was there for a prolonged period.  The question screaming out for answer is: why was she left in that position for so long?  Given the then health board had decided in 1996 that there was enough concern not to recognise that this service should be availed of by its clients and their families, and given no new placements were made, why were that child and another, Ann, left there for so long, right up to the present day?

Given our experience of the Siteserv-IBRC investigation and the issues raised by the judge in terms of his sense of the limitations of that model and given a Garda inquiry is under way into reckless endangerment by health service officials in this case, I am still not clear about the capacity of an inquiry to conduct its work in parallel with the Garda inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  During Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach said it might be the case that the conclusions of a commission of investigation could not be published prior to the conclusion of the Garda investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200033#FF00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1454438400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200033#FF00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1454439000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We need to be very straight regarding what exactly is the position.  Is it the case that the outcome of this commission of investigation cannot be published until the Garda inquiry is concluded?  Is it also the case that witnesses may not co-operate with the commission of investigation for fear of prejudicing matters and so on?  Is that a concern?  The terms of reference can be agreed.  We know that from the issue relating to the IBRC and Siteserv.  The terms of reference can often be an issue of contention but not the core issue.  The core issue is legal competence and the capacity to have the comprehensive inquiry that is required.  There was an appalling series of events and a bungled apology by the HSE but, to a certain extent, that is not the core issue.  In one sense, the core issue is the scale and horrific nature of the abuse that was perpetrated on the young, defenceless children involved.  That seems not to have been brought out by either the criminal justice system or, for whatever reason, there might have been genuine obstacles in the way of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in terms of bringing prosecutions.  I am realist in that sense but, nonetheless, the whistleblowers are clear that appalling abuse was committed.  The rest of us are saying that.  I am simply saying that files went to the DPP.  Essentially, people were sufficiently concerned about these matters to ensure that no new placements were made.  They had real concerns and saw to it that placements ceased.<\/p>  <p>  Grace was left in that facility far longer than any person would have liked, either then, apparently, or subsequently.  It seems to me that the inquiry must be fairly comprehensive and perhaps - I am just making a point here - a stronger type of inquiry is needed to deal with those issues.  From what I am told and from I have read, there will be no prosecutions.  I am proceeding on the basis of what I am reading.  I watched the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts this morning and observed the toing and froing between its members and the HSE officials.  In respect of that whole period in the 1990s and later on, there is a lack of clarity in terms of the abuse allegations and what happened in respect of them.  Why did prosecutions not materialise?  It is clear that there were concerns.  The house in question ceased to be used as a recognised fostering facility for summer respite services by the health board at the time yet people still remained in it.  Then there was the phenomenon of families being referred to this home on a private basis as well.  Watching the Committee of Public Accounts there seems - if I am correct in my assessment - to have been this tortuous engagement between the HSE officials and the foster parents about ceasing that activity in respect of Ann.  She is the second person who was in the home up to 2013.  There is a question in that regard.  I ask the Taoiseach to share the legal advice with people on that issue.  We had all of this with the IBRC and it continued for months and months until, lo and behold, at the 11th hour we learned everything had been for naught because the judge could not continue with the investigation.  We do not want to go down that particular route again. <\/p>  <p>  I commend the whistleblowers.  In the Neary case and many others, whistleblowers spoke out and focused concentration on the issues.  In this instance, the matter has come to light through the Committee of Public Accounts.  Whistleblowing, fundamentally, is about culture in any organisation in the sense that people have the freedom to come forward and say what they have to say in a protected environment whereby they will not be penalised subsequently for saying what they have to say.  We know from experience in other cases that it can take some time for the whistleblower to be heard and for the impact of what they are saying to be felt.<\/p>  <p>  The other point I would make is that there are 47 children involved.  The Resilience Ireland report involves a review of the cases of those 47 children.  The HSE says it cannot publish the Resilience Ireland report.  I ask the Taoiseach to revisit that matter and to consider what the State can do in respect of the 47 families who had children placed in the foster home in question during the relevant period.  The Devine report, which deals specifically with the case of Grace, was commissioned in 2010 and was concluded in 2012.  Two years later, the Resilience Ireland report was commissioned.  That report examined at the other 46 cases, which was the obvious thing to do.  What proactive action is the Government proposing to take in respect of engagement with the families to which I refer?  Are counselling services required?  Is redress required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200034#GG00100","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1454439000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200034#GG00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1454439000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I ask the Taoiseach that, painful as it might prove to be, a proactive programme of engagement be entered into with those families.

It is with a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>and deep sadness that I speak on this harrowing issue.  The detail of the abuse, in so far as we know it, suffered by Grace makes for distressing and disturbing reading and her treatment and the other elements of this dreadful episode in the life of this citizen warrants the most thorough Garda investigation.  The DPP also has serious questions to answer about how it handled the allegations of abuse at the foster home in question.  The HSE, the Oireachtas and successive Governments must also questions to answer about the persistent failures of child protection systems over the decades.<\/p><p>I commend the whistleblower but we must acknowledge that there is no culture, at this time, to encourage people to blow the whistle or to tell their stories.  In fact, the contrary appears to be the case.  As an 11 year old child, Grace, who has severe intellectual disabilities and is non-verbal, was placed in the foster home in 1989 and was only removed 20 years later.  Her abuser shamefully and outrageously exploited her disability.  We may never know the full extent of the abuse but it seems that the foster care was never properly assessed.  It appears that the serious allegations of abuse and neglect were ignored.  Five files arising from concerns about abuse were sent to the DPP since 1990.  There were no prosecutions.  The whistleblower said he brought Grace to hospital twice because of the extent of her injuries.  Despite this, he claims he could not persuade the HSE to take the legal steps needed to end the placement.  Grace was left in this foster home for 13 years after new HSE placements had been stopped.<\/p><p>The whistleblower asserts &quot;that a wide range of southern eastern health boards and HSE employees, including senior managers, had known about this case since the 1990s but no one was prepared to terminate the foster place and move the young woman to a safe accommodation.&quot;  This story is the stuff of nightmares.  It is a litany of failure and cover up.  If the whistleblower had not gone to the Committee of Public Accounts and if a row had not erupted because of the botched nature of the apology, this tragic account of abuse of a young woman might have remained largely hidden behind unpublished reports.  It was only when it was faced with public outrage that the Government finally acts and establishes a commission of investigation.  I welcome this decision but I am concerned that it is being dealt with in the way that it is.<\/p><p>Some 47 highly vulnerable children and young adults were placed in this foster home.  I have no doubt that their families are deeply traumatised by this unfolding story and wondering about their loved ones.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the terms of reference of the commission of investigation are discussed with opposition spokespersons to ensure that it is comprehensive and secures the widest possible support in this D&aacute;il.  This is particularly important given that there has been a succession of damning reports about the treatment of women and children by the institutions of this State over many decades.  Currently, one in five foster carers do not have a social worker.  This is actually in breach of the regulations.  How can the State ensure there are no other Graces in the foster care system if there are not the social workers available to provide the necessary level of scrutiny.  This morning the chairperson of the Irish Association of Social Workers, Donal O'Malley, said he is not confident that there are sufficient safeguards in place to prevent another case like Grace happening again.<\/p><p>Last month, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in revealed there are 5,585 children waiting more than one month to be allocated a social worker and of these, 1,087 are classified as high risk.  All of this represents a failure on the part of Government to fulfil its responsibilities and of the Members of the Oireachtas to fulfil our responsibilities.  The Government is now in its last hours.  What is certain is that the next Government faces a mighty challenge to right the mistakes that have left vulnerable people in the awful situation they were placed in and to ensure vulnerable women and children in particular are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200034#GG00500","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454439600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The recent abuse allegations surrounding a foster home in the south-east and the most horrendous treatment endured by an intellectually disabled young woman, whom we have come to know as Grace, depicts another example of the system that has failed to protect, respect and cherish those who are most vulnerable in our society.  It has been revealed that Grace was subjected to the most horrendous abuse by her foster parent or parents and was left in this home for more than 13 years after it became the subject of abuse allegations.<\/p>  <p>  Two whistleblowers in the HSE came forward in 2009 and brought to light the horrendous abuse endured by Grace at the hands of her foster parent or parents.  On the back of these allegations, the Conal Devine report was completed in 2012 but it has still not seen the light of day.  A second report into 46 other cases in the foster home was completed in 2015 and that too has not been published.  This blanket of secrecy depicts perfectly in my mind how badly the HSE dealt with these most shocking of allegations.  In this particular case, the actions or lack thereof by the HSE has been disgraceful.  It defies belief that an attempt was made to claim that an apology had been issued to Grace and that the HSE then had to admit last Saturday that no official apology had been issued to her.  Furthermore, this case raises wider questions regarding the way social services and the criminal justice system deal with abuse allegations against vulnerable people.  Grace's disability was used as a means to prevent legal action.  She and her carers were told that her allegations could not be prosecuted because she would not make a good witness due to her inability to speak.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this is not the first time that such an appalling case of abuse of the most vulnerable in society has come to light and I have no doubt it will not be the last.  A range of other settings have been exposed for malpractice over recent years.  Back in 2014, we had the disturbing revelations of abuse in &Aacute;ras Attracta residential centre in County Mayo.  The critical question now is how we ensure that a situation like this is not taking place as we speak and that such outrageous abuse and oversight neglect is not to occur time and again into the future.  I am in no doubt that the critical matter now is not just the address of the individual care home setting and the tragedy of Grace's abuse and health board and HSE neglect, tantamount to her having been written off by officialdom as a non-person, but that there is a need for a root and branch re-examination of the level of training, management and oversight right across the HSE and all care settings.  That is what is required.  Anyone who knows of other cases and has kept quiet until now or who has behaved badly themselves towards these people, the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters, I say to them to go now, to leave, as they are not suitable people to hold such positions of trust.<\/p>  <p>  That said, as I have a non-verbal, intellectually disabled brother, I know at first hand the great work that so many employed in these settings perform.  This drip, drip expos&eacute; of dreadful behaviour by some must also deeply hurt those who are true carers in these settings - people deserving of respect and support.  I find it totally unacceptable that, once again, our voiceless in care have depended on whistleblowers to shine a light on the treatment they have endured.<\/p>  <p>  We are, of course, on the cusp of an election but it is still essential that we all - I mean all of us, together - ensure that the next Government, irrespective of its make-up, takes real and immediate steps to ensure this most wicked behaviour, that presents time after time in one incident after another, is substantively addressed, once and for all.  For those who cannot speak for themselves, such substandard care must be rooted out, and fast.  We must take the required steps to help ensure that the highest standards are understood in the first instance and implemented by those we trust to look after those defenceless loved ones from our respective families.  We must examine care settings right across the board and instil through retraining and up-training the highest standards in management and oversight in every care setting in the land.  Our voiceless must never again have to depend on whistleblowers.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the plans for a commission of inquiry into these abuse allegations but I cannot help feel that, for the Graces of our land, this is coming too late; they have had to endure too much.  What we need to ensure is that there are no more like Grace and those who we have perhaps yet to identify and who have suffered equally grievously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200035#HH00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1454439600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Deputies Clare Daly and Finian McGrath are sharing time.

This is not going to go away.  The first point I would make is that what is in the public domain is only the tip of the iceberg on this issue.  There are a number of aspects in regard to the Grace case which are unique and particularly horrific but what is not unique is the approach taken by the HSE in its failure to deal with it.  In fact, that is something that is all too familiar.<\/p>  <p>  The only conclusion one can draw from the manner in which this has been addressed is that it is now a systemic problem inside the HSE, at best characterised as incompetence, at worst as recklessness and deliberate cover-up.  I do not make those points lightly.  We know the organisations charged with investigating and examining some of these allegations were connected to some of the officialdom and upper management inside the HSE itself.  We know the South Eastern Health Board had a long-standing knowledge of the allegations at the heart of this case for a period of decades.  We know that, in the initial investigation, it was the social workers who were blamed for the problems - scapegoated, in fact - when, in reality, the role of a social worker is a little like the relationship of a garda to the DPP, in that a garda makes recommendations and the DPP decides whether to act.  A social worker makes a report and the line manager decides what happens next - that is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  There are a couple of facts we need to know more about.  It is a fact there was a decision in 1996 to remove Grace from the foster home.  It was based on a proper case study and supported documentation as to the rationale of the abuse and the reason that young woman should be removed - decision taken.  We know that on 9 August, the foster father contacted the Department of Health and begged for his foster daughter to remain in his care.  We know the Minister for Health at that time made inquiries as to why the decision to remove her had been made.  We know that subsequently in September, the file shows, \"We need to discuss this case\", but the decision was overturned for legal reasons.  No legal information was quantified and there was no proper case study as to the rationale for that decision.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know who is responsible and I am not blaming anybody but somebody made that decision and somebody has to be held accountable.  Rather than deal with that, the approach taken by the health board was to minimise and to lawyer up, the same approach I heard at the Committee of Public Accounts today.  Again, the impression was given today that the HSE was on top of it, was dealing with this, kind of found out in 2010 and moved straight away.  That is not true.  The HSE knew about it well before then.  It was reignited when a new social worker arrived in 2007.<\/p><p>Even in regard to the &quot;Ann&quot; case, we know that in 2010 the HSE contacted the family of that woman and advised it not to have a care arrangement with that foster home, but did not give the reasons.  We know Resilience Ireland, appointed by the HSE, visited that family and told it not to have anything to do with the foster home, but did not give the family the reasons for that advice.  That is in clear breach of all protocol in these situations.  The HSE policy requires full disclosure of the reason for a review.  Where there is sensitive information - the Barr judgment lays down the legal responsibility for this - and if somebody is in danger, there is an obligation, even if they are only allegations, to make those allegations known, as long as one notifies the person against whom the allegations were made.  That was not done.  The family was not given the reasons. <br\/><br\/>Up to 2015, the second person, Ann, was in contact with that foster home because of the breach in policy of the HSE.  That failure led to further abuse, not just of Grace but of Ann and, I have no doubt, of the other people who engaged with that service.  The accountability for this mismanagement goes right to the top of the HSE, to the people at the upper echelons.  I do not know if a commission of investigation is the best way to deal with this, but I believe it needs to be out in the open.  We, or whoever is back here after the election, will need to discuss the terms for a commission, but part of those terms must be about aftercare, about strengthening the obligations of the State to look after children when they reach the age of majority and, in particular, advocacy for vulnerable adults and no interference with or watering down of guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>systems and so on.  This is urgent and I hope it is the first job on the plate of whatever Government is elected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200035#HH00400","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454440200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>It is with great sadness and shock that I speak on this urgent debate on the abuse of young Grace in foster care in the care of the State.  I am also deeply hurt and angry as a parent of a daughter with an intellectual disability when I see how this person suffered, but nobody acted.  She spent 13 years in a home - abused, tortured and exploited.  That poor young girl - 13 years of sheer hell and 13 years of failings and neglect.  I thought this issue was a thing of the past and that we had this debate in the D&aacute;il more than a year ago.<\/p>  <p>  Let us focus today on the victim and on the need to support her and let us forget for a while all this talk about a commission of inquiry.  A person, a young woman, was savagely assaulted and those guilty or involved in any negligence or cover-up should be prosecuted.  This is a policing and Garda matter.  Those responsible must take responsibility for their actions and their incompetence.  We should not have to wait for another two years for a commission of inquiry, which could end up in dodgy territory or in legal complications that cost the taxpayers millions of euro.  We need to take three basic steps.  First, those responsible must be held accountable and prosecuted.  Second, compensation and support should be provided for the young victim and her family.  Third, we must put in place adequate protection measures for all people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I warned about the dangers in this regard a number of years ago in the D&aacute;il when we were discussing other cases of child sexual abuse.  I warned that some of these abusers would come up with new ideas to infiltrate services where there are vulnerable children and young adults.  We need to be very vigilant and to put in place adequate protections.  We have some excellent protections in place in our primary and secondary schools and in other areas, but people with intellectual disabilities are often forgotten about.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister is here to hear me mention another issue.  Families and parents of children and adults with intellectual disabilities are extremely traumatised and very hurt and sad.  This is the case all over Ireland as we speak tonight.  That said, we should never forget that we have wonderful foster parents in this country who do an amazing job.  I know many of those foster parents and they should not be labelled in any way in respect of this issue.  We have excellent foster care families who do a great job with children in care and children at risk and I use this opportunity to commend them.  However, we must be always vigilant.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue in respect of children and young adults with intellectual disabilities is that this is just one case, but only God knows how many cases are out there.  This leads me on to the issue of whistleblowers.  I commend them because they are patriots who have stood up against the system to shout and scream to protect our young vulnerable people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to deal with the issue of \"accountability\", a word that is often abused in public life.  We need accountability and need to get away from the broad debates on management and policy matters.  We need people in our services who are accountable and who provide transparency.  We need the right people in the right positions.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of these vulnerable individuals points to serious human rights abuses that amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.  I urge the Minister and the Government to be vigilant, although it is late at this late stage to say that.  We need to be vigilant to protect all our young people, particularly those with intellectual disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1454440200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the House about allegations of heinous and horrendous abuse in a foster and respite home in the south east and the subsequent alleged neglect and endangerment by the authorities which should have acted differently.  These issues are a matter of grave concern for me, the Government and, increasingly, the public as it has learned more about them in recent days and weeks.  It is important, however, not to forget that no matter how horrific, these remain allegations.  There have been Garda investigations, but there have been no prosecutions or convictions to date.  An inquiry is certainly needed and that is the reason the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I have recommended it to the Government.  However, we should not and cannot have the inquiry here on the floor of this House.  That is not our role.  Also, we should not come to conclusions or prescribe outcomes until we know all the facts.  Clearly, we do not know all the facts at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Every child or vulnerable adult who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  Our aim always must be to ensure people maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.  They and their families trust us to care for them with kindness, compassion and respect.<\/p>  <p>  While it is clear that grave issues have been raised about the protection of vulnerable people, children and adults, in the south east, it has been very difficult to establish the facts with certainty.  The matters relating to the allegations of abuse in the south east were raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in 2015, in the context of the procurement process for the Devine report and the Resilience Ireland report into these matters and the extended period of time during which it has not been possible to publish these reports.  In response to these concerns and the delays in publishing these reports, which may yet answer many of the questions currently unanswered, with my support the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch appointed Conor Dignam, Senior Counsel, to undertake a review into these matters, taking into account the ongoing Garda investigation. This review is ongoing and will report back at the end of April.  In many ways, it is scoping out the commission of investigation which will follow.<\/p>  <p>  I have received assurances from the HSE that the person at the centre of the Conal Devine inquiry, whom we are calling Grace, was removed from the foster family seven years ago, in 2009.  I understand that Grace is now in full-time residential care with a voluntary service provider and that she has been well cared for over the past seven years.<\/p>  <p>  These matters are complicated by the fact that they remain the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation, which has precluded the HSE from publishing the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports because of Garda concern that nothing should happen, be done or said that might jeopardise the potential Garda investigation.<\/p><p>Those in this House who are demanding accountability and for people to be held to account immediately should consider the possibility that they may be helping, with their words, those people to avoid accountability and prosecution.  I appeal to Members to bear that in mind in their comments.  Trials have been halted in the courts in this State because of comments by politicians in this House and people who should have been convicted were not as a result of utterances in the D&aacute;il.  I ask Members to bear that in mind in any contributions they make on the issue.  Privilege may protect the Deputies but it may put others at risk and allow certain people to evade their responsibilities.  It may be frustrating but it is very important that we do not prejudge the outcome.  Instead, we must maintain focus on the questions that remain unanswered and, in particular, why Grace, as we now call her, was left in that home for many years after the authorities determined it was unsafe to place other people there.  We still do not have a clear answer to that question.<\/p> <p> In view of the seriousness of the issues raised, conflicting accounts, the fact the various whistleblowers are not aligned, incomplete information and misinformation from the HSE and the unanswered questions, we need to establish the facts.  We are all agreed on that and so the Government has decided to establish a statutory commission of investigation.  This is subject to the agreement of terms of reference and approval of the Oireachtas.  I am in no doubt that the work under way by Mr. Conor Dignam, senior counsel, will make a key contribution in informing the drafting of the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.  Additional resources have been allocated to Mr. Dignam to allow him to accelerate the completion of his scoping report.<\/p> <p> Both the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I have requested copies of the Devine report and the Resilience Ireland report from the HSE under section 40C of the Health Act 2004.  This is an important development as we believe that direct access to these papers will assist our understanding of the relevant facts surrounding these disturbing allegations.  The HSE has assured the Department of Health that it has not waited for the publication of the Devine report to act on its recommendations and that it has put in place a number of changes to take account of the service and management deficiencies identified.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I will verify that this is the case in the coming days.<\/p> <p> The HSE has also assured me that work is well under way in implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures aimed at improving the quality of residential services for people with disabilities in the care of the State.  This six-step change programme includes implementing the national policy and procedures on safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse as well as the appointment of Ms Leigh Gath as the confidential recipient.  She will receive concerns of abuse, negligence, mistreatment or poor care practices in the HSE or HSE-funded services from patients, service users, families or other concerned individuals and staff.  If people wish to make a confidential disclosure to Ms Gath, the option is now available.  In addition, and at the request of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the HSE is establishing a national independent review panel with an independent chair and review team for disability services.  That is in the 2016 service plan and the review panel will focus on serious incidents that occur in disability services across the HSE and HSE-funded services.  It will review independently with a view to publication of its reports in order to ensure accountability and learning.  We have already moved away from the idea of tendering reports to private companies and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, took action on this some time ago to put in place a standing independent national review panel.  It will review issues like this independently and it is a pity that previous Governments did not do that.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that the Government is committed to the protection of vulnerable people with a disability in the care of the State.

I salute the dedication, commitment and, above all, the actions of the whistleblowers involved.  Without them, we would not have heard the details we heard over the past number of weeks and months in the discussions in the Committee of Public Accounts and in tonight's debate on a commission of inquiry being set up.  I take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge the work and commitment of Committee of Public Accounts, particularly the Deputies from the south-east, Deputies McGuinness and Deasy, in highlighting what can best be described as a distressing and an appalling story.  The Committee of Public Accounts has had many critics but as we have seen over the past number of weeks, it has done a significant job of work in its public service commitment.<\/p>  <p>  It is grim that this new story of sex abuse has arisen and a new inquiry is required.  It is appalling to hear about abuse against such a vulnerable person - a defenceless girl - who grew into womanhood in such a place.  It is very disturbing and the State, as well as those in whom responsibility for care was vested, should take responsibility yet again for the failures in the support systems.  Yet again the HSE has been left with a less than exemplary record and its response to the issue has made it worse.  It continued to make statements that contradicted previous statements.  The most dismal management in approaching the context of disclosure must come to an end.  The inability of the HSE to respond in a humane or sensitive manner to these matters is simply incredible.  There was a tardy apology from the HSE director general that did not reverse the trauma suffered by the victim and her family.  Despite allegations of sexual assaults being made by the former residents of the home, no action was taken.<\/p>  <p>  The events that played out over the week point to enormous dysfunction in the HSE and it appears there has been a lack of communication skills, humanity and compassion.  Officials from the HSE deliberately misled the Committee of Public Accounts, which is a source of very serious concern.  I accept that the Government needs to allow the senior counsel to conclude his work and that terms of reference in respect of the inquiry must be drawn up to protect the interests of the vulnerable.  Vindicating the rights of people with disability, particularly those in residential settings, must be a priority for everybody in the 32nd D&aacute;il.  We have failed for far too long to establish an understanding of human rights and citizenship in these institutions.  Yet again we are having another investigation and it is not clear if we will ever get to the bottom of it.<\/p>  <p>  A number of very serious allegations have been made by Deputy Daly and it is incumbent on the Government to respond to the two charges made by her in the course of today's debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200037#KK00200","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1454440800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I join with everybody who has spoken so far in this brief debate and express my horror and revulsion at the reports that have emerged in the past week or ten days of abuse and neglect in this particular home in the south east region.  I fully support and endorse the Government's decision to set up a statutory inquiry to ascertain the full facts and information surrounding what sounds like an horrific story.  I wish Mr. Dignam very well in his task of ongoing review.<\/p>  <p>  A number of factors make the information that has come into the public domain particularly appalling in this case.  I am 37 years old and thought, as I drove to Dublin today, that for all my adult life, effectively, there has been at a different times different stories of abuse and neglect.  We all hoped, I suppose, that the worst of those stories were over.<\/p><p>As we have ascertained, however, media sources indicate that may not be the case.  I am conscious that a Garda investigation is ongoing, and we all have a duty to be careful about what we say in this House.<br\/><br\/>While I am not a parent, I do have a nine-year-old nephew and godson who cannot speak.  I know that my brother, his wife and their family, including the extended family, invest so much love and attention in his care.  The thought that somebody who cannot verbalise what is happening could have been subjected to such neglect and abuse brings this set of facts to a whole different level.  In the case of a child with special needs of any description, the matter of trust is even more important than in the lives of other children.  Given the facts that have emerged in this case, that trust has been shattered in so many ways and at so many levels.  <br\/><br\/>It is incumbent on the State to ensure the full facts of this case emerge as soon as possible.  In that way, the special efforts of the many loving people who open their homes as foster parents, and who do such great - in many cases unrewarded - work for children, will not be tarnished by this shocking case that has emerged in recent days. There is a moral obligation on the HSE, which was effectively acting in <i>loco parentis<\/i>, to explain the error.  Error is too insignificant a word to describe the apparent oversight of this girl's existence, who we now call Grace.  She was in care, yet the system seems to have been oblivious to her very existence.  Those facts bring this situation to an appalling level, even in light of what has emerged in the past 25 years concerning other abuse cases. <br\/><br\/>I hope that Mr. Dignam will be soon in a position to give his initial report, and that shortly thereafter the Oireachtas will be able to establish a statutory inquiry so that we can get to the bottom of this appalling situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200037#KK00300","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454441400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo againn anocht, d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar scannal cos&uacute;il le scannail eile a chuaigh ar aghaidh sa t&iacute;r seo.  There is an air of, \"Can this have happened again in recent years?\", after so many similar cases in the past.  It is so reminiscent of our debates and discussions on the Magdalene Laundries, the mother and baby homes, and the abuse in residential institutions where young men, women and children were so disregarded and brutalised.  When we had those debates, there was a feeling that had happened in the past and could not recur, yet here we are discussing this matter tonight.  <\/p>  <p>  Language can sometimes fail to adequately describe how we feel or think about matters such as this.   We use words such as \"horrifying\", \"shocking\" or \"terrible\", but they do not convey the enormity of what we are told happened to these young people.  This is at a time when we supposedly know so much more and where safeguards are supposed to be in place.  We have policies on child care and child protection, as well as complaints procedures.  All of those measures, however, failed to protect these vulnerable 47 people, and especially those known as Grace and Ann.  <\/p>  <p>  It is therefore vitally important that the truth is established as to how such abuse could have continued for so long.  We are having a commission of investigation and a Garda report to establish the truth.  I wish to acknowledge the persistence of the whistleblower, who I believe is a social worker, who has tried for six years to bring to light this matter.  There has been a spectacular failure on somebody's part to address the issues.<\/p>  <p>  If persons fail children in whatever setting, and know about abuse, it should be a matter for dismissal - but not a dismissal that lands in court with the authorities being sued.  Alternatively, those concerned should have the honour - if they have any - to resign.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Irish Association of Social Workers referred to the rapid turnover of staff and the relative inexperience of those working with children at risk.  We know we do not have enough social workers and we can see that, in particular, concerning the provision of services for homeless people.  Families have been in touch with me who have been waiting for very long periods to have a social worker assigned to them.  Earlier today during questions to the Minister for Health, we were talking about cuts to intellectual disability services and a reduction in the number of trained intellectual disability nurses.  They are being replaced by agency staff who do not have experience in that area.<\/p>  <p>  The most important question is why children were left in the home when the allegation of abuse emerged.  I would like clarification on new graduates going into Tusla.  That agency finds it difficult to retain staff because they are moving on to less stressful positions.  I agree with what the Minister said earlier about establishing the facts, but I want to return to another abuse issue that I raised here at Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach.  It led to me meeting with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and it concerns abuse in swimming circles.  Some of the perpetrators were brought to justice but one known figure in swimming circles was not.  By whatever means, he left this country and was able to live a fine life in another jurisdiction, leaving a trail of heartache behind him for his abuse victims.  The facts were established and garda&iacute; were confident that this person would be brought to justice.  Garda&iacute; met one of the victims and assured her that due process would be followed, the person would be brought to court and she would see justice.  That would have been part of a healing process for her, which is so important for people who have been abused, but that did not happen because the DPP decided not to go ahead with the case.<\/p>  <p>  When Garda detectives called out to tell this victim that the case was not going ahead, she tried to commit suicide.  There have been other suicides of that person's victims since then because the person was not brought to justice, even though the facts were known.  I am sorry, but I do not have much faith in the DPP, given that Garda detectives were confident the case would go ahead.  I sincerely hope that does not happen in the current case.  I do not want to jeopardise any investigation of a criminal case, but I have grave doubts as to whether justice can be done for those who suffered.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to refer to the foster parents I met in my teaching days, who give exemplary care to children in their care.  They must be feeling particularly hurt today because there is a danger of tarring everybody with the same brush.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020200038#LL00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1454441400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who contributed to this debate, as well as those who referred to the matter before this debate.  As other colleagues have said, these are particularly harrowing allegations.  It is not often that everyone in the House is in agreement on an issue, and it is sad we find ourselves in agreement on how shocking and disturbing are these allegations.<\/p>  <p>  Every person who avails of our health services is entitled to the best and safest care, and even more so when that person is vulnerable.  Instead, we know that our health services failed Grace and other children and young people who were placed with this foster family at a time when they most needed our care and protection.<\/p>  <p>  I have been assured that Grace is now being fully cared for in full-time residential care by a voluntary service provider.  The HSE chief officer and her team in the south-east will continue to work collaboratively with the service provider, Grace and her advocates, to ensure the highest quality of service and support continues to be provided to her.<\/p><p>I strongly believe it is in the public interest that we establish the facts surrounding the care of Grace and other vulnerable people who were placed in this foster home but, more importantly, we owe it to those involved and their families who entrusted the health services with the safety and well-being of their loved ones.<\/p> <p> The work which I have commissioned from Mr. Conor Dignam SC has been already mentioned and additional resources have been approved to allow him to expedite his review, which I expect to be completed by the end of April.  We need to be precise and focused on the questions that remain unanswered and the work that is under way by Mr. Dignam will greatly inform the drafting of the terms of reference for a commission of investigation.  As I said previously, there must be some political input into the terms of reference.  Mr. Dignam has had access to the Devine report and the Resilience Ireland report in completing his review and I assure the House that I intend to read both reports as soon as I receive them from the HSE.  I expect that the reports may make difficult reading but they will greatly assist us in understanding the facts surrounding these shocking allegations.  I hope that they will be published in the future as everyone involved in our health services should be aware of the potential harm that can occur to vulnerable people in our care.<\/p> <p> As the Minister mentioned, in view of the seriousness of the issues raised and the need to establish the facts, the Government has today approved the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation and I welcome that decision.  The commission will provide a statutory mechanism to get to the bottom of these allegations.  I am confident that this is the best mechanism to achieve this.  I hope that early in the life of the new D&aacute;il, this House will approve the setting up of this statutory commission of investigation and that this will also be approved by colleagues in the Seanad.  That would be a powerful symbol of how seriously this House takes this appalling matter.  It is clear that there have been failures in protecting vulnerable people in our care.  For a number of reasons, it has been difficult to establish the facts with certainty.  This has been acknowledged and I am confident that through the commission of investigation, we can resolve this.  While this is very much in the public interest, it is also very much in the interest of those vulnerable people who are directly affected and their families.  <\/p> <p> I reiterate what the Minister said.  Listening to some, although not the majority, of the contributions, I have very serious worries that while we are protected, what is said in here could impact any outcomes outside the House.  This is why I deeply appreciate the fact the majority of people who spoke were very careful and conscious that our words are being listened to, not just by the public, which has an interest, but by those who may use those contributions to protect themselves.  This is hugely important.<\/p> <p> I also congratulate the whistleblowers.  I very much appreciate that sometimes it is not an easy task and involves making oneself more vulnerable within the system in which one works.  I also appreciate the many good people, who are in the majority, who provide care to vulnerable people.  I say to each and every one of these people that this is not a reflection on them but things did go wrong, there were lapses and we need to find out why and how they happened and how we can prevent them happening in the future.
