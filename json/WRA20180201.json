The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector.

It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services.\u00a0 Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student well-being.  The Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015) provide a Framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to new practices as appropriate.  They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social emotional learning.  The European wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice.  The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.\u00a0\u00a0 The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines highlight the vital role schools play in providing a protective environment for young people which can counter risk factors.  Additionally having a whole school approach which fosters important links with the wider school community, and agencies which support schools, is key to successful implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  They provide information for schools on the supports services that are currently available. Schools are advised to seek this support when\u00a0in developing the whole school approach. \u00a0It is important that this support is well coordinated and that schools are clear about the responsibilities of the support agencies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines advise that in the event of pupils presenting with mental health difficulties which are above and beyond the school's capacity and ability to support, school authorities should identify and access the referral pathways for the various primary and secondary healthcare services in their particular area. My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is available to advise schools on the matter. Referrals should, of course, be undertaken with Parental or Guardian consent and collaboration, except in an exceptional situation where there may be child protection issues.

Support to the school community in this regard is being provided from a number of sources within my Department including the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[4664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position with regard to the building of a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will probably be aware, the project to which he refers has been devolved for delivery to the local Education and Training Board (ETB).<\/p><p>Planning permission has been received for the project which is at detailed design stage.\u00a0 In this regard, the\u00a0Stage 2b submission was recently submitted to my Department for consideration.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department is\u00a0currently reviewing its\u00a0programme for capital expenditure in 2018 and 2019 and\u00a0timing of the progression of the\u00a0project\u00a0to the next stage will\u00a0be considered in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Administration","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[4688\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100044#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the transparency of the school selection process for the DEIS scheme will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The identification process for the DEIS Programme has adopted\u00a0a new scientific approach for\u00a0the selection of schools for inclusion in DEIS. \u00a0As you are aware, the identification of levels of disadvantage in schools is based on data provided by schools themselves, combined with publically available Small Area of Population Census data, as represented by the Pobal HP Index.

As the TAC is now the competent body for the management of appeals, I consider that it is appropriate that it be the primary source for appeals statistics.  However, there is one important piece of information that the TAC does not currently receive for those appeals made directly to it.  This is the value figure for the amount of tax that is outstanding or in dispute.  I have been advised by Revenue that it would have no difficulty in providing the TAC with this information.

This includes the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools and the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.  <\/p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.  <\/p><p>DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  <\/p><p>The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  <\/p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  <\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0have been\u00a0provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.  <\/p><p>Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  <\/p><p>Schools\u00a0therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools\u00a0now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  <\/p><p>The number of special education teachers allocated to mainstream schools has increased by 13% in the last two years, with 13,400 posts available for allocation in the current school year, compared to just over 11,800 posts allocated in the 2015\/16 school year.  <\/p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to over 1,300 with 169 new special classes for the 2017\/18 school year.  1,042 of the 1,300 special classes\u00a0are ASD special classes of which 149 are\u00a0newly established for this school year.  <\/p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.  The number of students attending special schools has increased by 150 on average each year over the last 4-5 years, increasing from 6,848 in 2011\/12 to 7,750 in 2016\/17, an increase of 13%.  <\/p><p>In the region of 34,000 students with special educational needs will have access to 14,120 SNA posts to the end of this school year, which is an increase of 33.5% over 2011, when 10,575 SNA posts were allocated.  Budget 2018 has provided for an additional 960 SNA posts for September 2018, which will bring the total number of SNA posts available to over 15,000.  <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class or special school placements can access such placements.  <\/p><p>Parents\/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places. The local SENO contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.  <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.  <\/p><p>The NCSE policy advice noted that ASD is a spectrum condition, so some students with ASD may require little support in school and are relatively independent in their learning, while others require significant levels of support.  <\/p><p>The NCSE Policy Advice also states that International Research findings suggest that most students with ASD should be considered for inclusion in mainstream education with their peers, where inclusion is well-planned and well-resourced.  <\/p><p>Decisions about placement should be based on individual needs and take into account a number of factors including parental wishes, availability of evidence-based treatments and well-trained staff and individual factors such as targets for intervention and management of behaviours.  <\/p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  <\/p><p>Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  <\/p><p>There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with ASD, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.  <\/p><p>The work of the Implementation Group for the policy advice, with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives is ongoing, in ensuring that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[5209\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which adequate school places exist or are being provided for children with autism or other special needs at primary and second levels throughout County Kildare in line with requirements as set out by school authorities and parents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>Ensuring that children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for this government.

These are based on national and international benchmarks, and will enhance our monitoring arrangements.  <\/p><p>In addition, I will also be publishing the 2017 End of Year Review. This shows the progress we made during 2017, with 86% of scheduled actions delivered.  <\/p><p>Cumulatively, the Action Plans and monitoring process will ensure we achieve the ambition of the Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Funding","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[5214\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100050#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the degree to which he remains confident that investment in education and the sciences at all levels will continue to be available in the future and having particular regard to the need for excellence in the face of growing competition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>I am committed to securing continuing investment in education and training in order to deliver on the actions set out in the Action Plan for Education ad to meet our ambition of making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.  <\/p>  <p>  During my time as Minister, the Government has allocated over &euro;1 billion additional funding to education and training over the past two Budgets.  The gross 2018 budget allocation for the Department of Education and Skills is &euro;10. 085 billion, the largest in the Department&rsquo;s history.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 alone provided for over 2,300 additional teaching and Special Needs Assistant posts in schools by the end of 2018.  It allowed for significant additional investment of over &euro;64 million to be made in higher and further education and training from the National Training Fund and the Exchequer.  It also provided funding for a range of policy areas, including a new STEM policy and curricular reform including in the areas of Agricultural Science, Applied Maths, Computer Science and Science.  <\/p>  <p>  The capital allocation for my Department for 2018 will be &euro;745 million, which is an increase of over &euro;50m on the 2017 capital allocation.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with the broad range of problems, behavioural, emotional and social. <\/p>  <p>  The processes span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. <\/p>  <p>  Wellbeing\u00a0Guidelines for Post-Primary (2013)\u00a0and\u00a0Primary Schools (2015) have been developed by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of research.  They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. \u00a0In addition Wellbeing Guidelines have been produced for the Junior Cycle\u00a0Programme introduced in September 2017.  This include a focus on mental health promotion. Professional development is currently being provided for\u00a0schools in anticipation of this. <\/p>  <p>  A range of external resources and initiatives are available to assist schools, among others, in supporting various aspects of a positive mental health process or relating to suicide prevention and crisis intervention such as the example instanced by the Deputy in his question.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines advise that in the event of pupils presenting with mental health difficulties which are above and beyond the school's capacity and ability to support, school authorities should identify and access the referral pathways for the various primary and secondary healthcare services in their particular area.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is available to advise schools on the matter. Referrals should, of course, be undertaken with Parental or Guardian consent and collaboration, except in an exceptional situation where there may be child protection issues. In normal circumstances referral to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) is made through the student's GP.  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department liaises extensively with the Department of Health and its agencies in relation to the rationalisation and co-ordination of mental health services at national, regional and local level.  This liaison has resulted in the development of operational protocols for co-operation between services and clarification of referral pathways for accessing mental health services.\u00a0 Awareness building for schools in mental health and well-being is supported by the health sector through overarching initiatives such as Healthy Ireland and Health Promoting School initiative.  At a more focussed level my Department in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has recently commenced a pilot programme of training in SafeTALK (suicide awareness skills) on a voluntary basis for teachers. \u00a0The Learning from this pilot phase will help determine the appropriate training needs for teachers at primary and\u00a0post primary level.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Within my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education in 2016\/19 mental health and well-being is afforded a justifiably high priority and is one of the key goals. The actions relating to well-being and mental health include: <\/p>  <p>  -  Delivery of support all schools to implement the national Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013 and the Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015)).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  -  Introduction of Wellbeing as a subject at\u00a0Junior Cycle: Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support\u00a0the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015.\u00a0The guidelines will be introduced to post-primary schools in\u00a0September this year.\u00a0 The Junior Cycle team are currently planning the support that will be in place for the implementation of the well-being Curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  -  Increasing the\u00a0capacity of NEPS: an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 11 educational\u00a0psychologists.\u00a0 The focus of this additional support\u00a0will be on extending the roll-out of teacher programmes to DEIS schools that build capacity to promote social and emotional competence, resilience and\u00a0school connectedness in all learners.<\/p>  <p>  -  Enhancing Guidance Provision at post-primary\u00a0level: Recent budgets saw improvements in guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017\u00a0together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 400 guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for\u00a0guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts). \u00a0The 400\u00a0 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently once again.<\/p>  <p>  As stated above the Guidelines themselves form a framework within which a broad range of existing processes and practices can be rationalised within schools and brought to bear within the context of a cogent well-being and mental health support for pupils in schools.\u00a0 Support to the school community in this regard is being provided from a number of sources within my Department including the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT).<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[5218\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which comprehensive school medical examinations remain in place with a view to ensuring early diagnosis and treatment in respect of conditions detected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>My Department does not operate the schools medical examinations service and I am not therefore in a position to comment on the matters raised by the Deputy. <\/p><p>These matters are therefore\u00a0appropriate\u00a0to my colleague, the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Data","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[5255\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of persons enrolled in apprenticeships in his Department and State agencies under his remit by gender in tabular form; and the detail of each such apprenticeship.","asker":"1221","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>Civil Servants are appointed to my Department following competitions conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).

The Programme is an &lsquo;all-of-Government&rsquo; initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation.\u00a0 The underlying proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement. There are five pillars of the Creative Ireland Programme.<\/p><p>The Pillar 1 plan is Creative Youth<b>&ndash; <\/b>a plan<b><\/b>to enable the creative potential of every child and young person.  This plan &ndash; Creative Youth &ndash; is about securing an opportunity for our children and young people to become creative citizens.  The Department of Education and Skills has a key role in implementing Pillar 1, and is working in partnership with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Arts Council, and\u00a0the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. <\/p><p>The &Oacute;ige Ild&aacute;nach\/Creative Youth Plan<b><\/b>was launched by An Taoiseach in early December 2017.  The Creative Ireland Pillar 1 commitment is to &lsquo;enable every child in Ireland to have practical access to tuition, experience\u00a0and participation in music, drama, art\u00a0and coding by 2022.&rsquo;  The Creative Youth plan sets out four high level strategies to work under in the coming years:<\/p><p>1. Supporting collaboration between Formal and Non-Formal approaches to Creativity in Education<\/p><p>2. Extending the Range of Creative Activities for our Young People<\/p><p>3. Embedding the Creative Process<\/p><p>4. Continuing Professional Development (CPD)<\/p><p>Seventeen actions have been identified for 2018\/19 under the Creative Youth Plan.  These actions are either the expansion of existing pilot initiatives or new programmes being piloted and encompass some of the commitments in the Arts in Education Charter.  The following actions are among those included in the plan, at least part of which may be drama and theatre-based initiatives:<\/p><p>-  Scoileanna Ild&aacute;nacha\/Creative Schools initiative will be implemented. <\/p><p>Formerly developed as AR&Iacute;S under the Arts in Education Charter, Creative Schools will be piloted in 150 schools across two academic years.  As part of the programme, schools will work with Creative Associates (a mixture of teachers and artists) to reinforce the impact of arts and creativity on student learning and development.  They will work in partnership schools, clustered by region, to develop the knowledge, expertise and approaches that will embed each school&rsquo;s creative practice, providing a mechanism for these schools to share learning with other schools.<\/p><p>-  A Creative Clusters scheme will be piloted. <\/p><p>This initiative is still being scoped out. However, it is envisaged that it will commence in September 2018 as a pilot project.\u00a0 This opportunity for schools to form clusters will be made available in order to generate creative cultural and artistic projects. Cluster meetings will be held in Education Centres, with each cluster consisting of a range of primary and post-primary schools. Seed funding would be provided to clusters based on the number of participating schools to allow them to progress projects.\u00a0 This scheme will be funded under my Departments School Excellence Fund.<\/p><p>-  Youth Theatre <\/p><p>There are currently 55 youth theatres in Ireland: the target is to substantially expand this number by 2022, commencing in 2019. <\/p><p>-  Local Creative Youth Partnerships will be established on a pilot basis. <\/p><p>Building on the model for Local Arts Education Partnerships contained in the Arts in Education Charter, Local Creative Youth Partnerships will be established to provide support and delivery mechanisms for optimisation of local creativity resources.  As part of this, new and existing collaborative youth creativity initiatives across the country, will be able to apply for funding, based on provided guidelines, administered through the ETB network.

At that time Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority appointed and underway.  The Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions under the 2015 Act, has convened regularly since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 - minutes of its meetings are available on its website . <\/p><p>During its initial year of establishment, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and in the making of five reports on a series of new options for the provision of legal services under sections 118 to 120 of the Act which were also commenced.  It had been obliged to complete these within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016.  All of these reports have now been laid, as required under the 2015 Act, before the Houses of the Oireachtas while also being publicly accessible on the Authority&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>As reflected in the 2015 Act and the relevant reports completed by the Authority, the Government continues to give policy priority to the introduction of Legal Partnerships by way of structural reform of the legal services sector.  It is appreciated that this places additional working demands on the Authority which has, nonetheless, been consulting with the legal professional bodies and conducting workshops in preparation for their introduction.<\/p><p>Alongside its ongoing consultation and reporting commitments, the current working focus of the Authority is, I understand, very much on the managed roll-out of its remaining functions. This includes the matching development of the organisational capacities and office and staffing resources essential to effective delivery.  It also includes the necessary preparatory steps for the establishment and application of the new Roll of Practicing Barristers under which both Law Library and non-Law Library practicing barristers will be regulated, for the first time under legislation, by the Authority.  This will also be a pre-requisite for the exercise by the Authority of its public complaints functions.  A further key area under development is that of the application of the levy that is to be made on both practicing solicitors and practicing barristers under Part 7 of the 2015 Act.  Funding support of &euro;1 million has recently been provided to the Authority from the Justice Vote for 2017.  This follows an advance of the same amount that was provided from my Department&rsquo;s 2016 Vote.<\/p><p>It should also be recalled that in parallel to the introduction of enhanced legal costs transparency obligations on legal practitioners under the 2015 Act, extensive legal and technical preparations are also continuing separately within the courts system to complete the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators. <\/p><p>Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers, will be commenced.  It is considered that this component of the Act will underpin the entire new regulatory regime in terms of its observance and enforcement. I will, of course, continue to emphasise the importance which I attach as Minister to the objective of getting the Authority open for business on the core public complaints function as quickly as is reasonably possible while also bearing in mind the risks and complexities which must be carefully managed to bring that about.<\/p><p>The Regulatory Authority is actively preparing to conduct the first periodic review of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as required under section 6 of that Act.  This must be commenced not later than eighteen months after the Authority's establishment day and its outcomes reported to each House of the Oireachtas within twelve months.  Moreover, the Authority is putting the practical arrangements in place for the provision, on foot of appropriate public consultations, of the required statutory report in relation to the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided.  This report, which has to be provided to me as Minister within two years of the Authority&rsquo;s establishment day, will cover an array of matters set out within section 34 of the 2015 Act and be laid before the Houses. <\/p><p>Work has also commenced in preparation for the submission of the Authority's first three-year Strategic Plan under section 20 of the 2015 Act.  The Authority will also be submitting its first full-year Annual Report having previously submitted a report for quarter three of 2016. Work is also ongoing between the Authority and my Department on a new Corporate Governance Assurance Agreement.  Arrangements are also underway to fill, with the necessary approval of each House of the Oireachtas, a casual vacancy that has arisen on the Authority due to the appointment of an existing member to the Judiciary.<\/p><p>The Authority is nearing completion of the necessary analysis of the staffing needs and resources required to allow it to support the ongoing roll out of its functions to a structured and achievable timetable and intends to begin additional recruiting to key posts in the near future.  There has been continued direct engagement between the Authority and my Department as well as between the Authority and other key stakeholders.  This work has been augmented by the recent appointment by the Authority of its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty, along with its securing of enhanced office accommodation.<\/p><p>Against this background of complex and competing working demands, both I and my Department will continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity and with appropriate staffing and project management.  I am also anticipating an early opportunity to engage further myself with the Authority to discuss progress in relation to these matters.  At the same time, it will be appreciated that the Authority is earnestly working to progress the identification and elaboration, in conjunction with my Department, of the more specific delivery dates concerned.  I expect these will be made known as soon as they have been aligned, to the satisfaction of the Authority, with its anticipated working resources as an independent regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[4984\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will extend the time limit for complaints from three years to five years in view of the delays affecting the establishment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>I would like to begin my Reply by clarifying that under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 there will be no time limit for complaints concerning allegations of professional misconduct by a legal practitioner.  The three-year time limit to which the Deputy has referred will apply only to those complaints of a more minor nature that are made about inadequate services or excessive fees at what could be described as a consumer level.  This is similar to the current regime that applies under the Solicitors' Acts albeit with a five-year limitation period in relation to the more minor level consumer complaints category.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to complaints made under the 2015 Act about legal practitioners, a three-year time limit applies under section 58(7) to those consumer type complaints about \"inadequate services\" or \"excessive fees\" that may be made under section 51(1) of the Act once commenced.  That is to say, complaints about behaviour around these particular issues at a more minor level that would not be considered to amount to &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo; as such.  The application of the three-year time period under the 2015 Act is intended to encourage the early, informal and less costly resolution of these more minor consumer level complaints between the client and lawyer concerned. <\/p>  <p>  However, a clear distinction must be drawn between such consumer level complaints and those of a more serious nature relating to allegations of professional misconduct by solicitors or barristers that can be made to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority under section 51(2) of the 2015 Act once commenced.  This includes, where appropriate, by referral of the matters concerned to the Complaints Committee and to the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal that will be established under the Act. Section 50 of the Act sets out those acts or omissions by a legal practitioner that may be considered as constituting misconduct for that purpose including the charging of fees that would be considered to be grossly excessive.  There will be no time limit on the making of such complaints to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority concerning allegations of professional misconduct by a legal practitioner. <\/p>  <p>  All in all, I think the application of a three year limitation period to the making of consumer level complaints, and of no limitation period to complaints relating to allegations of professional misconduct, continue to represent a reasonable balance of the weight and gravity of the matters concerned and this is set to remain the policy position.  Pending the commencement of those provisions of Part 6 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 under which the new public complaints regime will come into operation, the current complaints framework under the Solicitors' Acts will continue to be available to the public.  Any complaints made about solicitors through the Law Society under the existing framework of the Solicitors&rsquo; Acts will, of course, have to be completed under the existing law and procedures that apply for that purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Operations","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03000"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[4990\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if legal privilege may attach to information regarding the names of persons sitting on a working group convened by a Department.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has a very wide range of responsibilities, including matters relating to the law, courts, law enforcement and national security.\u00a0 In the absence of further detail on the kind of working group envisaged, the subject matter of its discussions and the composition of its membership, it is difficult to give a definitive answer to this question.\u00a0 In any case, to the extent that the question appears to be seeking legal advice\u00a0or\u00a0an interpretation of the law, it would not be appropriate for me to\u00a0comment on it in response to a parliamentary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Censorship of Publications","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03300"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[5061\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of publications referred to the Censorship of Publications Board per annum since 2000; the number of publications prohibited per annum since 2000, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[5062\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members on the Censorship of Publications Board in each of the years 2011 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and the cost of the board per annum in those years.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[5063\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100051#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members on the Censorship of Publications appeals board from 2010 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and the cost of the board per annum in those years.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 to 151, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>In Ireland, as in many other countries, the right of freedom of expression is subject to certain restrictions that are justified in the public interest.

This level of complaint would be considered more amenable to early, informal resolution between the client and lawyer concerned with the facilitation of the Authority.

These latter two posts have been filled.<\/p>  <p>  The competition for the position of Chief Data Officer is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service (PAS) on behalf of the Top Level Appointments Committee as is generally the case with civilian service posts at this senior level.

The expert oversight by the CSO of crime statistics is welcome in order to ensure that we can have confidence in the official crime statistics and can tailor our policies accordingly.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that when a homicide occurs, the offence may be classified as murder, manslaughter or violent death.  Of course in all the cases in question the crime was recorded and recorded as a homicide.  My understanding is that an issue emerged due to the fact that the classification of a crime may change as investigations evolve, for example, a murder charge may ultimately lead to a manslaughter conviction in the Courts, or an assault causing harm may subsequently result in a death some time later, necessitating a reclassification to murder or manslaughter.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extended the review to cover the period from 2003-2017.  This is obviously a time consuming and complex process but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate.  While the review is underway, the CSO has suspended the publication of quarterly crime statistics with the most recent figures being for Q4 2016. The review has not been published as it is not yet complete however the details will be made public on completion. <\/p>  <p>  While I note that a figure of 41 deaths requiring reclassification has been mentioned in public discourse, this is incorrect. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that the examination of 524 cases for the period 2013-2015 identified 41 cases which required further examination and, out of those 41 cases, 12 deaths were identified which required reclassifications on PULSE - a total of 2.3% of all cases reviewed. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in the review of the 41 cases, it was identified that each death was fully investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also indicated that their Family Liaison Officers were in contact with the families of the 12 deceased persons whose PULSE records required reclassification.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority continues to monitor this issue and ensure that there is independent scrutiny of how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na records data and I welcome their continued diligence in this matter. I also note the statement made by the Authority earlier today indicating that these issues will be considered again at the Authority's meeting with the Garda Commissioner, to be held in public on 22 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of this meeting, I can also advise the Deputy that I, along with officials from my Department, will be meeting with representatives from the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na next week to discuss the progress being made on this important issue. <\/p>  <p>  My Department remains in close contact with the CSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure an early return to the publication of official Crime Statistics by the CSO at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100052#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100052#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[5142\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100052#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of staff per district probate office and general probate office in each of he years 2011 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[5143\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100052#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual overall budget of each probate office in each of the years 2011 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.<\/p><p>The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.

The LEO can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p><p>The LEO can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEO can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand.  (It should be noted that the LEO does not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction\/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).  In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.<\/p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEO may be able to offer 'soft' support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).<\/p><p>Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEO.  The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.<\/p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to Microfinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.<\/p><p>I should also draw your attention to the 'Supporting SMEs' Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.

The Plan is stimulating job creation across the region, including Counties Cavan and Monaghan, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support regional enterprise projects. <\/p>  <p>  The core objective of the Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within 1% of the State average. <\/p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing\/engineering and tourism.  The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Counties Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The third progress report covering the period from June-December 2017 is being finalised and shows that good progress is being made.  The progress reports are available on www.regionalapj.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Some 12,000 jobs were created in the Border region since the regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative was launched in January 2015 while the unemployment rate in the region has fallen since then and now stands at 6.5% according to the CSO.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Live Register numbers have fallen in County Cavan by 16.1% and in County Monaghan by 15.3% in the past 12 months.  There is of course always room for improvement but the latest CSO figures are testament to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help create jobs and reduce unemployment.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund with funding of up to &euro;60m, designed to support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  The first call under this Fund concluded last August, with results announced on 11th December and 21 projects were successful, totalling &euro;30.5m in aggregate grant support. The second call will fund projects from the remaining balance of the &euro;60m budget available, and is expected to issue in Q1 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Monaghan County Enterprise Fund is one of the 21 collaborative projects that secured funding under Stream 3 which is designed to support Local &amp;amp; Community Enterprise Development Projects with grants of &euro;50,000 up to &euro;250,000 per project.  The project involves the development of a Regional Food Centre of Excellence and a range of Food Product development supports.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets.  In 2017, EI paid &euro;2.5m to companies in Cavan and &euro;7.2m to companies in Monaghan. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Capital allocations of &euro;565,001 and &euro;583,428 were made available to LEO Monaghan and LEO Cavan respectively in 2018 to fund investment in their clients by way of grants and a range of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports, such as training and mentoring.

This Strategy is focused on:<\/p>  <p>  - Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;<\/p>  <p>  - Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and<\/p>  <p>  - Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to work closely with Enterprise Ireland to drive this Strategy, to ensure that it continues to support companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate, increase our exports and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.  In recent months, with the support of my Department, EI has launched new measures to strengthen the rural and regional economy and to provide quicker access to innovation funding for exporting companies.  This includes the new &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund\u00a0mentioned earlier\u00a0and a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund. <\/p>  <p>  My priority, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is to drive creation of high-quality and sustainable employment across Ireland, including in Cavan and Monaghan. We are making significant progress towards achieving our regional development targets, which include a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in the North East Region. There are 36 multinational companies based in this region, employing 5,007 staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100054#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100054#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[5168\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100054#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the reports that the European Commission is to propose a yearly tariff rate quota of 90,000 tonnes of beef, 20,000 tonnes more than offered in October 2017, to South American countries in the latest round of Mercosur negotiations;

by Enterprise Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, Ireland has strong concerns in relation to agriculture, especially the potential impact that these negotiations present to the EU beef sector. \u00a0While all FTA&rsquo;s include agricultural market access and TRQs (Tariff Rate Quotas), TRQs provided under such agreements are not always fully utilised by our trading partners. \u00a0Equally, most Member States tend to have sensitives in relation to certain goods or services to be comprehended under an FTA.<\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the issues faced by the Agriculture sector and the challenges posed by a trade agreement with Mercosur. \u00a0In the context of these negotiations, Ireland has many &ldquo;offensive&rdquo;

The model consists of three care pathways - supported, assisted and specialised.<\/p><p>The Supported Care Pathway is intended for normal-risk mothers and babies, with midwives leading and delivering care within a multidisciplinary framework.  Care will be delivered by the community midwifery team, with most antenatal and postnatal care being provided in the community and home settings.  The woman can exercise a choice with her healthcare professional with regard to the birth setting, which may be in an Alongside Birth Centre in the hospital, or at home.  The Strategy makes it clear that women should be offered choice regarding their preferred pathway of care, in line with their clinical needs and best practice.<\/p><p>The phased implementation of the Strategy will be led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  To this end, the Programme has developed a detailed Implementation Plan which I was pleased to launch in October 2017.  The Plan seeks to ensure that each Maternity Network\/Hospital Group will have all three care pathways in place and operational in 2018.  The Plan also provides that by early 2019, a minimum of 20% of pregnant women presenting at our maternity hospitals\/units, including within the Saolta University Health Care Group, will have access to the supported care pathway.<\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly in response to your more detailed queries regarding implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services within the Saolta University Health Care Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Access","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[5008\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a referral to another health facility is possible for a person (details supplied) in County\u00a0Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[5009\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options available to a person (details supplied) who is unable to secure employment in the health sector here having previously worked outside of the State due to the requisite documentation being unattainable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[5019\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100055#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a medical card for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

While this is under development, both the Department and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home care services.  As detailed in its <i>National Service Plan,<\/i>the HSE has begun work on streamlining home care services by moving towards a single funded home support service. This brings together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which will operate as a single home support service from 2018 onwards.  The additional resources made available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408m. <\/p><p>This new approach will provide significant benefits for the service users, the public and the health system including: <\/p><p>- making the services easier to understand;<\/p><p>- streamlining the application processes resulting in only one application and decision being required for home support services for older people; and <\/p><p>- facilitating service users to move to changed levels of services as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home hours combined), an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people. In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  <\/p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow. It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available. Home care is monitored on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs and within the overall available resources for home care and having regard to demand throughout the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100057#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100057#WRR01200"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[5181\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100057#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will issue in the case of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Ireland&rsquo;s key tasks in this regard will continue to be: continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures; minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries; and maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s quota shares.<\/p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.

This contrasts with other EU member states which have had severe difficulties in negotiating\u00a0successful renewals of their derogations.<\/p>  <p>  The achievement of securing the renewal of the derogation is a significant milestone in the context of an expanding dairy herd and increasing milk production. While there are some additional stipulations attached to the derogation, these are the outcome of a year long negotiations with the Commission and two separate public consultations.  It was important when seeking the renewal that Ireland demonstrated commitment to tackling agricultural impacts on water.<\/p>  <p>  The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s derogation take account of the growing numbers of derogation farmers who are farming at intensive stocking rates, and also environmental objectives for water, climate change and ammonia which Ireland must achieve. Furthermore, opportunities for large savings on farms through better grassland management and improved timing and application of fertiliser have been taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is responsible for 98% of ammonia emissions and under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive, Ireland must reduce its ammonia emissions by 5%, by 2030 compared to 2005.  Ammonia losses from slurry are significantly reduced by slurry application in the springtime and also by using low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment.<\/p>  <p>  It is now required that 50% of slurry produced on a derogation farm\u00a0must be\u00a0applied by 15th June and after that date\u00a0it may only be applied by\u00a0LESS equipment. Furthermore derogation farmers must have adequate manure storage for their animals. These new measures will assist farmers to deliver their production targets, reduce their greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions and reduce the risk of runoff to water quality.<\/p>  <p>  In order to\u00a0help farmers with the purchase of LESS equipment, support is\u00a0provided under\u00a0the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II is, subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme, at a general grant rate of 40% rising to 60% for qualifying Young Farmers.

The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended,  specifies that participation in activation meetings is mandatory and this obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by my Department&rsquo;s own case officers or those advisors employed by external contractors such as the Local Employment Services or the JobPath Service.  <\/p><p>Participants with the JobPath service are not required to sign a contract with the JobPath companies but they are, in the same manner as all customers referred to any of the other Department&rsquo;s activation services, requested to agree and sign a personal progression plan (PPP).  The PPP is a joint agreement between the customer and their personal advisor and is an integral part of the activation process.

Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is making this TCA option available to people earlier than planned to deal with the anomaly that has existed in the yearly averaging approach since its introduction in 1961, i.e., that two people with the same number of contributions could get paid different pensions because of differences in the length of time over which those contributions were made.<\/p>  <p>  Those who are less likely to benefit from this TCA model are people with lower numbers of paid social insurance contributions, who have no significant homemaking\/caring periods.  However, it should be understood that no current pensioner will have a reduced rate of payment as a result of this announcement.  Anyone who is not better off as a result of this proposal will remain on their existing rate of payment.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA model of pensions calculation was first announced in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the proposal to assess all new pensioners under this approach from around 2020.  Officials in my Department have been working on the introduction of a TCA since 2015.  The recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund has been used to explore the costs of various options and to inform the design of the Total Contributions Approach.  This Review was recently completed and published.  The Department is now considering the costings produced.  Later this year, it will publish a paper on the full TCA model to be introduced from around 2020 onwards.  It will then engage in a public consultation on it.  This consultation will be a key input to the design of the final structure of the TCA model, which will include the number of years required for a maximum rate of pension, and the treatment of credited contributions and homemaking periods, to be submitted to Government later this year.  Subsequent to this, legislation will be introduced to the Oireachtas. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not possible to extrapolate what a person&rsquo;s pension may be subsequent to the introduction of the full TCA on the basis of the measures announced by the Government on   23 January 2018.  Whether someone reaching pension age in 2020 or beyond will receive a higher or lower pension under the full TCA model will depend on a number of factors, including the final design of the scheme, and their own circumstances.  The Deputy refers to &ldquo;gaps in work years other than those spent caring or unemployed&rdquo;, and these will include people who were in receipt of other payments such as Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, which also may attract credited contributions.  People who were in receipt of an Invalidity Pension, or a Widows Contributory Pension, at the time they reach State pension age will generally receive a contributory pension at the maximum rate.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the examples the Deputy gives, e.g. where someone worked only 10 years, and have no other credited contributions (e.g. from periods on jobseekers benefit), nor home-caring periods (pre-1994 or post-1994), and yet are dependent upon the Irish State pension are highly unrepresentative of those on lower rate bands.  Reckonable PRSI contributions can be awarded from ages 16 to 65 inclusive, or 50 full years.  Most adults would have been engaged in some activity for most of that time that either attracted PRSI coverage, or which will attract HomeCaring Credits. Very few would have been resident all that time, but would have 40 years where they were neither covered for PRSI nor engaged in home caring.<\/p>  <p>  People who spent time working abroad might be expected to have entitlements from their time spent in those countries, which may be co-ordinated under EU regulations or bilateral agreements, which can result in a more advantageous outcome for that pensioner.  For example, the TCA will not benefit someone who arrives in Ireland in their early 50s, who can currently receive a full Irish pension for 10 years work, despite having significant additional pension entitlements accrued in another country over the previous 30 years.  As in most countries, such Irish contributions will attract a partial contributory pension, proportionate to their contributions, and they will cease attracting higher pensions than those who may have contributed far more into the system.   However, most will have significant contributions in another country which will attract a second pension from there,<\/p>  <p>  While it is true that time spent in full-time education may result in several years when they did not pay into the Social Insurance Fund, a person has 50 years to build up their contributions record, and few if any people will study so many years, without part-time work attracting PRSI, that they will be unable to work up at least 40 years contributions.  <\/p>  <p>  People who have a lower State pension (contributory) entitlement can apply for and may qualify for a higher State pension (non-contributory) of up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  This is a means-tested payment, but over 70% qualify at the maximum rate due to generous income disregards.  If someone spent most of their working life not in employment and in receipt of social welfare payments, this will generally mean their income will increase by over &euro;40 per week upon reaching State pension age. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100066#WRAA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100066#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[5054\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100066#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to problems with the C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CI&Eacute;, pension schemes; and the steps she will take to address the issues which relates to the pensions of nearly 10,000 members.","asker":"1305","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":877,"content":"<p>C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann (CI&Eacute;) is a State body under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has a social insurance record of 1,637 reckonable contributions and credits, based on an assessed yearly average of 33 contributions, covering their working life from date of entry into insurable employment in July 1969 to end 2016.  The person concerned has no recorded contributions for the tax years 1978\/79 to 1987\/88 inclusive or 1989\/90 to 1992\/93 and has a number of partially complete years.  This affects their overall yearly average and, consequently, their rate of weekly pension entitlement.  The person was notified of their state pension (contributory) entitlement on 10 February 2017 and informed that they were better off to remain on their existing payment which would become payable at the increased &lsquo;over age 66&rsquo; rate with effect from their 66th birthday.

On completion, the outcome of that review will be notified to the person concerned without delay.

It will take some time to draft and pass the necessary legislation, and then develop the systems and procedures necessary to administer the new pension entitlement option.  Accordingly, it is not necessary for any person to contact the Department about their situation.  Instead, the Department expects to start issuing invitations to these pensioners from Quarter 4 2018 to apply for a review under the new pension eligibility arrangements, and to notify any periods spent caring for which HomeCaring credits may be due.  Review applicants will be notified of the outcome of their review and any applicable higher rate of entitlement will be paid to them.  Such payments are expected to commence from Q1 2019.

In this regard, information sessions have been organised for Chairpersons of local services, providing opportunities for Chairpersons to seek clarifications on the process of transfer to the new regional companies and wind up of the existing companies.<\/p>  <p>  MABS National Management Forum (NMF) was established as a representative body for the 51 local MABS management companies.  It represents the interests of the boards of local MABS companies, as employers.  MABS NMF has not recognised the union of MABS staff and there are no agreed collective bargaining arrangements in place.   <\/p>  <p>  Individual MABS companies engaging with the TUPE process are and will continue to be supported by CIB.  On establishment, CIB will support the eight new MABS regional companies to promptly put in place an Employer\/Union Forum. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100067#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100067#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[5171\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100067#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the entitlements of State contributory pension recipients who were self-employed and in receipt of farm assist payments prior to 2007 will be reviewed; the estimated cost of granting a credit to those self-employed farm assist recipients who were not permitted to make PRSI class S contributions prior to 2007 to ensure low-income farmers in receipt can avail of full pension entitlements; the number of persons this PRSI issue relates to; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":906,"content":"<p>The farm assist scheme was introduced in 1999 to provide income support for low income farmers.

The retirement age of 55 years of age was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.

This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. <\/p>  <p>  The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. <\/p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.

The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.

Therefore, the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro prudential lending regulations do not apply to local authority mortgage lending.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the fixed rate Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is to deliver affordability and sustainability through certainty of repayments.  The new mortgage arrangements regularise local authority lending with the prudent and cautious lending rules of the Central Bank. Borrowers are required to have a 10% deposit; evidence of savings; and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with a robust credit policy.<\/p>  <p>  The unique aspect of this new mortgage offering is the fixed interest rate over the full lifetime of the borrowing. This means that risks normally associated with interest rate changes are eliminated. Borrowers therefore have absolute certainty of their repayments for terms of up to 25 or 30 years. Moreover, the local authority as lender has much more certainty of the borrowers&rsquo; capacity to repay the debt over the lifetime of the loan. <\/p>  <p>  The long term fixed rate offering obviates the need for stress testing as the repayments are fixed for the life of the loan.  Rather than a Loan to Income (LTI) limit, a maximum permissible Net Disposable Income (NDI) ratio of 35% is used which more accurately reflects the benefit of the low fixed rate available for the full life of the loan.  <\/p>  <p>  The credit and income assessments which underpin the loan are firmly based on a borrower&rsquo;s capacity to repay the loan.  Likewise, the assessments take account of borrowers&rsquo; outgoings and household commitments. Together with the certainty of the amount that a mortgage repayment will be over the entire term of the mortgage, this means that borrowers are in a much more secure position than would be the case in a variable rate position, or if assessment was singularly linked to a multiple of income.

This recommendation was accepted by Eurostat, with a proviso that the decision could be reviewed at a future date. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2017, the CSO made a decision that 14 of the 16 largest AHBs examined (i.e. those with 300+ homes in their property portfolios) in the initial phase of the review should be re-classified as falling within the public sector, under the broad local government classification. This decision has been sent to Eurostat for their consideration and ultimate determination.<\/p>  <p>  While a final decision has yet to be taken by Eurostat regarding the classification of AHB expenditure, detailed analysis of the potential impacts on the Government debt and expenditure will be completed by the relevant Departments and Agencies. To inform these considerations, the CSO is currently engaged in collecting the required data to compile the end-March 2018 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) notification tables (also known as the Maastricht returns), covering general government deficit and debt. At the same time, the Department of Finance is also preparing the Stability Programme Update 2018.

Similarly, the potential impact on the housing funding programmes as referred to by the Deputy is being examined both through this process and internally within my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the assessment by the CSO, the Government still sees an important role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland, and we intend to press ahead with our ambitious plans to use all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain our planned momentum towards meeting the 50,000 Rebuilding Ireland social housing target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100068#WRCC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Data","counter":948,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100068#WRCC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":949,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[5260\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100068#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of persons enrolled in apprenticeships in his Department and State agencies under his remit, by gender, in tabular form; and if he will list each such apprenticeship.","asker":"1221","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":950,"content":"<p>There are currently no staff in my Department enrolled in apprenticeship programmes.<\/p><p>The details requested in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the individual bodies concerned.

One of the primary aims of the scheme is to trial bespoke measures for enhanced management of biodiversity at farm level, with a view to informing current and future measures under the Rural Development Programme.<\/p><p>The NPWS Farm Plan Scheme was entirely exchequer-funded. At its peak, the costs of the scheme were circa &euro;5 million per annum. The scheme was scaled back in 2010 due to budgetary constraints arising from the financial crisis.
