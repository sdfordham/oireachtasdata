The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out his functions under the Valuation Acts and I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in this regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, the annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each local authority and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all commercial sectors, including units selling petrol.  This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within each rating authority area in order to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.  The National Revaluation Programme is the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years, and is being conducted across the country on a phased basis.  This is a welcome development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made. Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern that is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.<\/p>  <p>  The current phase of the revaluation programme (known as \"REVAL 2017\") covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area. Revaluation in these counties is expected to be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.  The Commissioner's intention is to then extend the revaluation programme to other counties.<\/p>  <p>  Following revaluation, there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of all rateable properties in a local authority area and their respective commercial rates liabilities.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.  This applies to service stations and retail fuel outlets as it does to hotels, retail outlets, industrial units and all other categories of property.  A key element of revaluation is to remove anomalies in the system where they exist and establish fair and equitable relativities between the various property classifications.  Having regard to the revaluations conducted to date, it would be expected that many small businesses in rural Ireland will see their rates liability decrease following a revaluation.<\/p>  <p>  The basic premise under valuation legislation is that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended. I am informed that the Valuation Office values service stations and retail fuel outlets by reference to their turnover and throughput and their rates liability should, accordingly, take account of the trading circumstances of the particular service station, whether rural or urban, as referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  While acknowledging the important contribution which service stations with associated retail outlets make to the rural economy, there are no plans for special treatment of such stations under the Valuation Acts, which maintain the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. <\/p>  <p>  Pending the revaluation of all of the commercial properties in a local authority area, revisions of the valuation of individual properties will continue to be carried out by the Valuation Office.  The revision process provides for the updating of valuations on the existing valuation list so that new properties can be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  There is an extensive system of redress available to those ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations or with any particular on the certificate relating to their property.  In this regard, a dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900063#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900063#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[6419\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900063#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons within her Department tasked with drafting legislation and their job titles; if legislative drafting is their sole responsibility or if this is in addition to other roles; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, drafting legislation is the function of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC), which is located in the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>There are two divisions of my Department, the Civil Law Reform Division and the Criminal Law Reform Division, which are primarily tasked with policy analysis and preparation of legislative proposals and schemes of legislation, including drafting instructions for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in respect of items which are either on the Government legislative programme or contemplated for future Government legislative programmes.<\/p><p>These divisions comprise of 32 staff, details below, in various different areas of expertise, who are involved day-to-day in such work.

The role of INIS must be understood in the broader context of the English language (ELT) sector in Ireland more generally, and my Department's responsibility in relation to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals.<\/p><p>The sector, which predominantly operates in the commercial sphere, recruits students from a wide range of international markets with a particular focus on recruitment from within the EEA.  English language programmes are targeted at juvenile (which make up the majority of seasonal English language students each year) and adult students.  Programmes of varying duration are on offer, including short intensive programmes usually less than three months, and longer examination-focused programmes of six or more months duration.  The sector is not structured in a way that reflects the immigration and border control arrangements in the State and, as such, straddles all categories of international students both European and further afield.<\/p><p>In addition to EEA persons, who do not require permission from the immigration services to be in the State, for non-EEA nationals, registration information is recorded on the basis of the individual student and not the educational institution.  Also, only persons intending to remain in the State longer than ninety days are obliged to register their presence with the immigration authorities and this obligation applies only to non-EEA nationals over sixteen years of age.  Accordingly, the specific information sought by the Deputy is not available.  <\/p><p>In 2015 the Government introduced revised arrangements as regards student immigration.  In particular, educational providers intending to recruit non-EEA international students to programmes longer than ninety (90) days duration must be listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes ILEP.  The list is only open to those offering English language (of 25 weeks or more) and higher education programmes (leading to a recognised award by an Irish awarding body) and providers are prohibited from recruiting non-EEA international students to other categories of programme.  As part of the process of being listed on the ILEP, providers must submit a clear capacity statement setting out the maximum number of students that can be accommodated within their existing physical teaching resources. <\/p><p>A table sets out the top ten English language providers in order of their stated maximum capacity.  It is important to bear in mind that this table only relates to those providers seeking to recruit non-EEA international students to programmes of at least twenty five weeks duration.

This proposal constitutes a development of the border provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002\/192\/EC.  Ireland is not bound by the Regulation or subject to its application.  When the amendments are introduced, Irish citizens will be subject to the same checks entering the Schengen Area as other European Union citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to progress a broad series of initiatives to strengthen border security.  For instance, since November 2016 an automated connection to INTERPOL&rsquo;s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database was rolled out to all international airports and seaports.  In the first eight weeks of operating systematic checks against this Database over 700,000 documents were searched, with a number of people having been refused entry to Ireland on the basis of an alert on the system having been triggered.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year the Irish immigration authorities will begin to process Advance Passenger Information on flights into the State from outside the EU and preparations are also underway to implement the EU Directive on Passenger Name Records (PNR).

This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System (SIS II), participating in other EU measures such as PRUM, and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering security threats.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the specific Regulation, Brexit does not impact on this as both Ireland and the UK are currently outside Schengen and this is not expected to change.  I should point out that in the context of 'Brexit' while it is not possible at this juncture to say what arrangements will apply between the UK and the EU, particularly in respect of the movement of EU citizens (as this will ultimately be a matter that will feature within the negotiation process that will take place following the UK's formal notification to the European Council that it intends to leave), what I can make clear is that, while we will continue to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement, Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900064#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Relations Contracts Data","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900064#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[6542\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900064#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the level of expenditure by her Department or any organisation under the aegis of her Department for each of the years from 2005 to 2016, in tabular form, on photography, advertising, communications advice, public relations, website development, interview training and preparation, including details of the events, campaigns or policies to which this expenditure related, and the company or individual to whom such payments were made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1276","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that it has not been possible to collate the information required in the time available.

Ireland s 12.5% corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In a recent research paper 'Corporate Taxation and Foreign Direct Investment in EU Countries: Policy Implications for Ireland', the Economic and Social Research Institute ( ESRI ) outlined the importance of the 12.5% rate in attracting FDI.  The paper demonstrates that amongst all EU countries, Ireland would be the most sensitive to a change in the corporate tax rate in its ability to secure FDI.  An increase in Ireland s statutory corporate tax rate of 1% would be associated with a reduction in its probability of being chosen as a location for FDI projects from non-EU countries by 4.6%. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in October 2015\u00a0the OECD published the final reports on their project regarding Base Erosion and Profit Shifiting or BEPS.\u00a0\u00a0I welcomed the publication of the final BEPS reports.\u00a0 From the beginning, the key aim of the BEPS project has been to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity and, as such, the BEPS project is one which aligns with Ireland's own tax strategy.\u00a0 Ireland has been a strong supporter of the\u00a0BEPS project and I believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning. Ireland\u00a0will now play an active part in the work to implement the BEPS recommendations globally.\u00a0 The post-BEPS environment, which will see companies seek to better align the amount of tax that they pay with their substantive operations, will result in opportunities for Ireland.\u00a0 The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has long been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing commitment to the 12.5% rate, as stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, is extremely important for Ireland s economy.\u00a0\u00a0 I believe that Ireland's long-term commitment to the 12.5% rate will ensure that we remain highly competitive and will\u00a0support Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment from around the world.\u00a0\u00a0Our European colleagues are fully aware of our position in relation to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900065#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900065#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[6640\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900065#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated number of jobs projected to be created for the next five year period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>The table sets out my Department's Budget 2017 employment projections. <\/p><p>Overall, it is forecast that approximately 190,000 net additional jobs will be created over the five year period from 2016 to 2021.

to which the Deputy refers are not currently regulated activities in Ireland. In June 2014 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a Consumer Notice on Crowdfunding which alerts consumers to the fact that crowdfunding is not a regulated activity.  The notice can be found via the following link: .<\/p><p>There are currently several crowdfunding platforms active in the Irish market and the Government recognises that crowdfunding can be a valuable source of funding for SMEs either as a complement to, or as an alternative to traditional bank finance.  The European Commission recently published a detailed report which finds that several member states of the EU\u00a0have developed, or are in the process of developing national regulatory regimes but currently\u00a0there is no evidence of a\u00a0firm proposal from\u00a0the\u00a0Commission to bring forward an EU regulatory initiative.<\/p><p>The Department of Finance is currently undertaking a detailed analysis of crowdfunding and is engaging with the Central Bank of Ireland in advance of holding a Public Consultation on the Regulation of Crowdfunding in Q1 2017.  I am not in favour of considering changes to the\u00a0tax treatment of investments made via such platforms in\u00a0advance of the conclusion of this review and the regulation of the sector.  The Deputy will also note that my Department has published guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation which need to be considered in relation to any new proposals for tax expenditures. Some of the key evaluation questions that need to be addressed as part\u00a0of\u00a0such evaluations are:<\/p><p>(i) What objective does the tax expenditure aim to achieve?<\/p><p>(ii) What market failure is being addressed?<\/p><p>(iii) Is a tax expenditure the best approach to address the market failure?<\/p><p>(iv) What economic effect is the tax expenditure likely to have?<\/p><p>(v) How much is it expected to cost?<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's second question, I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy concerning\u00a0the current\u00a0yield to the Exchequer from the taxation of investment earnings from\u00a0crowd-funding loans\u00a0to small and medium enterprises.

The Financial Stability Group (the successor to the Principals' Group), which includes the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA, is assessing geopolitical risks including changes in other jurisdictions' financial regulation which could affect the global financial system.  The Deputy will be aware that at a European\u00a0and national level,\u00a0financial legislation and regulation has undergone significant reform and strengthening since the financial crisis. <\/p>  <p>  In an Irish context, these comprehensive\u00a0reforms, as well as the structural, organisational and cultural changes made within State Institutions, including my Department, were aimed at addressing\u00a0the\u00a0weaknesses\u00a0in our\u00a0financial system. Ireland has learned the importance of firm action to prevent financial crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also a full participant in the reform of financial regulation at the European level.  The stability of financial markets has been a central priority for the European Union since the financial crisis and in the interim we have seen the introduction\u00a0of\u00a0reformed oversight and resolution regimes to address any emerging vulnerabilities or instabilities in the European Banking Sector. <\/p>  <p>  These reformed oversight and resolution regimes include\u00a0new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.\u00a0 A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.\u00a0 To date the group has held seven meetings.<\/p>  <p>  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.\u00a0\u00a0To date work has been undertaken on\u00a0careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.\u00a0 Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as\u00a0the establishment of\u00a0a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. <\/p>  <p>  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.<\/p>  <p>  On the 26th January 2017, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. <\/p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.\u00a0 The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.\u00a0 The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was\u00a0begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p>  <p>  Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The attached table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016. As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. <\/p>  <p>  While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in\u00a0FET and the\u00a0numbers served on both a full and part time basis\u00a0are also included in the table.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.\u00a0 However the attached table on provision in the\u00a0higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of student \u00a0for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.\u00a0 The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Tourism\/Hotel\/Leisure\/Event <\/p>  <p>  Hospitality and Culinary<\/p>  <p>  Heritage and Cultural <\/p>  <p>  I also understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.\u00a0 However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0 Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and

While every effort is made to prevent error and the overpayment of grants, some overpayments will nevertheless occur.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where overpayments do occur, SUSI treats the overpayment as a debt to the exchequer and seeks to ensure that all such payments are recovered from the student.

I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p><p>Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward.<\/p><p>Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.<\/p><p>Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past. History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination. <\/p><p>I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the <i>Framework for Junior Cycle<\/i>the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which  over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.<\/p><p>The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.<\/p><p>In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. <\/p><p>The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.<\/p><p>This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of  history, news and current affairs too. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900067#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900067#WRF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[6464\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900067#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to accelerate the divestment of patronage of schools; if schools will be divested to the community national school model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[6465\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900067#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the mechanisms his Department will utilise in order to ascertain the wishes of local communities for the purposes of divestment of patronage; if the process will be open to all of the various patrons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced last week new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.

The schools are multi-denominational, and they allow for belief nurturing during the school day.  The Community National School (CNS) model was initially piloted in two schools.  Since then it has expanded with a total of eleven new Community National Schools, located in four ETB areas across the country (Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, Cork, Kildare and Wicklow, and Louth and Meath), being established in line with the patronage selection process operated by my Department.  Patronage of all the schools formally transferred from the Minister to the relevant ETB in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Community National Schools are multidenominational, and aim to accommodate parents who wish to have their children learn about different faiths and beliefs while at the same time nurturing children in their own beliefs. The schools do not prioritise any particular religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) curriculum is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools, and is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none.  Children learn together about the same themes and the schools communicate with parents so that families can talk at home about the different themes from their own faith and belief perspective.  The GMGY programme has evolved since the establishment of the schools, taking account of feedback from teachers, parents, pupils and faith and belief leaders. <\/p>  <p>  Parents can opt for their child to receive belief-specific teaching for a time during the school year and may request additional supports around specific rites of passage.  This approach is open to parents and pupils of all religions and beliefs and none.  The approach that a school takes to belief-specific teaching and rites of passage may be different in each Community National School, depending on the needs of the school community and the practices of local belief communities.  <\/p>  <p>  Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, which apply to all recognised schools, provide that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish.  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.  Each individual school determines the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as, for example, available space and supervision requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in November, includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of Community National Schools, like all other recognised schools, is subject to ongoing inspection and evaluation.  My Department's school inspectorate inspects the schools on an ongoing basis and this has included a Whole School Evaluation in certain cases.  The findings of such Whole School Evaluations are published on my Department's website.  In addition, the schools all engage in school self-evaluation, the findings of which are published on school websites. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900067#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900068#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[6469\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900068#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there is any mechanism by which leaving certificate applied students who wish to apply for membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be granted an interim indication of results in order that their applications may be assessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900068#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Religious Discrimination","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900068#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[6470\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900068#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there are any cases before the courts, equality tribunal, Workplace Relations Commission or other such body in which either his Department or education and training boards is or are the respondent and the complaint relates to discriminatory action or victimisation on grounds of religious belief; if so, the number of any such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that there are no\u00a0cases before the courts, equality tribunal, workplace relations commission or other such body in which my Department is the respondent in relation\u00a0to discriminatory action or victimisation on grounds of religious belief.<\/p>  <p>  The Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are separate, independent and autonomous bodies which are set up under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.

The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.

This analysis is vindicated by the fact that, in the first 6 months of 2016, local authorities nationally assisted more than 1,350 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies, with almost half of these going into social housing tenancies.  While final details are awaited, it is anticipated that housing authorities will have assisted 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness during 2016, a record level of exits, with a comparable figure of 2,300 in 2015.<\/p><p>Taking account of the Housing Agency's report, my predecessor decided not to renew the Ministerial Direction after 30 April 2016 and I do not propose to revisit the issue.

Accommodating family units in commercial hotel arrangements is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time. <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>fully recognises that the period of time that families spend in emergency hotel accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment that, by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.

Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices, where landlords are in breach of their obligations.

The social protection implications of the vote by the UK to leave the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  Social security is, clearly, one of the major issues as part of the Brexit process as it impacts on the daily lives of people.  My meeting with the Secretary of State was part of the wider engagement by Government with our fellow EU Member States including the UK.

These co-ordinating regulations do not harmonise the social security system of Member States but, rather, support free movement throughout the EU\/EEA by removing barriers to workers.  These arrangements will continue to apply and entitlements will remain unchanged until such time as the UK leaves the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also has a Bilateral Agreement with the UK on social security [S.I. No 701\/2007 &ndash; Convention on Social Security between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland].  This Agreement consolidated the terms of earlier agreements, modified them to take account of legislative changes in both countries and extended their scope to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. <\/p>  <p>  I emphasised to the Secretary of State that our long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights and, specifically in the context of the meeting, social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area (CTA), are safeguarded and maintained.

The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefited from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage also increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy combined with these Budget measures is likely to have supported a reduction in poverty since the period in 2015 to which the SILC publication refers.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%. Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 of 4% or almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and 6.9% or just over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.  <\/p>  <p>  Initial indicative data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016.  This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant and cannot be dismissed. <\/p>  <p>  We know that social transfers are very effective in reducing poverty and that Eurostat data shows that Ireland performs well in this regard.  But we also know that reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis. To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for activation.  This is a very significant step forward in addressing the poverty rates for these families.  Over 6,000 of those 9,000 lone parents have already been selected for activation and have been case managed, are scheduled for an engagement or are awaiting an appointment time.  The remaining 3,000 individuals have been fully case managed which means they have met with a case officer, have agreed a personal plan and are progressing with this plan which includes moving into education and training on foot of their engagement.<\/p>  <p>  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900070#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[6428\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900070#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the actions he will take in response to the survey on income and living conditions 2015 figures released recently, specifically regarding the working poor in view of the fact that over 100,000 persons are employed and living in poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>Eurostat data, based on the latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions for 2015, shows that Ireland has one of the lowest in-work poverty rates among the EU-28 member states.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years from that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemaker's scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension based on their means, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate, based on their household means. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.

I firmly believe that the Colombian peace process, which aims to create a virtuous circle between peacebuilding and respect for human rights, provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to discuss the peace process in Colombia with my EU colleagues and with the President of Colombia, Mr Juan Manuel Santos, at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 12 December.  The EU Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process, Mr Eamon Gilmore, also participated in our discussion.  I made clear the importance Ireland attaches to supporting the implementation of the peace agreement, and noted the need for all parties to the process to maintain momentum and to ensure that the citizens of Colombia begin to see evidence of a peace dividend.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia.  We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund, which aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement.

Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by the HEIs who instruct the CAO to make offers to candidates who meet the required criteria.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the places for undergraduate degree programme are currently set at 1,570.  This figure was considered to ensure that capacity factors including clinical placement requirements are available to each student on the programme.  Each placement requires supervisory, teaching and assessment support, all of which are resource intense.  It should also be noted that during the final year of the programme the student is paid 70% of the first point of the staff nurse salary scale for a period of 36 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Allocation of these places is made to both standard and mature applicants.  Standard applicants include those applying on the basis of leaving certificate results and QQI FET (FETAC) level 5 awards.  Mature applicants apply on the basis of being over 23 years and an assessment test.  Approximately 15% of places are allocated to mature applicants.<\/p>  <p>  It is the decision of the universities and colleges as to the quota of places made available to QQI FET applicants and not all courses will accept these applicants.  The overall quotas available for QQI FET applicants is limited - for example in 2016, there were 1,581 applications using QQI FET awards for approximately 98 places.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the budget for these degree programmes is held by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  During 2016, the Department wrote to the Minister of Education and Skills highlighting the current shortage of nurses in Ireland, especially psychiatric nurses.  The Department sought an increase in the number of undergraduate nursing places available in HEIs in the 2016\/2017 academic year in order to reduce the shortage of psychiatric nurses in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I wish to advise you that the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority agreed to increase the Psychiatric nursing places by 60 for the 2016\/2017 intake.  Workforce planning for replacement psychiatric nurses that are due to retire in the next few years is also currently under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900073#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900073#WRM01000"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[6405\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900073#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will fast track the approval of the new drug Orkambi for the treatment of cystic fibrosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information \/dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). <\/p>  <p>  In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act. Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: <\/p>  <p>1. the health needs of the public;<\/p>  <p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p>  <p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;<\/p>  <p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p>  <p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; <\/p>  <p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;<\/p>  <p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;<\/p>  <p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies);<\/p>  <p>9. and the resources available to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.

The granting of planning permission in April 2016 for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings was a huge and very welcome milestone for the project.  An internationally recognised design team, supported by an experienced National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and Project Team, are in place to drive the new children&rsquo;s hospital project and to ensure that the project is delivered in accordance with national policy to optimal design and value for money. <\/p><p>In relation to funding, the figure of &euro;650 million for the hospital relates to Exchequer funding that was approved in 2014 for the core construction of the new children's hospital together with the two Satellite Centres.  This funding was approved following a cost estimate that commenced in 2013 and which was completed in early 2014. At this time, construction inflation was estimated at 3%. <\/p><p>The tender process for the core construction elements for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Satellite Centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital has recently been completed.  The pricing proposed by the tenderers took account of construction inflation, which is now running at higher than 9%, the extended project timeline which is now scheduled to be completed in 2021, and the final market cost of the build. <\/p><p>Local and international companies participated in the tender process.  More than 35 people participated in review panels for the tenders.  The tenders were reviewed and measured against a number of technical and financial criteria and were independently peer-reviewed by construction experts with extensive experience of projects of this size and complexity.  I understand that it was a highly competitive process and following the conclusion, a company has been notified that it is the preferred bidder. <\/p><p>While there has been much media speculation about the cost of building this hospital, I am informed that the final proposed construction cost is actually within 5% of projections and the successful party was the one with the most competitive tender.  The Department is aware from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board that the tendered construction costs per bed as suggested in recent media commentary are not accurate and do not resemble the actual tender costs.<\/p><p>The construction tender does not include equipment which will be funded through annual operational expenditure or ICT costs.  These elements of the project were always to be funded and procured separately.  Funding for educational facilities and commercial elements such as retail and car parking were also separately identified from the core construction costs for the new children&rsquo;s hospital. <\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The Deputy will be aware that the new children&rsquo;s hospital and satellite centres programme is made up of three inter-related elements, the building, the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration.  It includes the change management needed in order for the three existing hospitals to become one and the actions required to ensure the smooth, safe and efficient transition to the satellite centres and new children&rsquo;s hospital.<\/font>Work is ongoing to finalise the heads of bill to merge the three existing children&rsquo;s hospitals into one entity to further facilitate this service integration. <\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  This complex programme of work is set out the Definitive Business Case for the new hospital which includes the capital, ICT and integration costs.

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines.  Under the Heath (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, biosimilars are not considered to be interchangeable, and therefore cannot be substituted for biological medicines.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that the use of biosimilar medicines will grow in Ireland in the coming years as the patents on biological medicines expire, offering opportunities for the State to make further savings on the cost of medicines.  The Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines 2016-2020 with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association includes a provision to take advantage of these new developments in the pharmaceutical industry.  Under the new Agreement the price of a biologic medicine will be reduced by 20% and an additional rebate of 12.5% provided upon entry into the market of a biosimilar.  <\/p>  <p>  This component of the Agreement was considered in detail by the State negotiating team.  The State team&rsquo;s view, which was confirmed by our international consultants, was that this provision strikes the appropriate balance between reducing the originator price and enticing new entrants into the market.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently assessing the whole area of biosimilar medicines and are developing a national biosimilar policy.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Low Pay Commission is the statutory body established under the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make an annual recommendation to the Minister.\u00a0 The Commission is tasked with ensuring that all recommendations are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its first report in July 2015.  Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1st January 2016. \u00a0The Commission&rsquo;s second report was submitted to Government in July 2016 and the recommendation made by the Commission for an increase to &euro;9.25\u00a0per hour was approved by Government in the context of Budget 2017.  The increase came into effect on\u00a01st January last.  The next review of the minimum wage is underway and the closing date for submissions to the Commission falls this week.<\/p>  <p>  The Living Wage\u00a0must be seen as a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0The Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  This is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy you will be aware of the existence of a number of other wage setting mechanisms that were legislated for in recent years to assist workers in sectors that were traditionally characterised as low paid.  Orders made under these provisions can set minimum rates that are higher than the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a revised framework for the making of Employment Regulation Orders.<\/p>  <p>  A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) discuss and agree proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector concerned.  When it reaches agreement on such proposals for terms and conditions, the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.\u00a0 If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration. <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals.  If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister.  If it is considered appropriate to do so, an Employment Regulation Order giving effect to such proposals will be made by the Minister.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are JLCs for the following sectors - Agriculture; Security; Retail Grocery and Allied Trades; Hairdressing; Contract Cleaning and Catering. <\/p>  <p>Two\u00a0Employment Regulation Orders relating to the\u00a0Security and Contract Cleaning Sectors\u00a0came into effect on October 1st 2015.  (An amended ERO for the Contract Cleaning Sector was made in October 2016).<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a mechanism whereby, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and\/or of worker, the Labour Court can initiate a review of pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of a class, type or group of workers in particular sector.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If deemed appropriate the Labour Court can make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter.  If satisfied that the process provided for in the\u00a02015 Act has been complied with by the Labour Court, the Minister will make a Sectoral Employment Order.  Where such an Order is made it will be binding across the sector to\u00a0which it relates, and will be enforceable via the Workplace Relations Commission. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act also provides for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer\u00a0or employers\u00a0and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises. \u00a0Such agreements, known as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), are legally\u00a0binding\u00a0on the\u00a0subscribing parties.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900079#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Relations Contracts Data","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900079#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[6541\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900079#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the level of expenditure by her Department or any organisations under the aegis of her Department for each of the years from 2005 to 2016, in tabular form, on photography, advertising, communications advice, public relations, website development, interview training and preparation, including details of the events, campaigns or policies to which this expenditure related, and the company or individual to whom such payments were made;

Further actions will be taken in 2017 to respond to the increased demand which reflects positive labour market tightening in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900080#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900080#WRT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[6642\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900080#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she expects Irish manufacturing and services industries to remain competitive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs is having a positive impact on employment in the economy, since the first Plan was launched in early 2012.

The certainty, predictability and clear signal that this sends to enterprise &ndash; including both Irish owned and foreign owned entities establishing and doing business from here - remains essential. <\/p>  <p>  The KDB, introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets.  The Government and I are satisfied that the Knowledge Development Box is benefitting and will continue to benefit the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies.  Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment. <\/p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative. Ireland&rsquo;s KDB effective rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. <\/p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 to allow small and medium sized companies to avail of the Knowledge Development Box is going to Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 14th and 15th February 2017.

This includes companies in incubation units right through to high-potential start-ups in all industry sectors once they are generating income resulting from research and development activities.  The scheme should serve to significantly boost Irish innovation and investment in research and development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900081#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900081#WRU00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900081#WRU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[6455\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020900081#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the provision which will be made for child care services not currently under the registration remit of Tusla to access the new single affordable child care scheme, for example standalone afterschool services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>Quality assurance will be an absolute prerequisite for participation in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.

The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  As with any scheme, there must be entry and cut off points.  These rules for ECCE reflect evidence based policy and are necessary from an administrative and budgetary management perspective. Regrettably, it is the nature of such rules that they benefit some more than others. <\/p><p>Providing free pre-school for children from the age of 3 was a key recommendation of the <i>Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy. <\/i>Expansion of ECCE was also given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach.<i><\/i><\/p><p>I would note that this summer we will come to the end of the first delivery cycle of the newly expanded ECCE programme.

The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  In the case of targeted subsidies, these will be payable for children from 6 months of age up to 15 years of age.
