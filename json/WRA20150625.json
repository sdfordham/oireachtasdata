I understand that this exclusion zone was placed at the request of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in order to mitigate against the potential risk to the island habitat from unauthorised coastal activity, landings and\/or intrusions. In this context the Department of Defence was contacted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht seeking support from the Naval Service and my Department agreed that a Naval Service vessel, acting in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role, would be deployed.   <\/p>  <p>  The vessel in question, the LE Samuel Beckett, was on scheduled sailing orders during this period. When on sailing orders, Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in that they are engaged in a range of activities, primarily involving fishery protection duties but also undertaking general maritime surveillance. Accordingly, as L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was on scheduled sailing orders, no additional costs were incurred by the Naval Service in respect of this tasking and accordingly no financial contribution was sought by my Department from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.   <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the Air Corps was not deployed as part of this operation, they did carry out one reconnaissance helicopter flight to Skellig Michael at the request of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that filming on Skellig Michael was a considerable boost to local businesses, with in the region of &euro;2 million being spent locally. The film employed 50 Irish crew and utilised a wide range of local service providers, including hotels and restaurants in the Cahirciveen region of west Kerry. I understand that Tourism Ireland are already receiving trade enquires from Tour Operators about opportunities to build itineraries around Star War locations in Ireland. I believe that the potential tourism value from this for Ireland ,   particularly given the proximity of the Wild Atlantic Way , is significant   and   I understand that Tourism Ireland is planning a campaign to convert the interest in Skellig Michael from the film&rsquo;s fans into increased visitors to Ireland in 2016 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500045#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500045#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[25088\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500045#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will commit to donating ten acres of the lands at Magee Barracks in County Kildare, or the value thereof, to the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>On 1 July 2003 the Government decided that Magee Barracks would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.

Following discussions at that time between the Department, Kildare County Council and the then Department of Environment, Heritage &amp;amp; Local Government, it was agreed that the entire site would be transferred to Kildare County Council in accordance with the terms of the Housing Initiative.

Consequently, any buyer will be obliged to comply with these provisions.

In the first 5 months of this year, the Department made payments of &euro;8.25 million to almost 3,600 employers in respect of 4,900 employees.  Two levels of payment are provided - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years &ndash; provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, the scheme has been expanded to include those transitioning into employment from the one-parent family payment scheme, and short-term unemployed young people under the Youth Guarantee.  <\/p>  <p>  A review of the pilot phase of JobsPlus, covering the first year of its operation (from July 2013 to June 2014), confirmed that the aim of putting in place an easily identifiable and user-friendly scheme targeted at employers had been achieved.  It also found that over 60% of jobseekers, more than 24 months on the live register, have benefitted from the initiative, contrary to expectations prior to the introduction of the initiative.  The review noted that the average level of subsidy paid at the end of June 2014 amounted to just under &euro;374 per employee per month and that the net benefit to the Exchequer from each employee maintained in employment was in excess of &euro;11,750 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  While the risk of distortion may occur in recruitment practices by employers, I am satisfied that JobsPlus has been useful in influencing employers to consider longer-term jobseekers over those more recently unemployed or moving employment.  In line with commitments made in the context of Pathways to Work, the Department recently looked at the first 18 months of operations of JobsPlus.  This confirmed that the findings from the earlier review remain valid.

Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. <\/p><p>The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. <\/p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. <\/p><p>While no commitment was received in relation to BTLs, it is accepted that additional competition will have the effect of reducing prices to consumers on all products, including mortgage interest rates for Principal Dwelling Houses and Buy-to-Let mortgages.  For example, lower rates are available for many standard variable mortgage customers if they switch lender.  The banks must be convinced that they are at risk of losing customers if they persist with SVRs that are higher than the rate their customers could get elsewhere.  People who are in a position to move their business to another bank should look into their options to do so.

The draft maps are currently available for inspection on the individual study websites via and members of the public may provide feedback on same.  The draft flood maps are for the purpose of consultation only and should not be used for any other purpose or decision making process.

Insurance Ireland members take this data into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.

Notwithstanding this, I have received assurances from Bord na gCon that at all times since March 2012 it has been solvent and operating within agreed bank facilities in relation to liquidity. It has also assured me that it has neither breached its approved bank borrowing limit of &euro;25m at any stage since March 2012, nor requested any increase to the agreed bank facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The deputy will be aware that I have provided an additional &euro;2.756 million to Bord na gCon in 2015 for the support of the greyhound sector.

The ten issues outlined in the Deputy's Parliamentary Question of 10 February 2015  formed the agenda for the policy element of my discussions with the group. Having carefully listened to their proposals on the issues raised at the meeting, I explained my views to them.<\/p>  <p>  Sentencing was the main issue discussed. I explained that the mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, as provided by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. I also explained that a sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any time. Currently a person sentenced to life is, on average, likely to spend 17-18 years in prison before receiving any extended period of temporary release.  This means that the imposition of multiple life sentences, whether concurrently or consecutively, in a case where more than one murder is committed in the same incident, does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no such effect in practice or in law. <\/p>  <p>  On the offence of manslaughter, this does not attract a mandatory sentence but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.  I explained that the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law and that an important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. I stated that I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a specific minimum term of imprisonment for murder or to replace the offence of manslaughter with offences of different degrees of murder.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of bail law, a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions because of the constitutional presumption in favour of bail which arises from the fact that, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restricts the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.   \t<\/p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage. Some revised provisions (adjusted to take account of the Attorney General's advice on the draft General Scheme) were sent to the Office of the Attorney General last month and a response is awaited.  Following consideration of these issues it is expected that Government approval for the General Scheme will then be sought and the General Scheme will be published.<\/p>  <p>  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in terms of parole and release, I can advise the Deputy that proposals are currently being prepared to establish a Parole Board on a statutory footing. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2014 I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy. As an initial step, the Government agreed in principle in November 2014 to proceed with the implementation of a number of key recommendations, including the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish a Parole Board on a statutory footing. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway on the preparation of a General Scheme and will be submitted to Government for consideration in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500054#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500054#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[25609\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500054#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding residency in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath;

Approximately 65,000 children are participating in this Programme in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of access to the free pre-school year for children with special needs was considered when the ECCE Programme was launched and a number of measures were introduced by my Department to make the Programme more accessible for these children. These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. <\/p>  <p>  This Government recognises however, that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within the ECCE Programme.<\/p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health have agreed to work together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. <\/p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883\/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. <\/p><p>Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad  under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.  For example, prior to the transposition of the Directive the HSE met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the new Directive.  The HSE has also participated in an EU Patients Forum conference which was held in Dublin in April to inform patient groups of the Directive.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Additionally, the HSE is at this time actively engaged with consultants representing two specific cohorts of patients to facilitate access to certain diagnostics and treatment for which there are long waiting lists in Ireland.  The HSE welcomes requests from Hospital Medical Boards to present and inform the doctors of the provision to refer patients to other EU\/EEA countries for healthcare under the terms of the Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500057#WRN02700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500057#WRN02800"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[25567\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500057#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that the number of intensive home care packages was almost two-thirds under target in April 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended. It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs. Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system. Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).<\/p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals. The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017. Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500058#WRO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Remuneration","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500058#WRO02050"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[25628\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500058#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Health Service Executive public sector workers in receipt of salaries within certain bands (details supplied).","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the matter.

One of those key reforms has been the introduction of generic drug substitution and reference pricing as provided for by The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The Act permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided that they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). Generic substitution is being introduced incrementally, with the HPRA prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest saving for patients and the State.  This process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  By the end of January 2015 the HSE had set reference prices for 110 interchangeable groups across 37 different medicines \/ combinations.  Reference pricing has generated over &euro;47 million in savings in 2014 and is expected to deliver a further &euro;25 million in 2015. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>  <p>  Another measure to promote the use of generic medicines is the work being undertaken by the HSE's Medicines Management Programme.  The programme actively engages with General Practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our wider Troika commitments a target for generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume was set at 70% by the end of 2016.

A DRG system has been operational in Irish hospitals for over 20 years with the AR-DRG grouping system used to group each hospital&rsquo;s inpatient and daycase workload into approximately 1,050 DRGs.  Until the end of 2013, the main use of the DRG system was to adjust the budget allocations of acute public hospitals by up to 3% in line with the complexity of their casemix and their relative performance under the Casemix System.  DRGs have also been used as a tool to assist with planning as well as monitoring and assessing performance within the acute hospital sector.<\/p>  <p>  Since January, 2014 the DRG system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF).  ABF is also referred to as Money Follows the Patient.  The new model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken. As such, hospitals will be funded based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients.  They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered through the use of fixed budgets for ABF activity.  <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the recently published &ldquo;ABF Implementation Plan&rdquo;, the new model is being rolled-out on a phased basis in public hospitals and full implementation will take a number of years.  January 2016 will be an important milestone in the process when block budgets for inpatient and daycase activity will be converted into ABF allocations for the first time.  It is intended that the payment system will extend over time to cover other hospital activity and eventually evolve so that money can follow the patient out of the hospital setting to primary care.  <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of ABF is an important step towards implementation of a commissioning or strategic purchasing model.  My Department has commenced the process of developing policy on a commissioning model in the Irish context that is aimed at improving the way the health system plans and arranges for the delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms are designed to introduce a greater level of efficiency to the health service, and create a specific link between spending and activity. They do not seek to reduce overall spending.  Instead, the changes provide a more transparent funding mechanism that rewards hospitals more fairly for activity. The experience of other jurisdictions that have implemented ABF suggests that the funding model can deliver improved performance in important measures of system efficiency such as significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.

The Report, <i>&quot;Economic Cost and Burden of Eye Diseases and Preventable Blindness in Ireland&quot;<\/i>, which was part of a pan-European study of 16 countries, looks closely at the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent eye disease and blindness.<\/p><p>The health service is addressing the prevention of eye disease and blindness across the broad range of health services including acute, primary and community based services.<\/p><p>Health service provision aimed at protecting people's eye health and, where necessary, providing supports to people with visual impairment, is based on the goals and principles of Healthy Ireland, rooted in primary care and integrated with and supported by secondary and specialist services for those who need them.  Eye care services are made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to children and to medical card holders and their dependants.  All pre-school children may avail of the child health examination route in order to be provided with any necessary optometric services.  Children of primary school age are usually screened twice during the primary school cycle and are referred for assessment and treatment if such is required.  Any refractive errors are treated and spectacles or other appropriate care is provided where necessary.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are seen by a HSE eye doctor when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than refractive error.  Outpatient services, i.e. non-routine examination and\/or treatment is provided for children in respect of defects noticed at child health or primary school examinations.<\/p><p>The HSE's National Clinical Programme on Diabetes, which includes care of children and adolescents with diabetes, was established in May 2010.  Diabetic retinopathy screening commenced in March 2013 and offers free, regular screening to children from age 12 to adults.  Systematic retinopathy screening on a population basis is both cost and clinically effective in identifying treatable eye disease.<\/p><p>The HSE has a Primary Care Eye Services Review Group, consisting of key stakeholders, in place to examine issues around primary care eye services including population needs and the adequacy of current services.  The Group will identify any current inadequacies and make recommendations as to how these should be addressed.  It will report later this year.<\/p><p>The HSE has put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently, in collaboration with acute hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These include maximising the use of capacity in public hospitals, through measures such as additional outpatient clinics and extending theatre hours, as well as outsourcing activity to private service providers through a public tendering process.  Ophthalmology services are included in the waiting lists to be addressed by such measures.  These are a key aspect of meeting the Minister for Health's commitment to reduce maximum permissible waiting times to 18 months by the end of June and 15 months by year end.<\/p><p>People with disabilities, including blind and visually-impaired people, can access specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  These may be provided directly by the HSE or in partnership with voluntary service providers such as the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to the provision and development of clinically effective and cost effective vision services and supports through prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes, all of which will contribute to addressing the priority goal of the World Health Organisation's Vision 2020 initiative, namely to eliminate avoidable blindness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500060#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500060#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[25669\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062500060#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the revenue that would be raised by introducing a sugar tax on sugary drinks, as proposed by the Irish Heart Foundation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>I have met the Irish Heart Foundation and am aware of their report.

As an immediate response to the Gaza crisis, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to help provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families many of whom had to flee their homes. <\/p>  <p>  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, which I attended last October, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards both urgent immediate needs as well as long term recovery efforts.  &euro;1 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal. A further &euro;500,000 will be provided to UN partners this year with the remaining &euro;1 million of the pledge to be disbursed in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The support provided to Gaza is in addition to our broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people which currently amounts to over &euro;10 million annually, and addresses immediate humanitarian needs, as well as development priorities, education and the promotion of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press, at EU level and elsewhere, to maintain focus on the humanitarian needs in Gaza and for an end to the blockade. The EU has consistently called for the opening of Gaza, and a broad change of Israeli policies there, most recently in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in November last. I made these points directly to the Israeli Foreign Minister during my visit to the region earlier this year.   Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have strongly advocated for a stronger EU involvement in the Peace Process. The Middle East Peace Process was discussed most recently at the May Foreign Affairs Council and HRVP Mogherini briefed Ministers on her recent visit to the region with EU Special Representative, Fernando Gentilini at this month&rsquo;s FAC. <\/p>  <p>  I endeavour to use all appropriate opportunities in my international engagements as Minister to press for progress in restarting peace talks in the region.
