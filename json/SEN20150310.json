I raise the matter of the amalgamation of three schools in Greenhills.  While the amalgamation is going ahead, I raise in particular the methodology of communication on how this arose in the first instance, which left a great deal to be desired.  The rules and procedures in place appear to be merely written down and are not to be observed.  The first that parents heard about this was a note in the schoolbag to say it was a done deal and that was the end of the story.  The first the Department of Education and Skills heard about it was at more or less the same time.<\/p> <p>Last year, I asked a question about this and the Department did not know anything about it.  The matter is in the prerogative of Archbishop's House in conjunction with the parish.  The communication came directly from the school via the schoolbags of the children, but that is not the methodology laid down for consultation.  Working in partnership in education we have parents, boards of management, school management, patrons and the Department.  They should all work together according to a procedure which is laid down.  This needs to be clarified in relation to how one goes about amalgamating schools, who is to be consulted and how such consultation is to take place.<\/p> <p>The parents contacted me and I knew as much about it as they did, which was nothing.  I had to bring all I could together into a meeting room to get some information.  I must say that when I contacted the Department of Education and Skills, it gave me any information it had.  When I contacted Archbishop's House the information then came forward, but it was not forthcoming before.  What worries the parents is that while the amalgamation is going ahead, the buildings, space, location and services have not been outlined or timelined.  In particular, it is a worry for parents whose children are on the autism spectrum as the ASD unit in St. Peter's national school will be amalgamated into St. Paul's national school.  When will they see the services and when will they see written confirmation that the services they have now will be maintained and enhanced?  They definitely do not want to go backwards and at least want to ensure the service and space goes with them.  I do not know where the sensory room in St. Peter's national school will go.<\/p> <p>When will we see detailed plans for the amalgamation arrangements?  There is an apparent lack of space at the moment and three into two will not go.  Just today, I received a separate communication from the Department to say there is some funding available for buildings.  Can the Minister outline what is there and when it is expected to be on the ground?  When two schools are being put together, it must be given priority.  It is not a new school, but will be the same over on another field and there will be less space.  I also ask the Minister to comment on the outdoor play space area.  What is left there and what is in the hands of the parish?  The parish owns a certain bit of land outside the school.  Is it possible to include that in the negotiation?  With concerns about obesity, outside play space is as important as inside play space, particularly for PE.  To have teachers juggling when they let children out because of space is not fair.  There is land there that should be used.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was part of the school but it is fenced off at the moment.

The new school is planned for next September but many parents are not happy that they have been given sufficient information about the accommodation, facilities, services, money and new buildings.

This transfer meant that the three primary schools in Greenhills parish were under diocesan responsibility and the patron deemed it an opportune time to review the provision of Catholic primary school education in the parish.  The patron's office subsequently commenced discussions with the boards of management of the three schools regarding the future requirements for Catholic primary education in Greenhills parish.  Following a number of meetings, agreement was reached with the three boards that there would be a junior and a senior co-educational school on the St. Paul's site.  Taking into account representations from the three boards that sufficient time would be allowed for the smooth transition, it was decided that the two new schools would commence operation in September 2015.<\/p> <p>The patron's office has confirmed that accommodation for the children in the ASD unit has been a major consideration in these negotiations.  While the junior school has such a unit, the senior school has also agreed to establish one following a request from the National Council for Special Education.  My Department has confirmed its willingness to provide grant aid to both schools to establish these units, which will also include sensory rooms.  My officials will continue to work closely with the schools to ensure this permanent accommodation is put in place.  In the meantime, the schools are undertaking conversion works to the toilet areas to facilitate the co-education arrangement from next September and my Department is providing grants to the schools for these works.<\/p> <p>The schools have decided that the introduction of co-education will be on a phased basis in the two new schools.  Co-education will commence with junior infants in September 2015 in the new junior school.  The current single sex classes will remain unchanged for the next number of years to allow the transition to take place.  These classes will be accommodated in either the new junior or the new senior school.  In some cases, there may be agreement with parents for other classes to become co-educational.  This is a matter for the school community to decide.  The two schools will be known as Holy Spirit junior primary school and Holy Spirit senior primary school.<\/p> <p>The mainstream staffing levels in the schools will comprise a principal and 12 mainstream classroom teachers in the junior school and a principal and 11 mainstream classroom teachers in the senior school as well as two special class teachers.  In addition, three amalgamation concessionary teaching posts will be approved between the two schools.  The resource teaching and English as an additional language, EAL, provision will remain at current levels, namely, the junior school will have 2.6 posts and the senior school will have 2.4 posts.  In June 2015, the patron intends appointing a single manager to oversee the transition and assist in establishing two new boards of management.<\/p> <p>I do not have specific information on the outside play area.  Perhaps I can revert to the Senator on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#C00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Seanad&oacute;ir s&aacute;sta?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#C00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta but more communication will be necessary on the ground with the schools and the parents.

As the Senator stated, NUI Galway has established a task force, chaired by Professor Jane Grimson, former Vice-Provost of Trinity College Dublin.  The task force will set out its full and detailed terms of reference after its first meeting in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The task force consists of a number of highly respected members from inside and external to the university, whom I consider well placed to advise the university on its policies, procedures and a range of initiatives to achieve gender equality in promotion.  NUI Galway has committed to the development of a range of gender equality initiatives through the international Athena SWAN programme, which I launched recently at the Department.  This has been a real force for change in other countries, and I hope to see it have similar positive effects for women working in higher education in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is actively considering how best to support the improvement of gender equality throughout the Irish higher education system and is developing a database of staff employed in the sector, so we can ensure gender equality becomes a reality at all levels in the academic profession in Ireland.  The data shows that in Ireland women represent 43% of academic staff in the universities and institutes of technology.  However, only 21% of professors and associate professors in Irish universities are female, and the national average is approximately 19%.  This problem is not unique to Ireland.  The European Commission's 2012 report, Gender in Research and Innovation, showed that throughout the EU member states women represented only 20% of professorial staff.  This problem is not unique to higher education; more broadly, gender inequality is reflected in purely economic terms in the differences in earnings between men and women throughout the world.  In this context, I am pleased to report that in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report 2014, Ireland was ranked 8th, above the US which was ranked 20th, and the UK which was ranked 26th.  I am not hugely proud of this but we are in a better place than some other countries.<\/p><p>In terms of higher education specifically, gender equality is well established in Irish legislation.  The HEA has a specific legislative role in \"promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education\".  The Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 require our higher education institutions to promote gender balance and equality of opportunity among students and staff, and to prepare and implement statements of policy in respect of equality, including gender equality, across all of their activities.  The HEA has a role in reviewing these policies.<\/p><p>Ireland's National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 emphasises the equal importance of the three core roles of higher education institutions, namely, teaching and learning, research, and engagement with wider society.  There have been a range of initiatives to address the under-representation of women in science, which has been a matter of growing concern among policy-makers internationally in recent years.  These initiatives provide a catalyst for affirmative action in respect of gender equality at institutional level.  I hope the Athena SWAN programme in particular will make a real change in higher education in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#D00200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>T&aacute; iontas orm go bhfuil an tAire ag r&aacute; go bhfuil s&iacute; s&aacute;sta leis an gcur chuige at&aacute; ag NUIG, fi&uacute; ar an mbunphointe nach bhfuil ionada&iacute; &oacute; aon cheann de na ceardchumainn a bhaineann leis an gceist seo - SIPTU, IFUT n&oacute; Aontas na Mac L&eacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn - ar an tascfh&oacute;rsa.

It is useful that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will come in and set out his and the Government's position and deal with our questions.  I welcome the fact there have been some discussions with union representatives from the Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, ambulance services.  I thank the Leader for arranging for this useful debate through which we can tease out the issues.  This is what the Seanad should be and is doing today.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to the House the week following the recess for a further debate on the airport staff pension issue.  The reason I call for this debate is that late last night the expert panel produced a further report which proposes that some additional funds be given to those long service deferred members who were in the daa.  While the amount proposed is small, I welcome the proposal as it shows some movement.  However, I would look for Aer Lingus to do likewise.  The report is quite detailed and while we are not under massive time pressure to deal with it, I suggest the week after the recess would be an appropriate time to deal with it.  The Minister has been good at coming to the House to address the issue and despite the fact I have not agreed with much of what he said, I give him credit for attending here.  A debate here would be useful and would encourage the Government to use its influence with Aer Lingus to ensure additional payments are made for the long service deferred members of Aer Lingus.  The daa members are only a small section and I am happy for them.  I met a group of daa workers yesterday on this issue.    <\/p> <p>I and my colleagues are disappointed and shocked that the Fennelly report into the resignation or retirement of the Garda Commissioner and other matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is indefinitely delayed.  I firmly believe the Taoiseach is using this report as cover so that he does not have to answer the questions put to him regarding what he said to the former Secretary General of the Department when he sent him out to the former Garda Commissioner to seek his resignation, or otherwise.  It seemed curious at the time, something I debated with the Taoiseach in this House, that the Government felt it was appropriate that the whole area of the Taoiseach's interaction with the former Garda Commissioner - something not allowed under the Constitution - was included in the Fennelly report.<\/p> <p>I suggested to the Taoiseach that day that we could remove a whole tranche or a third of the material to be covered by the Fennelly commission if the Taoiseach told us that day in the House what transpired, because he is the only one who knows that.  Now we learn that the Fennelly report is indefinitely delayed.  Therefore, while the Taoiseach has answered questions put by Mr. Justice Fennelly, we do not know what his answers were.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We do not know whether the Taoiseach inappropriately contacted the Garda Commissioner and sought his resignation, which he is not entitled to do.

He could clear this up today.

It was a very successful campaign and a large number of people turned out from various organisations and NGOs, all of whom combined under the Yes Equality banner.  It is ten and half weeks until the referendum on 22 May.  The launch was a very positive sign of a very strong and, I hope, successful &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  However, it is important, as the organisers stressed, that the campaign not be dominated by political parties, although it is very welcome that they support it.  While all political parties are supporting the referendum, it was important to see civil society groups represented so strongly yesterday.

The debate might best take place in this House once the review of the Insolvency Service of Ireland has been completed.  I understand it is near completion and that the Government will be announcing new measures in April, with a focus on ensuring the safeguarding of the family home.  Everyone here is very concerned about newspaper reports about increasing numbers of repossession proceedings being launched, albeit that the number of repossession orders granted has happily been small.  The overall number of people whose mortgage accounts are in arrears is declining but, that said, there is no doubt that the take-up of the insolvency service has been disappointing.  It is important that Government policy now focus on those individuals whose mortgages are in arrears for more than two years.  We must also focus on the retention of the family home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#P00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The terrible news we heard this morning about an elderly couple in their 80s in Churchtown suspected to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning is a real reminder to us of the job we have here.

The then Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, stated he would take steps in that direction in regard to new homes or homes that had been revamped.  On that basis, I withdrew my Bill.  The proposed measure was to be introduced on 1 September, and I hope it was.  The tragedy is a real reminder to us of our responsibility and it is not the first.

Even if there are some who have difficulty facing up to their problems and engaging with lenders, having court proceedings hanging over them indefinitely may well have the effect of making them retreat more or causing even further distress.  I agree with colleagues that what is needed is a review of the insolvency legislation as suggested by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at the weekend.  While the legislation was an advance, the banks are obviously not playing ball.  Whatever about sub-prime lenders, the pillar banks were propped up to the tune of billions of euro by the taxpayer and while nobody is suggesting that people can go on living in a home without paying a penny of what is owed, there has to be a middle ground where people can retain their family home, if only for their lifetime, and make a contribution towards their debts.

It related to the suicide of a person.  The \"where\" is irrelevant, but it is largely believed that this person took their life because of bullying in the workplace.  We hear so much about bullying in schools and we forget that bullying in the workplace is now at epidemic levels in the country.  Paragraph 5 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 describes bullying.  There is  a huge difference between robust management and bullying in the workplace.  We hear of people taking their own lives.  I have looked into the eyes of the cowardly bully who usually takes on the strongest people among the staff with a view to breaking them down because if they are broken down, the staff are broken down.  <\/p> <p>There is within the criminal justice system the legislation entitled Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  I believe that where bullying in the workplace takes place, we are not talking about children.  We are talking about adults who set out deliberately to destroy an individual.  I am calling for a debate here with the Minister for Justice and Equality, at the Leader's earliest convenience, to allow us to discuss bullying and how it is destroying workplaces.  We have statistics that indicate that in the United Kingdom up to 50% of employees are victims of bullying in the workplace.  I am not saying that this is a top-down problem.  Bullying in the workplace can be peer to peer or bottom up or top down.

The issue is not just prevalent in the workplace and is still very much prevalent in schools.  We should embrace the ISPCC's approach which makes tackling bullying the responsibility of all of us rather than saying it is the responsibility of schools, parents, etc.  All of us must tackle bullying and we all need to see how we can work with the organisation.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Bacik's call to repeal reasonable chastisement.  In Ireland, at the moment, we allow for reasonable chastisement not just by parents of children but for people who mind up to three children.  On the floor of this House I have advised the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, that I had an amendment on the matter.  I sent it to him a few months ago and I believe he has sent it to the Office of the Attorney General for examination.  My proposal is simple to implement.  I ask Senators to think about this matter.  Sometimes we evoke childhood memories and declare such chastisement did us no harm.  Would Senators allow us to have a debate asking if it was okay to hit a fellow Senator?  I suggest we would not have such a debate and yet we say it is okay to hit somebody who is smaller than us and who has no power.  We say that is okay but I think it is very much not okay and Ireland needs to step into line.

We have the HSE and other people that can provide advice to schools, plus we have the Stop Out-of-Control Drinking campaign.  The drinks industry has no role to play in public health.

One of my proposals is that legislation should be introduced to prevent banks from using family homes as collateral for commercial loans.  That is one area we need to look at.  We also need to look at the area of long-term letting.  If one is renting a commercial premises in the private sector, one can get a 20 year lease with five-year rent reviews.  Why can we not look at that in the case of family homes?  Why must we have the current structure?  While there have been some changes over the last 20 years, there has been no fundamental change.  If one buys one's own home and can pay one's mortgage, one has security of tenure.  If one goes into a local authority house, one can stay on for life as long as one pays one's rent and does not run into major difficulty with that local authority.  However, if renting in the private sector one is left going from six-month period to six-month period.<\/p> <p>We now have landlords trying to raise rents when they are not entitled to do so.

I have been a consistent critic of the insolvency legislation, particularly the provisions in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, that bestow on the banks an effective veto on personal insolvency arrangements.<\/p> <p>The statistics show that since it was established in 2013, the Insolvency Service of Ireland has concluded just 199 agreements to allow people to deal with their debts.

Property prices have increased and now the banks are pushing through repossessions with zeal.  There are 80 cases before the county registrar in the Galway Circuit Court.  Where are the public interest directors on the boards of the banks?  Are these individuals not in place to ensure that the public interest - in terms of keeping people in their homes - is represented?  Of the thousands of people who account for the 7,101 bills for repossession to which I refer, very few own mansions in Dalkey or are the subject of media headlines.

The reports that emerged after the property crash pointed to groupthink and a lack of open criticism of Government policy as a basis for the property bubble.  I am struck by the groupthink in the political establishment at this time in regard to the forthcoming referendum.  I am struck by the way people champion the presence of politicians at yesterday's launch of the Yes Equality campaign, for example, when we all know that there are probably as many politicians in this House opposed to the proposal as there are in favour of it but who simply dare not to speak out.  One sees a small chink in the consensus when one hears a person such as the distinguished Labour Party representative Deputy Willie Penrose saying it is best to leave this issue to people to decide for themselves and observing that he knows a family where two people are on one side of the argument and two on the other.  Where are the politicians to represent the vast number in the country who have serious reservations about the impact of what is proposed on the right of children to be brought into the world or brought up by a father and a mother?  On the whole business of smacking children, what is at issue is a defence of reasonable chastisement, that is, that parents can offer such a defence in a court case.  It is not that people have a right to punish their children physically but a question of having such a defence in place.  I do not know whether that defence should change.  I can see the arguments in favour of taking it away, but I would be far more impressed with the so-called advocates of children's rights if they abandoned their dereliction of duty around children's right to be brought into the world or brought up by a father and a mother.  Their silence on the issue or, worse than silence, their abandonment of support for children's right to a father and a mother reflects no credit on them.  This is a far more important and relevant issue in the life of every child than the discussion around smacking.  I wish the people concerned would abandon the groupthink and begin to reflect what a lot of people regard as common sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#U00300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I was delighted to hear about the Sober St. Patrick's Day initiative, which will see the Gresham Hotel come alive with ceoil agus craic on 17 March in an alcohol-free setting.

Our national day has been hijacked to a large extent by alcohol consumption, with excessive drinking perceived as virtually a patriotic duty.  The Sober St. Patrick's Day movement has already been introduced in six cities in the United States and in Belfast, proving that one does not need to have a drink to have fun on our national holiday.  Ireland should lead the charge in encouraging initiatives such as this.  I have highlighted on numerous occasions in this House the alarming growth of binge drinking and the subsequent rise in, for instance, in the incidence of liver disease in people as young as 20 years.  Last week I pointed to instances of children, some as young as 11 years of age, being admitted to Temple Street hospital with alcohol poisoning.  It is no exaggeration to say the Irish character seems to adhere to a particular caricature around St. Patrick's Day.

There have been attempts to have a proper national debate on alcohol consumption and abuse in this country, but it has not been treated with sufficient seriousness.  It is a discussion that must be put firmly back on the agenda and driven by the Government and health promotion agencies rather than, directly or indirectly, by the drinks companies.

As of now, the Irish team, as I will describe it, has won four races at Cheltenham.  Willie Mullins has won four races in an unprecedented achievement.  Ireland has outstanding trainers, owners and jockeys and the industry's success shows that the fair support and assistance given by every Government over the past 20 or 30 years to the Irish racing industry has worked, has produced the jobs and has beefed up the industry.  It has given Ireland a world-leading reputation in horse racing and long may that continue.  In general, there is cross-party support for the modest financial incentives the racing industry gets.  Were every industry, of the many that receive financial support, to plough back the same level of jobs and results as does the racing industry, everyone would be proud.  However, I simply wish to congratulate all those involved in what has been a tremendous showcase day for Ireland at Cheltenham.  There are three more days to go and hopefully there will be more success because it is not just about the glory of Cheltenham but is about the jobs in rural Ireland in the training yards, on the stud farms and among the small breeders.  It is phenomenally successful and has arisen not by accident but through proper planning and support.

This had a particular resonance for me because in the early years of this particular Seanad, similar specific allegations were made about Roscommon hospital and at the time, it appeared as though those allegations were being used in defence of a policy of changing the status of that hospital.  Subsequently, Members found out that the figures upon which those assertions were made were incorrect.<\/p> <p>There appears to be a strategy of selectively leaking some as yet unsubstantiated figures to the press, which sometimes seems to resonate with certain policies that are being advocated by some of the folks who run the health service.  I do not refer to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in this regard but more to the longer-standing administrative policies.  It is important that the air now be cleared and that Members find out precisely what was the basis for the figures, what methodology was used and what is the true position.<\/p> <p>It now transpires that in the case of the event in Roscommon several years ago, what was happening was that junior doctors were writing heart attack as a cause of death on death certificates because ultimately, that is what everybody dies from at some stage.  One could argue that the last thing that occurs to people while they are alive is their heart stops beating but these deaths were going into the record as heart attacks and in that situation, a heart-attack of course would have a rather high mortality rate and this tended to distort the figures.  Moreover, it was not gelling with the figures being produced by Dr. Paddy McHugh's unit for patients who were admitted to cardiac care in Roscommon and who were found to have heart attacks.<\/p> <p>The HSE subsequently stated the figures and assertions were incorrect and it has been a long-standing bone of contention of mine but I believe an apology must be made to Dr. Paddy McHugh and his staff in Roscommon hospital, about whom it was suggested there was an untowardly high incidence of fatal outcomes associated with cardiac events, which was not true.  In the future, however, it is of critical importance to have disclosure.  What was the basis for these figures, what methodologies were employed and can the health authority stand over the methodologies?  Moreover, if they are true, what corrective action is being taken?<\/p> <p>I note in passing that the waiting list figures are not getting better and the great open sore in Irish health care is still gaping wide.  It is not specifically the fault of the present Government any more than it was of its predecessor but it certainly should send a message that something very different must be done.  We have had such waiting lists in times of booms and busts, in recessions and depressions, as well as in times of high and low public spending.

It would be useful for the rest of us if we knew exactly who was being put under pressure and at what level.  The United States Chamber of Commerce has engaged in this.

Unfortunately, at this late stage, she still has not intervened.  Will the Leader send a message to her that this dispute in the north west is not of the making of the 60 lecturers in question?  It is unnecessary and I am sure Labour Party Members and those from the north west will agree with me that in the transfer of responsibility from St. Angela's College in Sligo, the only NUI constituent college north of a line from Dublin to Galway, to NUI Galway we must ensure the status of the lecturers is equal to that of those lecturing within NUI Galway.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marc MacSharry:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While the authorities in NUI Galway have not done so to date, and they do not recognise the status of the TUI, I appeal to the Minister, through the Leader, to direct them to engage with the organised labour movement in the form of the TUI because not to do is to strip the lecturing staff of the college of their rightful representation in negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#X01000","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien called for a debate after the recess with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on Aer Lingus pensions.

The Government will announce a new set of measures in April designed to focus on the still unacceptably large number of families in long-term mortgage arrears who now face repossession of their homes.  The number of mortgages accounts in arrears is now declining.  While just over 110,000 accounts were in arrears at the end of quarter four of 2014, this represented a decline of 6.4% compared to quarter three of 2014, and a decline of more than 26,000 accounts over the course of 2014.

At the end of 2014, there were almost 760,000 private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwellings.  Almost 650,000 of these accounts, or 85%, were not in arrears.  The number of accounts over 90 days in arrears continues to fall, and it has now fallen for five consecutive quarters.  It is regrettable that there was a small increase in the number of accounts in arrears of more than 720 days but the increase of 294 was the lowest increase in that category recorded to date.  People can use figures however they wish but they are the facts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, we are not seeing the same progress in the most difficult cases, namely, those in arrears for more than two years.  Far too many mortgage arrears cases have ended up before the courts when they should have been resolved through earlier engagement between borrowers and their banks.  Most cases could be resolved by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  It is right to expect the proportion of debt deals being accepted by creditors to increase.<\/p><p>We will debate the review when it is published.  The Government is committed to acting on it.  We recognise that some adjustments to the personal insolvency framework may be necessary to address this matter, for example, debt distressed families' awareness of the Insolvency Service, independent audits of the quality of the debt deals being recommended by personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, the options available to borrowers where insolvency arrangements have been rejected by creditors and the supports that are available to families that cannot pay even restructured mortgages or meet the requirements of insolvency arrangements.  A great deal of work is being done.  I hope that, when the review is published in April, we can hold a further debate on it.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to the deaths of two people because of carbon monoxide poisoning.  They are regrettable, particularly given the fact that, as the Senator mentioned, detectors are on sale at a low price.  The issue must be highlighted.  While it is being addressed in the case of new homes, the public needs to be vigilant.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton discussed insolvency laws.  I have dealt with that matter.<\/p><p>Senators Craughwell and MacSharry mentioned the difficulties being experienced at St. Angela's College in Sligo.  Perhaps they could be updated by the Minister by tabling a Commencement matter.<\/p><p>Senators Craughwell, Eamonn Coghlan and others referred to bullying in the workplace.  There is also bullying on social media.  It is a major problem.  The Senators asked that the matter be examined under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.  The Minister attended the House on this issue previously, but we will try to arrange for him to attend again.  There is dreadful bullying, and not only in the workplace.  It is hurting many young people on social media and causing severe consequences.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden discussed mortgage arrears.  I have dealt with that matter.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout mentioned the defence of reasonable chastisement.  I note her points in that regard.  She also stated that drinks companies should not have a role in public health.  As she pointed out, the joint committee will address that matter.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson complimented the Government on acting quickly to plug the loophole in the Misuse of Drugs Act relating to head shops.  In the previous Seanad, Senator Wilson and other Members played an important role in ending head shops and the products they supplied.  The Senator is well capable of and qualified to speak on the issue because of his input during the previous Seanad.<\/p><p>I note Senator Paul Coghlan's points on the Fennelly report.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett welcomed the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel.  The idea came from this House.  As he stated, reopening the tunnel is a proper use of public expenditure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senators Kelly and Leyden raised the issue of the prison officers' dispute.  We should all acknowledge the work being done by everyone in the prison system and the many reforms that have been carried out in recent times.  The driving force behind the progress made to date has been the constructive engagement and consultation between the management and the Prison Officers' Association on all aspects of the reform process under the joint task reviews as has been agreed under the Croke Park agreement.  That positive and constructive engagement and consultation is required again and I hope all parties will sit down and resolve this issue.  It should not go unnoticed that the prison officers are doing a wonderful job in very difficult circumstances.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen dealt with the need to tweak insolvency laws and give greater protection to the family home.  That is what the Government is attempting to do and we will have a debate in the House when the review is complete.  Senator Mullen also urged parties in Northern Ireland to come together and solve the problems which have arisen recently in respect of budgets.  I am sure they will get together and do what is necessary.  Senator Burke highlighted the need to examine long-term letting of properties and family homes in particular.  I am sure that will all come under the review and we can have a debate in the House at that time.  <\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan addressed the tragic accident in Argentina and the deaths of ten French people, including Olympians.  We would all like to express our condolences to the families involved.  The Senator also lauded the charitable foundation of Graeme McDowell, the golfer, and congratulated Mark English on his silver medal and the support given to him by the Irish Sports Council.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins spoke on the insolvency service and we will certainly have ample time to discuss the referendum and the points he made on it in the first week we come back.  Senator Noone highlighted \"sober day\" and the St. Patrick's Day movement, which is certainly welcome.  We wish the movement well in its effort.  Senator Bradford congratulated the Irish people involved in the four winners to date at Cheltenham and commented on the many thousands of jobs involved in that industry.<\/p><p>Senator Crown addressed the selected leaking of some reports and the need for disclosure of the basis for the figures that were leaked.  I agree with him and will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  The Senator also makes a good point about a public registry for people lobbying on behalf of the tobacco industry.  I will also bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.  <\/p><p>I have dealt with Senator Leyden's remarks on the prison officers and Senator MacSharry's remarks on St. Angela's College.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#Y00600","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That a debate with the Taoiseach on his role and the role of the former Secretaries General of the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the circumstances which led to the resignation of former Garda Commissioner Callinan be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#AA00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that the issue of the Dublin fire brigade ambulance is important.

Historically, the Dublin ambulance service has been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade under fire services legislation.  Statutory responsibility for this service, therefore, rests with Dublin City Council and consequently comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.<\/p> <p>That being said, I am a huge supporter of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and its crew who provide an excellent service for the people of Dublin.  Our paramedic fire fighters have a very long and proud tradition in the city and have rightly won a place in the hearts of Dubliners for that reason.<\/p> <p>Response times are good.  Training is excellent and clinical audits have been carried out for years.  As my constituency is very well served by Blanchardstown fire station in Coolmine, I am well aware of the valuable services that Dublin Fire Brigade ambulances provide.  Long may that continue and develop.<\/p> <p>The National Ambulance Service is part of the HSE and statutory responsibility lies within the remit of my Department.  In recent years staff at every level have put in a huge effort to transform the service.  The service has evolved from being simply a transport service to a paramedic service, where advanced and often lifesaving treatment is provided at the scene and in the ambulance long before the patient gets to hospital.  This is true throughout the country.  A major programme of reform and modernisation of the service has been under way for some time and will continue this year.  Response times for emergency Echo and Delta calls are improving, as are hospital turnaround times.  I pay tribute to the staff and leadership of the service for these major advances in recent years.<\/p> <p>Following the recent agreement between Dublin City Council and the HSE on changes in ambulance services, I want to be very clear that there is no question of any takeover by the National Ambulance Service of Dublin Fire Brigade.  Dublin Fire Brigade will continue to provide ambulance services in Dublin, using its own vehicles and staff, and Dublin Fire Brigade vehicles will continue to support ambulance services, as needed.  Only the structures around clinical governance of the service and call management will change.  I have previously stated and I am happy to repeat today that I will not support a single fire brigade ambulance being taken out of service.  However, the fact is that HIQA has identified serious patient safety concerns about the lack of co-ordination between the National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade.  In its recent report HIQA highlighted the urgent need to address these issues.  It is now proposed to establish a single point of contact and dispatch for all ambulance resources in the Dublin area and clinical governance of all Dublin ambulance services will be the responsibility of the National Ambulance Service medical director, Dr. Cathal O'Donnell.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These changes will mean that emergency calls in the future will go to one call centre in Dublin and not two.  The dispatcher in that centre will be able to see every available ambulance in the region.  The nearest available ambulance, whether it is a National Ambulance Service ambulance or a Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance, will be sent to the incident, which is not currently the case.  The people of Dublin can therefore look forward to a more responsive service as the nearest ambulance to the scene will be dispatched.  The changes will also mean that there will be uniform clinical standards, training, equipment and procedures, so patients will receive exactly the same level of care no matter which type of ambulance arrives.  These reforms make sense and are good for Dubliners.<\/p><p>There has to be a better system than the current one.  Currently, if Dublin Fire Brigade has no ambulance available, the call may, or may not, be transferred to the National Ambulance Service.  Passing calls between two centres poses potential difficulties and calls can be delayed or fall between the two services.  A patient can fall between two stools.  This has to change.<\/p><p>I know that firemen may be concerned about the future but they need not be.  Dublin Fire Brigade will continue to provide emergency ambulance services in Dublin and the staff will be fully consulted before any changes are implemented.  I understand that on Friday last, it was agreed to set up a joint Dublin City Council-union group, under an independent Chairman, to move the process forward.  This is welcome and I am sure the House will support it.<\/p><p>Dublin Fire Brigade has provided very well for the emergency needs of Dublin since 1898.  However, no service can afford to stand still.  A single contact and dispatch point for emergency ambulance calls is needed to address the safety issues identified by HIQA.  I ask this House to set aside any sectoral interests and to put the people of Dublin first.  Members should ask themselves what is best for the people of Dublin.  In my view, clearly what is best for Dublin is an integrated call-taking and dispatch service.<\/p><p>I am therefore pleased that following meetings between Dublin City Council and the unions, agreement in principle has now been reached on the integration of emergency ambulance call taking and dispatch.  It has also been agreed that Dublin Fire Brigade will continue to be fully involved in emergency ambulance service delivery and there will be no diminution in such services.  I very much welcome this development which will ensure that the people of Dublin get an even better ambulance service in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#CC00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senators Averil Power and Mary White.  I thank the Minister for coming into this House.  We are restricted in the time we can speak on this issue.  I raised this matter last week and I know that the Minister is personally supportive of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service, as am I.  There are a number of stations in my area of Swords-Skerries-Balbriggan.  We all know the role of the Dublin Fire Brigade, its training and the fact that every crew member is a paramedic and many of them are advanced paramedics.  We all know the work these crew members do.  I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides as a supporter of the fire brigade.  My concern about these changes relate to whoever may be the next health Minister or environment Minister.<\/p> <p>I have a couple of questions for the Minister.  At the moment, the HSE pays Dublin Fire Brigade approximately &euro;9.2 million towards the emergency ambulance service for Dublin city and most of the county, including north County Dublin where I reside.  This is from an annual budget of approximately &euro;138.5 million.  It represents just under 6.7% of the overall HSE budget for ambulance calls.  However, over 40% of the calls go through the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service.  It therefore provides serious value for money.  This is my view.  I am not sure and I am not convinced that when it goes under the control of the HSE that we will get the same service or value for money.  This is my worry.<\/p> <p>I will conclude on these remarks.  After the recess, I hope the Minister will have more time to discuss this issue because I am very restricted in time today.  I am pleased that a mechanism is now being set up between the Dublin Fire Brigade representatives, the unions, and Dublin City Council.  However, I worry when people say there will be no diminution.  I agree the Minister is saying this will be the case and I am glad of that.  However, this does not change anything which happens in the future.  If anything, we should be expanding what is done in Dublin with the fire brigade across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#DD00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#DD00300","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1425997800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>We should be examining the possibility of a combined emergency medical services, EMS, system.

I came to the House last Tuesday and asked the Leader to schedule a debate on this issue because I was deeply concerned to hear the city manager had gone ahead and announced a major change to the service without the consultation that was promised initially.  Like Senator O'Brien, I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides as a Dubliner and someone who is aware of the service Dublin Fire Brigade provides and I know he does not want to see an ambulance taken out of service.  However, I share the same fears that this could be the start of cutbacks to the service.<\/p> <p>I have seen television documentaries about the HSE service and the response times around the country.  We get a far better service in Dublin.  Our response times are much better because the fire brigade is involved.  Given the management by the HSE of other areas, I am very concerned to see a working service being brought under the ambit of the HSE.  I also saw internal HSE documents last year that indicated this was all about cost-cutting.  That makes me worried for the future of the service.  I echo Senator O'Brien's comments in that I would appreciate it if the Minister could make time available in his schedule at the earliest opportunity to come in and have a full debate on this vital service.  It is one of our most basic services, to be able to respond to medical emergencies.

It is important that we debate this issue and that we refer to the recommendations of the HIQA report and act on them.  The recommendation set out that the National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade must both address the operational inefficiencies identified and publish a joint action plan outlining proposed steps to improve individual and collective performance in call handling, address verification, dispatch, ambulance deployment, mobilisation, navigation and the co-ordination of calls between services.  Another recommendation was that \"[a]s a matter of urgency, both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade must put the necessary corporate and clinical governance arrangements in place to provide a fully integrated ambulance service in the greater Dublin area.  This should include a binding service level agreement, which includes formal quality and performance assurance reporting mechanisms\".  It was also recommended that \"[t]he Health Service Executive and National Ambulance Service must immediately involve Dublin Fire Brigade in the National Ambulance Service Control Centre Reconfiguration Project to ensure a seamless and safe transition of services in Dublin\".  This is about providing a service that is not only efficient but also safe.  The changes that have occurred are about getting everyone to work together.<\/p> <p>Everyone here will join me in paying tribute to those who work in the ambulance service, both from the fire brigade side and in the National Ambulance Service.  They are all committed to providing a comprehensive service.  This co-ordination is necessary to make sure that we have the efficiencies that are required.  The HIQA report clearly identifies that there were two different systems in place.  The computer system was not the same and the whole process was different for both organisations.  That is why this reconfiguration must occur.  There has been a great deal of change over the past three to four years in the ambulance service across the country.  There has been a great deal of improvement, which must continue.  It now transpires that 70% of ambulances were released and able to respond to other calls within 30 minutes of arriving at the hospital and 94% within 60 minutes.  It just shows that change has occurred and efficiencies are in place.  This reorganisation is very necessary, but there must be full consultation and co-operation by all sides and every process that is required to get that co-operation must be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031000002#EE00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1425997800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
