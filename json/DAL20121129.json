The results of his research are stark and frightening.  They suggest patient safety is being compromised and give the lie to the notion that front-line services are being protected.  One finding is that comparative staffing levels are significantly lower than in the United Kingdom.  For example, there are six fewer staff in 25-bed surgical wards here and 3.5 fewer staff in medical wards, 13.5 fewer staff in AAUs and 3.25 fewer staff in wards providing elderly care.  I do not know if the T\u00e1naiste is aware that last week a report was published by the relevant authority in the United Kingdom which indicated that in 25% of units in the United Kingdom, which are significantly better staffed than ours, nurse staffing ratios were below minimum safety standards, which resulted in hundreds of premature mortalities.  The T\u00e1naiste will be aware that the Government proposes to reduce staffing levels in the health service by 3,700 during the next 12 months and by 3,700 the following year.  Taking all of this into account, what assurance can he give to the people that the Government is maintaining a safe health service for those forced to use it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900003#A00400","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1354185000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health will examine the results of the INMO study when published.  Without the full details of how the work was undertaken and the findings, it is not possible to comment in detail on the study at this point.  I am aware that other studies have cited figures which suggest Ireland has a more favourable nurse to patient ratio than in the United Kingdom.  The Government has determined, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, that health sector employment numbers must be reduced substantially in 2013 and 2014.  Spending on health services will also have to be tightly controlled.  The cumulative impact of staff reductions this year and in previous years presents a significant challenge to the health system in delivering services.  The priority is to reform the way health services are delivered to ensure a safe, more productive and cost effective health system.  Effective service delivery requires processes to ensure there will be sufficient staff, with the right skills, diversity and flexibility at the right time to provide high quality care.  <\/p><p>  Skills mix is a central factor in staffing decisions.  The Croke Park agreement has been crucial to the ability of the health service to manage in the difficult circumstances of recent years.  The flexibility and adaptability shown by staff, including nursing staff, have meant that even with reduced numbers, service levels have largely been maintained, while performance in relation to emergency departments and hospital waiting lists has been markedly improved.  In the grace period earlier this year the focus of the Minister for Health and health service management was on ensuring all critical and essential services were maintained.  This was successfully achieved through measures that included the reorganisation of resources, more flexible working arrangements and the filling of a limited number of critical posts.  The continuing reduction in staffing increases the need for reform, including greater flexibility in work practices and rostering and redeployment.  The HSE is committed to fast-tracking innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources, including by providing for greater flexibiliy in work practices and rostering, especially of nursing and medical staff, and the changing of the skills mix.  Further flexibility and efficiency measures are provided for in an updated health service action plan which has recently been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900003#A00500","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1354185000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The T\u00e1naiste appears to dismiss out of hand the results of this research, even before he has studied it.

The covered banks have continued to make progress overall under the financial measures programme - the rigorous analysis of the capital and liquidity requirements of the domestic banks presented in March 2011 - and advanced in terms of recapitalisation, asset deleveraging, deposit inflows and restructuring plans.  The recapitalisation of the PCAR banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland and the PTSB - and the IBRC has been successfully completed.  According to the survey of European banks carried out by the European Banking Authority published late last year, the Irish banks more than met the minimum standard set down for core tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%.  Deleveraging has progressed well so far and total covered bank deleveraging of about &#8364;63 billion had been achieved up until the end of September this year.  Further significant disposals have also been targeted for completion by the end of the current quarter of 2012 as part of the pillar banks' planned run-down of non-core balances.  With respect to funding, the banks' positions have improved significantly.  Deposits in AIB, Bank of Ireland and the PTSB have stabilised, with a gain in net inflows achieved since last year; international debt markets have opened up to the Irish banks; and reliance on ECB funding sources is down on previous levels.  As part of the EU-IMF programme, the Irish authorities had submitted revised restructuring plans for all of the participating institutions by the end of September this year.  On a related and supportive level, market sentiment towards Ireland as a sovereign borrower has improved considerably and this has been assisted by the re-entry of the NTMA into the bond auction markets, the fall in Irish Government bond yields, from 7.34% last May to 4.47% yesterday, and the prospect of a future agreement on breaking the link between bank debt and sovereign debt.<\/p><p>Against this background, as I have outlined, we have been looking in recent months at the future of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  In reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance on 4 October it was mentioned,<i> inter alia<\/i>, that an <i>ad hoc<\/i> working group chaired by the Department of Finance and involving both the Central Bank and the NTMA was looking to develop a strategy to exit the scheme, consistent with preserving financial stability.<\/p><p>In the context of the subsequent recent visit of the troika partners and the eighth review of the programme, it was agreed that such a strategy would be finalised by year end.  The early indications from this strategy are that a withdrawal of the scheme could occur in the first quarter of 2013.  However, I can assure the House and give reassurance to depositors that the Minister for Finance will give sufficient notice in advance of the withdrawal of the scheme.<\/p><p>I do not want to pre-empt what that strategy will recommend but I am very much conscious of the negative effect that the payment of fees by the participating institutions, in return for the guarantee, is having on those banks' profitability.  Furthermore, I am aware that the banks themselves are anxious to continue to move away from the cover of the guarantee as soon as is practicable.  From the perspective of the Government also, and the contingent liability on the State that results from the scheme, I consider its removal would be seen by the markets as a further positive step with respect to re-establishing Ireland's borrowing credentials.<\/p><p>In the meantime, however, while the details of winding down the scheme in the near future are being worked out, it is necessary to address the prolongation of the scheme.  In the normal course, the scheme would expire after 31 December 2012 if steps were not taken to extend it beyond that date.  Expiry would mean that new deposits made, or debt issued, from 1 January next year would not be covered by the guarantee, although of course liabilities incurred up until that time would continue to be guaranteed until their maturity.  It is in this context that the extension of the ELG scheme needs to be considered and I would like to turn to the motion before the House to approve the draft statutory instrument entitled the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2012.<\/p><p>As the House is aware, the ELG scheme, which was introduced in December 2009, provides a Government guarantee in respect of certain liabilities of a number of Irish credit institutions.  As I have referred to already, and because of its nature, the scheme is time-limited so any prolongation requires that the scheme be amended periodically.  This must be done by bringing a motion before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 - the CIFS Act.<\/p><p>The Statutory Instrument before the House, therefore, contains two amendments to the Schedule of the scheme which relate to its extension in time.  The opportunity is also being taken to include a third amendment, which is essentially a drafting or technical one.  I will deal with these amendments in the order in which they appear in the draft statutory instrument.  Item 1 updates a cross-reference which appears in the list of definitions set out in Article 3 of the Credit Institutions (ELG) Scheme 2009.  This clarifies that a financial support order means an order under section 6(4A) of the CIFS Act 2008 rather than under section 6(3B), a change that resulted from amendments to the Act made by section 74 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.<\/p><p>Item 2 amends paragraph 3.1(<i>b<\/i>) of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the period within which institutions may apply to join it.  This amendment seeks to extend the application period by replacing 31 December 2012 with 31 December 2013.<\/p><p>Item 3 amends paragraph 11.1(<i>c<\/i>)(ii) of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the time-related criteria which a liability must meet to be considered eligible.  This amendment seeks to replace the current end date of 31 December 2012, by which eligible liabilities must be incurred if they are to be guaranteed, with a proposed new date in national law of 31 December 2013.<\/p><p>The amendments are, in both cases, &quot;subject to the continuing approval of the European Commission&quot;.  This role for the Commission arises because, under state aid rules, all banking guarantee schemes require an assessment - every six months - of the case for their continuation.  It follows, therefore, that, if approved, such schemes can only be prolonged for a maximum period of six months at a time.  Consequently, the ELG scheme would remain subject to biannual Commission approval, notwithstanding the proposed one-year extension in national law, which is essentially a practical step to avoid having to legislate on a too frequent basis.<\/p><p>The necessary approval for prolongation has already been sought from the Commission and is expected to be formally given shortly.  Once given, this would mean explicit EU approval for the scheme until 30 June 2013, that is, for the six months from the end of 2012, in line with existing practice.  If, and only if, extension beyond this period were required, would further state aid approval be sought.  In addition to obtaining the approval of the European Commission as I mentioned, it is necessary to consult with the ECB: this process is already underway and the bank's opinion awaited.  For reasons of good administrative practice and timeliness, it has been necessary to proceed on this basis in advance of the formal consideration of the motion before the House, in line with the procedure on previous occasions.<\/p><p>As is also the normal practice, before deciding to notify the Commission of our wish to seek prolongation of the scheme, the views of the other relevant Irish authorities, the Central Bank and the NTMA, which are part of the usual starting point in any assessment of the future of the scheme, were sought and they were supportive of its extension.  I shall return to this matter later.<\/p><p>At this point however, it might be helpful to go into some detail on the scheme itself and set out the background to, and reasons for, its proposed continuation.  As I mentioned earlier, the scheme commenced in December 2009.  It succeeded the CIFS scheme, although both schemes over-lapped for a time until the expiry of the earlier scheme on 29 September 2010.  The scheme has been extended three times already, from its original end date of 29 September 2010 to the end of that year; subsequently, to 31 December 2011; and, on the last occasion, to the end of the current year.<\/p><p>The ELG scheme was designed to be more focused in application than its predecessor and to cover both a narrower range and smaller amount of liabilities.  The ELG scheme covers eligible liabilities as defined in paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the scheme.  These liabilities can be summarised as consisting of certain deposits and various unsecured debt securities.  Because eligible deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 are already covered under another scheme - the deposit guarantee scheme - the ELG scheme only covers the balances, where they exist, above this threshold.  Deposits which do not qualify for deposit guarantee scheme coverage in the first instance but are nevertheless eligible under the ELG scheme, for example, corporate deposits, are covered by the latter scheme alone.<\/p><p>The credit institutions which avail of the guarantee provided under the ELG scheme are described as the &quot;participating institutions&quot;.  Essentially, there are four main ones, apart from their subsidiaries.  The four are AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and the IBRC or Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  Among the best-known subsidiaries are EBS and ICS Building Society.  The full list can be viewed on the NTMA website.  The participating institutions in the scheme may take deposits and issue debt, with a maximum maturity date of five years, during the so-called issuance period which runs from the date the institutions joined the scheme to the end-date of the scheme, currently 31 December 2012.<\/p><p>Compared with liabilities of &#8364;375 billion at the beginning of the CIFS scheme in 2008, eligible liabilities outstanding under the ELG scheme at end-September this year stood at &#8364;78 billion, which represents a major reduction in coverage.  Over the course of 2012 itself, liabilities have fallen by about &#8364;25 billion, down from the &#8364;102 billion that was outstanding when the scheme was last discussed in the House.<\/p><p>The decrease in liabilities under guarantee during 2012 has been due to a number of factors.  First, the subsidiaries of the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, in the UK have been reducing their participation in the scheme since March last by not taking on new deposits under guarantee.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance facilitated this move by issuing a series of notices under paragraph 13 of the schedule to the ELG scheme, whereby he is empowered to limit the applicability of the guarantee to different categories of deposit.  In this way it was possible to restrict the guarantee to that category of deposits existing up to - but not after - a given date in the case of the UK institutions concerned.  The outcome is that deposits under guarantee have fallen by approximately &#8364;11 billion to date in these entities, but without any significant accompanying loss to the institutions of the deposits concerned.  In other words, the deposits were successfully retained even in the absence of the guarantee.<\/p><p>A second reason for the fall in liabilities covered during 2012 is that bank debt that has been maturing this year has not been replaced.  This accounted for approximately &#8364;6 billion of the reduction in liabilities.  A third, albeit more modest, factor has been the uptake of unguaranteed deposits which in turn displaced an equivalent amount of guaranteed deposits to a total of almost &#8364;1 billion.  This positive move stems from the original request - also made in accordance with paragraph 13 of the schedule to the ELG scheme - from the participating institutions to be allowed to offer unguaranteed deposits to certain corporate and institutional customers.  Again, the Minister for Finance facilitated this request by allowing such offers to be made, subject to certain conditions.  This move may now be seen, in retrospect, as being a small but significant first step towards removing the necessity for the maintenance of the guarantee in the first place.<\/p><p>I previously mentioned two specific amendments to the scheme before the House that are necessary to extend the scheme in law.  For the further information of the House, however, I wish to mention in passing that there are also two amending orders of a consequential, technical nature which will have to be made if the statutory instrument amending the scheme is passed by this House.  These are called financial support orders and will be made in exercise of the powers that are conferred on the Minister for Finance under section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  These orders do not have to be brought before the House as they are not part of the proposed amendment to the scheme but are supplementary to it.  I have set out what the two orders are in my speech for the information of colleagues.<\/p><p>I believe that we are in a much stronger position than we were a year ago but, notwithstanding that, I am bringing this statutory instrument before the House today.  We are very near to bringing closure to the guarantee narrative.  There have been similar guarantee schemes internationally, including in Europe - for example, in Finland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden - and these have all been successfully ended when the time was judged right.  For Ireland, this time is close.  We want to continue our return to more normal banking conditions under which, <i>inter alia<\/i>, a guarantee should not be necessary.  To facilitate this move, it is proposed that we provide for prolongation of the ELG scheme into 2013 with the intention that this will be the last time we will have to discuss such a motion in the House.<\/p><p>I wish to make a final point, one which is often not fully comprehended when the ELG scheme is being discussed.  The vast majority of bank, building society and credit union depositors are not affected by the existence of the ELG scheme at all.  Most account holders, excluding the corporate sector, in the participating institutions are covered by the deposit guarantee scheme only, operated by the Central Bank of Ireland, which guarantees qualifying deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 per depositor per institution.  This is the standard form of guarantee scheme in the majority of EU member states.<\/p><p>I began by setting out the improvements in the banks' capital, deposit and funding positions.  All of these improvements point to a normalisation of our banking system.  The removal of the guarantee will be a further reinforcement of this return to normal operations.  I again assure the House that the vast majority of depositors will continue to benefit from the deposit guarantee scheme.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900007#E04000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354188600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion, which in essence is to extend the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 for a period of 12 months, up to the end of December 2013.  That is subject to continuing EU state aid approval.  It is important to state that at the outset.<\/p><p>  The current guarantee expires on 31 December 2012.  We are talking about extending the scheme only for new deposits made in 2013.  Existing deposits are guaranteed by the scheme until their maturity date.  As the Minister of State indicated, we are talking about deposits of more than \u20ac100,000.  It must be said, in the week before the budget, that if one has less than \u20ac100,000 in one\u2019s account in a bank, post office, credit union or State savings bank, or with An Post or Postbank, they are guaranteed by the Central Bank.  One need not have any fear in that regard.  When people hear the issue being discussed in the D\u00e1il they often get worried, especially older people.  We want to reassure them in that regard.<\/p><p>  The order will extend the liabilities scheme for a further year, subject to the approval of the European Commission.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, recently indicated that, if possible, he would like the covered institutions to stop using the guarantee scheme in early 2013.  He was more specific than the Minister on the matter.  That is his target and he has stated it on the record.  He said the income from the guarantee was not accounted for in Ireland\u2019s medium-term fiscal projections published earlier this month.  The Department is saying that there is an income of \u20ac1 billion and that it will have a budgetary implication.  It is important with regard to the memorandum of understanding, meeting our fiscal targets by 2015 and working our way out of the IMF programme at the end of next year.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance was categoric in saying that the continued guarantee is not accounted for - in other words, he presumes it will no longer be in place.  The Department did not build it into its medium-term fiscal projections which the Minister for Finance published recently.  That must be said.  The scheme is on its way out and the Government does not expect it to continue into the future.  It is important that this is taken into account.  While there is a loss of income, this is already factored into the Government\u2019s medium-term fiscal projections.<\/p><p>  Currently the scheme costs the banks approximately \u20ac1 billion, which does have an impact on their profitability.  Both Bank of Ireland and AIB have deposits in the United Kingdom not covered by the scheme and at the end of September approximately \u20ac78 billion was guaranteed, with \u20ac56 billion of that by way of deposits and the balance of \u20ac22 billion by way of guaranteed bonds.  The amount covered has fallen since the original guarantee was introduced in 2008, as shown in the schedules.  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland recently issued covered bonds, backed by loans to customers, which were unguaranteed.  That suggests the banks are almost ready to fund themselves without the aid of the guarantee.  The majority of deposits guaranteed are now in this country as the main banks' UK deposits are not guaranteed.  Even if the ELG scheme was not renewed, deposits in Irish banks of up to \u20ac100,000 would be protected.<\/p><p>  The main banks joined the ELG scheme on 4 and 11 January 2010, while the EBS joined on 1 February 2010.  Irish Life &amp; Permanent, Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society, Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank, Allied Irish Banks plc, Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited, EBS and Irish Nationwide are all covered under the guarantee scheme, although some of them have changed their formats and their names.  In addition, a number of subsidiaries are covered.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have time to reply on the matter but I would welcome the sending of a note to me and to the spokespersons in this regard.  I understand that when the scheme came into operation in 2010, Irish Permanent (IOM) and Bank of Ireland (IOM) became involved in the scheme.  Bank of Ireland (UK) plc joined the scheme in July 2010.  AIB Group (UK) plc is involved in the scheme, while AIB (CI) limited joined the scheme in 2010.<\/p><p>Does \"CI\" stand for the Cayman Islands?  I do not know, but would be delighted to hear it does not.  The Minister of State might tell me what AIB (CI) is.

I knew it was an island somewhere, so that was my suggestion.  Anglo Irish Bank Corporation International plc and Irish Nationwide are also included in the scheme.  The Minister of State might indicate whether some of those subsidiaries are involved.  He stated that with the Government's prompting, as well as on their own behalf, the banks are looking to their bottom line and want to reduce their participation in this scheme.  This applies particularly to the subsidiaries and deposits in the UK.  The Minister of State might provide a note as to how much of the deposits and bonds not based in Ireland are covered by the scheme we are passing today.<\/p><p>The amount of money paid by the financial institutions under the scheme to date has been phenomenal.  Total fees received to the end of September were &#8364;3.597 billion.  It is important to say, in regard to restructuring our banks, that under this heading alone the banks have contributed that amount of almost &#8364;4 billion back to the Exchequer already, with the balance to come in by the end of the year.  A brief breakdown can be shown under two headings -  the current eligible liability guarantee scheme, which replaced the original credit institutions financial support scheme.  Combining the two schemes, Irish Life and Permanent has paid &#8364;442 million, Bank of Ireland &#8364;1.264 billion, AIB &#8364;1.254 billion, IBRC &#8364;444 million, Irish Nationwide &#8364;33 million and EBS &#8364;152 million.<\/p><p>We are talking today about the eligible liability guarantee scheme but what intrigues me is that the income received under the original scheme has effectively expired because all the institutions have migrated to the new scheme.  I note that in the course of 2011 Anglo Irish Bank was paid &#8364;750 million.  The Minister of State might inform us whether that has been washed out of the system, or if there is any more to come.  That bank still seems to have accounts some under the old scheme, although I accept the figures apply to last year.<\/p><p>The Secretary General of the Department of Finance stated that the banks would eventually be weaned off the scheme but the guarantees would remain in place for deposits and bonds that have not yet matured.  Some of these will mature next year or in the coming years.  I understand the maximum period involved is five years so in theory it could take up to five years for the scheme to wind down fully.  The Minister of State might give us an estimate, based on current levels, of how much is expected to be received each year from 2012 to 2015.  We cannot predict how much will come in during 2013, but it is known that &#8364;78 billion is in the system so we should be able to calculate how much that will generate in the coming four years.<\/p><p>Is there a system whereby the banks could buy themselves out of the current guarantee?  For example, Bank of Ireland, which seems to be our strongest bank, issued &#8364;1 billion of three-year unguaranteed cover bonds last week, the first time an Irish bank has tapped into the markets in more than two years.  If that bank is in a position to replace some of the guaranteed bonds by its own unguaranteed bonds, raised on the markets as a result of its improving position, and wants to rid itself of this cost affecting its bottom line, can it buy out the guarantee?  Is there a mechanism whereby it can exit the guarantee scheme in regard to current deposits, buying out the Exchequer in that way?  Mr. John Moran stated it is Government policy to wean the banks from the eligible liability guarantee scheme in the first quarter of next year, so we are very close to that date.<\/p><p>Professor Philip Lane of the international macro-economics department in Trinity College observed that the removal of the guarantee would not impact on Irish deposits because the evidence throughout Europe shows there is no risk to depositors in the event of a bank collapse.  That is the underlying assumption at EU level.  In the first place, the EU will not allow a bank to collapse so there will be no such collapse in Ireland, given that we have signed up to the ESM and all such arrangements.  From that point of view there is no serious threat, and I believe it will be possible for the banks to exit the guarantee scheme very quickly.<\/p><p>It is very important to mention that when the first figures were reported, a total of &#8364;375 billion was applied to all the banks covered on the night of the guarantee.  The document does not outline the assets of the banks at that time but that was one of the reasons the Government was allowed to provide the guarantee.  It was controversial, however, and we could talk about it forever and a day.  The Labour Party Members who are now in government opposed the scheme all the way although they made a remarkable somersault when they supported the guarantee last year.  I am sure they will do the same this year.  We are used to the Labour Party making political somersaults - the people can see that happening.  The longer that party stays in government the more the people will understand that Labour will say anything in opposition and then do the exact opposite in Government.  It is not good for politics that the Labour Party acts like that but that is its choice.  The people will adjudicate on that in due course.<\/p><p>When the guarantee was introduced the assets in the Irish banks were considerably more than &#8364;500 billion.  Their assets were always over and above the value of their liabilities under the guarantee.  Notwithstanding the &#8364;64 billion we have had to write off the bank balance sheets since then, there were always more than enough in assets to cover the amount issued under the guarantee on that night several years ago.  It was widely criticised and we are all curious to know why it was necessary.  The people of Ireland and the Government were not told the truth by the banks.  I do not claim the banks deliberately misled anybody; my belief is they did not understand how badly off their institutions were and considered they had a liquidity problem.  It has taken a long time for some of them to come to realise the level of the write-downs that were necessary.  That realisation was forced upon them.  The transfer of their loans to NAMA helped to crystallise it.<\/p><p>In his final remarks, the Minister of State spoke about improvements and the reduction in the guarantee, noting: <blockquote>All these improvements point to a normalisation of our banking system.  The removal of the guarantee will be a further reinforcement of this return to normal operations.<\/blockquote>I do not accept the good faith of the Irish banks but I accept the good faith of the Minister of State and his Department in stating that.  I doubt if there is anybody who accepts the good faith of the Irish banks in regard to such claims.  They have to be sat on,  watched and stamped upon to make them do their business.  When the banks mention &quot;normalisation&quot; they refer only to the normalisation of their profits, their capital reserves and their ratios.  The function of a bank is to lend money, charge for it and make a profit, but these banks are not lending money to small and medium-sized businesses or to individuals.  People with excellent credit ratings cannot get car loans; people in small businesses cannot get loans and those who want to start up a business must make an application to their local enterprise board because they will not get a loan.  In spite of all the official statistics that appear, we all know that the local bank manager will regularly tell his customers not to bother putting in a loan application because he knows it will not succeed.  The official statistics on loan approval may show one thing but they do not reflect the level of inquiries or the applications people would like to make if they thought they might get a fair hearing.  We know about the difference between the figures for loan approvals and those for actual draw-downs.  Banks describe loan restructuring as new loans but that is a sham in some cases.  Some banks stand by their good customers and will give them additional finance but generally the loan situation is very difficult.<\/p><p>I would like to see normalisation of bank lending, not of the old bank profits or financial ratios.  It is good to know, in the last quarter of the current year, that in regard to what we are guaranteeing today, 72% is customer deposits with only 1% being interbank deposits.  The balance of 28% is bank debt.  The banks have been streamlined, their balance sheets have been made smaller and they are becoming more fit for purpose but they need to be kicked even more than before because they are not lending to the Irish consumer.  I would like to have confirmation that at this stage we are not guaranteeing any deposits outside the State or in any bank subsidiaries similarly outside.<\/p><p>My party will support this scheme because it must be put in place.  I look forward to the entire scheme being wound down naturally, and as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900010#H00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354189800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>This is the third occasion on which the Government has sought to extend the operating period relating to the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme.  In June 2011, under the secrecy of a Cabinet meeting, it extended the scheme by six months.  Then, last December, the Minister for Finance came before the House and sought a 12-month extension.  On both occasions, I said that the Government had no exit strategy in respect of the guarantee within the timeframe set down under the scheme.  While both Bank of Ireland and AIB have started to return to the international money markets, there is still no sign that the Government has succeeded in its strategy for exiting the guarantee.   It is clear that it has failed in its attempts in this regard.  Not only are Fine Gael and the Labour Party continuing to accept the liabilities of the existing scheme; they have gone further and are insisting that the banks should continue to pay out in respect of unsecured and unguaranteed bonds that are not even covered by the scheme.  The fact that the Minister of State is before the House to seek a further 12-month extension proves beyond any doubt that the Government has again failed to release the State from the grip of the guarantee.<\/p><p>  As of the end of September, the total amount guaranteed under the current scheme was \u20ac78 billion.  What the Government wants to do now is to reopen the guarantee after 31 December and allow banks to place new liabilities on the State and its taxpayers.  How times have changed.  When Fianna F\u00e1il sought to introduce this scheme in December 2009, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party spoke out against the proposal.  The Labour Party's Deputy Burton and Fine Gael's Deputy Bruton were both highly critical of the proposal.  Deputy Burton opposed the extent of the liabilities being placed on taxpayers' shoulders and Deputy Bruton demanded that the banks should demonstrate that they had changed their errant ways before being given any further public moneys.  Nine months later, when Fianna F\u00e1il sought to extend the scheme, Fine Gael and the Labour Party - along with Sinn F\u00e9in - rightly rallied against the guarantee.  Deputy Burton said it was yet more evidence of the failure of the then Government's banking strategy and informed the House that the Labour Party &quot;does not write blank cheques&quot;.  The Minister of State, along with the Minister for Finance, voted against the extension on the grounds that the then Anglo Irish Bank continued to be covered by the scheme.  Yet here we are again.  The former Anglo Irish Bank continues to be covered by the scheme, senior banking executives continue to receive pay and pension packages in the hundreds of thousands of euro and small and medium-sized businesses continue to be starved of credit.<\/p><p>  All of the arguments used by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to oppose the ELG scheme while in opposition are just as valid today.  The only difference is that the Minister of State now sits where Brian Cowen and the late Brian Lenihan previously sat.  Like so many of its other broken promises, the Government has swallowed lock, stock and barrel the failed policies of that which preceded it.  The motion before the House is proof, if more proof were needed, that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are now enthusiastic supporters of the failed banking policy of Fianna F\u00e1il despite having opposed it only two years ago.  Today, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and her Labour Party colleagues will write another blank cheque for the banks, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will support the inclusion of the former Anglo Irish Bank's toxic debts in the extended scheme, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will agree to potentially take on more bank liabilities despite the banks' ongoing failure to lend to new businesses and Fine Gael and the Labour Party will do exactly what Fianna F\u00e1il did in December 2009 and September 2010.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State will be well aware of reports in this morning's newspapers to the effect that the number of families facing difficulties making ends meet has more than doubled in the past four years.  The latest Growing Up in Ireland survey of 7,400 children and their families shows that 61% are struggling now, compared to a figure of 29% just four years ago.  People across the State are gripped by fear as they wait to see what additional hardship the Government is going to impose on low- and middle-income families in next week's budget.  Yet here we are once again throwing a lifeline to failed banks such as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, which continue to cost the State billions of euro every single year.  People want to know why there is one rule for the banks and another for struggling families.  Why there is unlimited funding for bailing out the banks yet so little for investment in jobs?  Why is there no action on the excessive pay and pensions of top bankers when struggling families are being hit with extra taxes and charges?  Why has no attempt been made to use the guarantee in order to secure real reductions in payments to bankers or real increases in lending to small and medium-sized enterprises?<\/p><p>  The bank guarantee is not just bad policy; it is a symbol of all that is wrong with the financial and economic strategy begun by Fianna F\u00e1il and continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  What does it say about our Government that it is willing to guarantee the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro but that it did not for one second think to provide a guarantee for citizens in order to shield them from the social and economic crisis created, in the first instance, by the reckless behaviour of the banks?  The guarantee represents the great inequality at the heart of Government policy.  The basis of that inequality is that the banks must be saved at all costs and the people must pay the price.  This is the meaning of the word &quot;austerity&quot;.   The latter is the policy that protects financial institutions and their senior management while imposing the full burden of the economic crisis on ordinary people.<\/p><p>  In my home county of Donegal last week we once again witnessed the human face of the burden to which I refer.  An emergency call was made for an ambulance to attend to a young child who was unconscious.  The ambulance was dispatched with only one advanced paramedic on board and that individual was driving the vehicle.  At the scene, the paramedic made the clinical decision, based on the needs of the unconscious child, to travel back to the hospital.  As the paramedic was the only staff member on duty at the time, the boy had to be transported to hospital in the back of his mother's car with the paramedic tending to him there.  When I sought clarification from the HSE on this matter, it was confirmed that the advanced paramedic was working on his own from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the evening in question.  The HSE had failed to provide cover in order to ensure there would be two paramedics on duty at the time.  When the paramedic to whom I refer was on site, I understand he requested that the HSE allow one of two paramedics who live a number of a number of doors away from the unconscious child's home to assist him.  This request was refused, all in the name of trying to keep costs down.  This is the very real effect of Fine Gael's and the Labour Party's policy of austerity on our public services.<\/p><p>  When the Government bails out banks to the tune of \u20ac21.4 billion, as it did last year, and then makes the State potentially liable for billions more through the extension of the guarantee scheme, it is making a very clear choice.  It is choosing to follow the lead of Fianna F\u00e1il.  It is choosing austerity over recovery and banks and bankers over ordinary people.  Let me be clear: Sinn F\u00e9in will be opposing the motion before the House.  It was a bad policy in 2009 and 2010, when Sinn F\u00e9in, the Labour Party and Fine Gael voted against it, and it remains a bad policy today.  The only thing that has changed is that Deputies Miche\u00e1l Martin, Michael McGrath and the others in Fianna F\u00e1il are no longer running our economy and society into the ground.  That job is now being ably done by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900011#J00100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1354189800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett, who is sharing time with Deputy Ross.

Whatever qualifications they may have put on it, when it came to it, just like the European political establishment, they prioritised the interests of the very institutions, speculators and financiers who had caused the crisis.  They rushed in to provide an emergency guarantee to these gangsters, frankly, who had caused the crisis.<\/p><p> The Government is claiming success in that we are moving towards the winding down of this guarantee.  It claims this is being enabled because the banks are now able to access money on the international markets.  Whatever small bit of stability might be returning to the famous markets, the Government should not count its chickens on that stability being retained over the medium to long term, particularly considering the net effect of the policy of bailing out the banks and paying for it with an austerity that is crippling economic growth across Europe.  At some point the markets will recognise the significant contradiction.  I would confidently, but regretfully, predict that the panic will return at some point when the extremely damaging downward spiral caused as a result of the austerity measures imposed on the European economy, begins to kick in and to make its way into the core of the European economy.  This is beginning to happen.  Even in so far as the Government is claiming success in its efforts to move towards the winding down of this guarantee, we should remember that this so-called success has only been made possible because these banks have been stuffed with the cash of ordinary people.  The previous Government and this Government, under the diktat of the ECB, said that they would do whatever is necessary to protect the banks; it is their top priority.  Everything will revolve around restoring the banks to so-called normality, bringing them back to profitability, bringing them back to where they were before the crisis began.  I find this to be a bizarre aspiration, that we are going to nurse them back to the situation they were in before all this mess started and that we think that is the recipe for sustainable economic and financial development over the long term.  This shows a complete failure to understand what caused the crisis in the first place.  It is not just a case of studying past history because we will be counting the cost when the crisis hits again, as it surely will.<\/p><p> The cost being paid by Irish citizens for returning the banks to so-called normality is the \u20ac64 billion we have had to borrow - for which we will be paying interest for many years to come - in order to stuff these banks with cash and restore the confidence of the all powerful markets.  The cost is an unsustainable debt burden taken off the backs of the private banks, the for-profit banks, and unloaded onto the backs of the Irish people.  If people are made suffer to the extent that we are making them suffer, the banks will be nursed back to health but at what cost for ordinary people.  It is a cost we will be counting for decades, possibly.  We are counting this cost now because of an unsustainable debt burden.  The cost next year will be \u20ac9.1 billion in debt interest.  The spectre of the deficit is constantly raised by the Government.  We are warned that the deficit is \u20ac15 billion which we must cover.  We are told that anyone who criticises the Government's policies is living in Cloud Cuckoo land.  I ask the Government please to state the qualification that \u20ac9 billion of that deficit is in debt interest-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900011#J00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354190400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett wants us to default.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900012#K00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354190400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Yes.

They refuse to lend to small and medium enterprises and they refuse to put the mountains of cash we have given them back into the economy to create jobs.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to the sharp contrast between the behaviour of the banks we bailed out to this extent and the offer of the credit unions to use their assets to finance job creation programmes, social schemes and so on.  They are pleading with the Government to use their assets to help the economy but the banks, which have been stuffed with our cash and which we own, refuse to do so.  That is the contrast between the two.<\/p><p>  We will not support the extension of this guarantee.  Over the next three or so years, we will be paying off the bondholders at a rate of \u20ac17.4 billion in 2013, \u20ac6 billion in 2014 and \u20ac11 billion in 2015.  If we were to assert control over these banks, which we own, and if we were to default on these bondholders, that money could be used for the stimulus programme needed to create jobs, economic growth, the protection of the vulnerable and the development of the economic and industrial infrastructure of the country.  Why not do this instead of continuing with this insane protection of the financiers and banking system that caused the crisis?  The Government is allowing them to walk off into the sunset after we have bailed them out and paid this terrible price.  They will walk off into the sunset, be again privatised and return to making profits, while we are left holding the can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900012#K00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1354190400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>There might be some sort of a case for an extension of this guarantee if the Government were prepared to take responsibility for the banks and were prepared to direct their operations.  There might be some sort of a case for saying the banks need to attract further funds, that they are too fragile at the moment to be allowed depend upon the bond markets and that the Government should decide what the banks should do with the money on deposit.  However, the banks are in an extraordinary situation.  They are being guaranteed by the Government, subsidised by the taxpayer and allowed to run themselves as some sort of quasi-independent organisations.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach - and I am sure the Minister for Finance also - told the House it was nothing to do with the Government when AIB increased the variable rates for mortgages some weeks ago.  The Taoiseach said it was nothing to do with the Government, that AIB is an independent commercial organisation and that the Government has to leave it alone.  Yet at the same time, the Government guarantees the money, some of which is used to lend out as mortgages.  This cannot happen unless one is prepared to defer to the banks, as every Government had done in the history of this State.  I thought that perhaps the crisis would prompt this Government to take a hold of the banks and to direct their operations in the interest of the people of Ireland who, after all, own the banks.  This has not happened.  The banks are still allowed to do exactly what they like commercially, under the guise of being detached, even though they are fully owned by the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  I would like to know what the Government thinks would happen if this guarantee were not extended.  As other speakers have said, all the past deposits are guaranteed and only the future or present deposits would come into this category.<\/p><p>The only reason the Minister of State appears to have given is that the banks need breathing space.  They have had a very long time to breath owing to a series of extensions, yet they are still nowhere near out of the woods and not nearly credible.<\/p><p> I worry when I hear Ministers state in the House that they have taken the advice of the NTMA.  It is about time we took a proper and critical look at the NTMA.  It is a prop for Governments.  Always, when they are in trouble regarding the finances or the banks, they take the NTMA's advice.  The NTMA is in the banking loop.  As I believe people are beginning to realise, staff in the NTMA receive vast salaries and are joined at the hip to the banks.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that Mr. Michael Somers, former head of the NTMA, was the only public servant ever to walk away with \u20ac1 million in one year.  That is a formidable achievement, but it is very difficult to understand how it happened.  What is more interesting \u2013 this is why I worry about taking advice from the NTMA \u2013 is that Mr. Somers retired on a pension of \u20ac265,000.  As if that were not enough for him, he was then compensated by being made deputy chairman of Allied Irish Banks, on a salary of \u20ac150,000 a year.  The NTMA, therefore, is used to the banking culture and springs therefrom.  Before the current chief executive of the NTMA, Mr. Corrigan, entered office, he was in AIB.  Ms Eileen Fitzpatrick who was appointed as chief executive of NewERA was in AIB beforehand.  Therefore, taking advice from the NTMA is like taking advice from the banks' country cousins.  It is deeply involved in the banking culture and will look after the banks before the nation.<\/p><p> I also worry when a Minister tells us not to worry on the grounds that we and the banks are back in the bond markets.  Our presence in the bond markets is fragile.  While it is welcome and represents an achievement, the Minister of State will know that if one pays interest at a high enough rate, one will always get back into the bond markets.  We are paying very high interest rates, as is evident from the fact that one fund, Franklin Templeton, owns 10% of the Irish bond market.  This is a precarious place to be because Franklin Templeton is showing a massive profit \u2013 I believe 12% - on its investment in the Irish bond market.  The fund is hanging over the market and if it decides to sell, yields will rise, bond prices will fall overnight and we will not be able to present such a cheery picture of Ireland's position in the bond markets.  Our position depends on the future agreement on the link between bank debt and sovereign debt.  That agreement has been promised for a long time, but it has not been reached.  There is a great deal of doubt about legacy debt and not everybody believes an agreement will be reached.  I would not rely on it.<\/p><p> The guarantee is dangerous because I worry about banking policy for the future.  The Government has cleverly spun the term &quot;pillar banks&quot; into banking language as if these banks were in some way secure.  The dependence on the so-called pillar banks is worrying.  We had a duopoly in the past and are heading for it again.  If we have another, involving Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, we will have a new cartel as sure as night follows day.  The Minister of State will remember the unhealthy dominance of the two big banks in the 1980s and 1990s.  The entry of Bank of Scotland into the market initially was good news.  When it established here, the cartel on mortgages was broken.  Apparently, this will not happen anymore because the Government's banking policy is now to build up the two pillar banks such that they will be virtually unassailable.  This territory will not be welcome to foreign banks anymore and the two pillar banks will be able to run a new cartel.  One should remember the way in which the banks overcharged, what they did in respect of DIRT and foreign exchange and how they treated whistleblowers.  The banks reigned supreme and one should remember the way in which the Central Bank co-operated in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900012#K00600","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354191000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for their contributions to the debate.  In the five minutes allowed to me I will reply on some of the issues raised.<\/p><p>  I recognise the appalling circumstances in which the country has found itself because of the reckless lending policies and arrogance of the banking sector over a generation.  Many in the House today were, in their own way, cheerleaders for that arrogance and some of the well known personalities who fronted that arrogance over a generation.  Of course, they have changed their position because the popularity stakes have changed.<\/p><p>  The task of the Government on entering office had two dimensions, the first of which was to correct the appalling deficit of fiscal mismanagement by the previous Administration having been in power for 14 years.  The second was to create the conditions in which the economy could grow again.  In this regard, it is essential to have a banking system that is trusted by the people.  Since we cannot say the banking system is trusted by the people, owing to the collapse brought about by the banks, we must take incremental steps to get the country into a better position.  The Government stands over the decisions it has taken.  The first decision it took on entering office was on further bank recapitalisation, built on the pillar banks.  This is evident from a statement issued to the House in March 2011 by the Minister for Finance.  There has since been a significant improvement in respect of the banks and the new banking culture we want to have instigated in the State.  In the first instance, we have seen money coming back into the banks.  I am not over-egging the pudding or suggesting there has been a radical inflow of money from international markets into the Irish banking system because that has not happened.  However, there has been a slow, consistent inflow of moneys into the banking system to stabilise the banks.  Deposits have stabilised.  News on AIB this week indicates that, independent of the guarantee, \u20ac500 million was raised in three year bonds and that they were four times oversubscribed.  The announcement on Bank of Ireland two weeks ago showed that, independent of the guarantee, the bank was able to obtain money in the international market.  There was no chance that this could have happened two years ago or last year.<\/p><p>  Our ambition in asking the House to accept the extension of the ELG scheme is to ensure it is brought to a swift conclusion next year.  Will those who are criticising the two Government parties today support the Government when the scheme comes to an end?  The bringing to an end of the guarantee, more than anything else, will be an example to the country, the banking sector and the international markets of our putting our house in order and changing the dynamics of the Irish banking sector.  In asking colleagues to support the motion our objective is to exit the ELG scheme at some point next year.  This would be an example of normalisation and Ireland making further progress in rebuilding the tattered banking system the Government was left to clear up.  If we are to make progress, we must have a totally new banking system.  That is why we put our store in the pillar banks.  We got rid of the directors.  It is also why the new banking unit in the Department of Finance is leading bilateral discussions with the banks and the Central Bank on a daily basis.<\/p><p>That is why the Taoiseach, T\u00e1naiste, and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have been in direct negotiations and discussions with the banks about their commitments.  They gave us a commitment when we set out the new strategy in March 2011 that, over a three-year period, \u20ac21 billion would be lent into the economy to help SMEs and to help existing businesses restructure their debt.  We will hold them to those commitments because they have been recapitalised by the taxpayer.<\/p><p> The objective is to bring this guarantee to an end and to get the banks out of the accident and emergency ward we found them in when we took up office and to get our money - the \u20ac64 billion colleagues referred to - back from them.  I agree with those who say competition is needed in the banking sector.  It would be good if banks from other markets competed in the Irish market but that will only happen when we get to a more normal arrangement when the guarantee ends.  The ambition of the Government and the banking sector is to enable banks to move to a more profitable position.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett argued for default.  He is correct that 20% of the taxes we will take in this year will go to paying the national debt.  He says we should not pay that debt, that we should default on it, as some of his descamisados in Argentina did, and take the consequences of that.  He should not forget that the Argentinian Finance Minister said that when Argentina did that this, one quarter of the population went hungry.  That is what he wants to bring down on the Irish people in the context of that crazy, mad man strategy of defaulting.  We can get this country to a better place.  It requires determination on the part of the Government to correct the deficit but also a new banking culture.  The ambition of the Government is to exit the guarantee next year and, hopefully, that will happen.  That will be another example of weaning the banks off taxpayer's money and putting them on a profitable trajectory into the future in order that we as taxpayers can get the money back that we put into them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900013#L00200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354191900,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354191900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354191900,"counter":199,"content":"<p>As a teller, under Standing Order 69 I propose that the vote be taken by other than electronic means just to remind the Labour Party that this is about the extension of the bank guarantee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900015#N00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1354191900,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The vote will proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900015#N00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"vote","time":1354192200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Question again put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 85; N\u00edl, 31.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Pearse Doherty.<\/p><p>Question again declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900016#O00025","aye":["1096","946","1079","989","1030","1071","975","1092","988","1031","972","1093","1087","1006","1101","986","994","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","1078","1014","1085","1009","1068","1055","1019","1100","1076","995","1106","1089","958","949","1033","973","1012","1043","1098","983","1021","1040","1110","1053","990","982","1023","999","1000","1082","977","1004","987","1070","985","1067","1056","1044","1060","1058","1069","1054","1073","1018","1063","1081","966","952","1074","1013","979","970","1048","961","978","1104","1065","1010","1095","950","1109","1024"],"nay":["1003","1020","1032","1083","1037","1015","959","1107","1022","1084","1050","960","1049","954","998","1008","1090","1017","981","1052","1175","984","969","1028","1005","1001","953","1178","1102","1080","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1354192500,"counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900017#P00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354192500,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan - the threatened closure of Barnardos, Buckingham Street Family Support Project, Dublin 1; (2) Deputy John O'Mahony - the suspension of grants by North East Leader Company to community groups in County Mayo and when the payment of grants will resume; (3) Deputy Tom Hayes - the need to attract multi-national investment to provide jobs in rural Ireland, particularly the need to replace jobs lost in County Tipperary; (4) Deputy James Bannon - the potential national fall-out of the loss of approximately 100 jobs at Ericsson, Athlone, County Westmeath; (5) Deputy Joan Collins - the need for the Minister for Health to intervene to ensure that the current system of the management of cystic fibrosis rooms at St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, is reviewed; (6) Deputy Gerald Nash - the future of the charitable lotteries scheme; (7) Deputy Alan Farrell - the funding of primary schools; (8) Deputy Michelle Mulherin - the need for clarification of the way that it is expected that all airports, including Ireland West, Knock, will operate in a competitive environment following the separation of Shannon from Dublin Airport; (9) Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor - the need to discourage people from availing of the services of moneylenders; (10) Deputy Thomas P.

It will also amend the Act to better provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State and to ensure compliance with the relevant EU instrument.<\/p><p>  The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory regulation for designated health and social care professions.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board for each of 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  These bodies are collectively known informally as CORU.  CORU is responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  It promotes high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputies for the valuable and thoughtful contributions made on Second and Committee Stages.  Deputies highlighted the urgent need to bring counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the 2005 Act.  I would like to now restate the commitment made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly on Committee stage to make the necessary regulations under the Act as soon as possible.  A key regulation in this regard, namely, the regulation to prescribe the qualifications needed to register under the Act, will be made when the minimum qualifications and standards of knowledge, skill and competence for future counsellors and psychotherapists have been set by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  To explain further, the regulation of designated professions under the Act is, in the first instance, activated by the registration of persons with specific qualifications approved by the relevant registration board.  These approved qualifications are awarded by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, now subsumed into Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, or by the universities.  In the case of counselling and psychotherapy, however, QQI is only now in the process of establishing standards of knowledge, skill and competence to be acquired by those wishing to practice in this field.  When these standards have been determined, in consultation with the professional bodies and other stakeholders, the educational institutions offering courses and programmes in counselling and psychotherapy can seek QQI accreditation and, in time, QQI will be able to award qualifications to those graduating from the accredited courses.  These QQI qualifications will be the minimum qualifications required of counsellors and psychotherapists to register under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, will be asking Quality and Qualifications Ireland to conclude its work as soon as possible next year.  In tandem, the Department will work with CORU to have all the other necessary arrangements in place so that there will be no delay in establishing the counsellors and psychotherapists registration board when the minimum qualification standards have been set.  On Committee Stage, Deputies raised concerns about inadequately trained counsellors and psychotherapists advertising services to the public.  While many services, private and public, have quality assurance arrangements in place, as have a number of reputable professional bodies, there is cause for concern that standards are not universally high.  Deputies pointed out that these advertisements are often aimed at people in vulnerable or distressing situations.  It was asked whether it would be possible to require those advertising counselling and psychotherapy services to alert the public to the fact that counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently regulated under the 2005 Act.  This may be a worthwhile temporary measure in the interest of public safety particularly and the Department is now seeking legal advice on the practicalities involved.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, hopes to be able to come to a clear policy position on this proposal shortly.<\/p><p>  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900017#P01200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1354192500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>As previously stated, Sinn F\u00e9in supports this Bill, which as indicated now and previously by the Minister of State, is a technical Bill amending the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which established the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and, following a protracted debate in this House, which Deputy Neville will recall all too well, 12 health and social care professions.  While the main purpose of the Bill is to allow the Minister for Health to continue to make appointments to the council because the 12 registration boards have not yet been established and, therefore, are not in a position to make their own nominations.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to update us on this issue.  Have there been further developments in terms of the establishment of registration boards across the identified 12 professions?  <\/p><p> One of the issues which was the subject of substantial debate on Committee Stage was extending the number of stated professions.  I refer specifically to an amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzpatrick on behalf of his colleague, Deputy Neville, in which he proposed adding the role of psychological therapist to the list.  I record my support for that proposition which I also supported during the 2005 debate on the principal Act.  I would like to see us moving forward speedily in including it and other health care professionals in the accredited list.<\/p><p> I wish to focus once more on the situation that applies across several of the professions mentioned.  I will use the example of speech and language therapists to underscore what is a major need, namely, lifting the current recruitment embargo in order that the current demand for specific professional services can be met by the supply.  There is no question but that we have significant numbers of highly trained speech and language therapists - as we have across other professions named within the cohort of 12 provided for in the Bill - for whom there are no vacancies or opportunities to perform their specific role in the health service.  We are continuing to train a significant number year on year of highly skilled, highly motivated young speech and language therapists, but we are training them for export, for employment overseas.  This is really sad because, make no mistake, there is a huge demand for both adult and child speech and language support services across the State.  To lose so many unemployed, fully qualified therapists to other countries across the globe is a source of huge regret for every one of us and a terrible reality for graduates, their parents and communities.  Again, I take the opportunity on Fifth Stage to make a special appeal on behalf of those who have chosen a particular career path across all of the listed professions provided for and enumerated in the list of those who will have immediate access to roles on the councils.  It is not only in their interests, in terms of career opportunities, but also in the interests of those of us who depend on the health service that the recruitment embargo be lifted at the earliest opportunity in a programmatic way, if necessary.  It is incumbent on us to open up opportunities for our highly trained young people to remain at home, as well as to seriously address the very significant and identified need that is not being catered for.<\/p><p> I welcome the passage of the Bill and look forward to the time when it can be declared redundant, when the Minister will no longer require these powers and the various representative bodies of the named professions will be able to make their own appointments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900017#P01300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354193100,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I too welcome the passage of the Bill which will bring to an end the delay in the introduction of the councils.  It is seven years since the original Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed.  I was involved in the debate at the time and everybody accepted, including the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, former Deputy Tim O'Malley, that the professions of counselling and psychotherapy should be included in that legislation.  However, there was disagreement among the professional bodies at the time and the then Minister of State suggested there might be legal difficulties in doing so, but he gave a guarantee that once agreement was reached, he would do so,  He also said that if agreement was not reached, he would do it anyway.  Some 22 psychological therapies organisations came together, reached an agreement and drew up a report which was presented to the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, former Deputy John Moloney in 2008.  However, very little, if anything, has happened since.<\/p><p>  I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State that he is progressing that issue to ensure regulations will be put in place because it is a very serious matter.  Untrained and unqualified individuals are acting as counsellors and psychotherapists and engaging with very vulnerable persons who are suicidal, suffering from eating and various psychological disorders.  There is no regulation in this area.  The Minister of State referred to the fact that organisations were providing short courses and awarding &quot;qualifications&quot; to allow people to act as psychotherapists.  He promised that he would try to deal with this issue before the regulations came into force, about which I am very pleased.<\/p><p>  I will give Deputies two quick examples of the courses which cause concern.  I have a leaflet advertising an advanced diploma in suicide studies, a three module course.  The first on suicide prevention is run over two weekends.  The second and third modules on suicide intervention and suicide post intervention measures are also run over two weekends.  Therefore, the prospective student will receive an advanced diploma in suicide studies after six weekends.  I have another brochure advertising a course on eating disorders.  There are seven modules run over seven weekends.  At the end of the course the student is awarded a diploma in practitioner skills for eating disorders.  As Deputies will know, eating disorders are highly complex and involve psychological, psychiatric and general medicine aspects and sufferers have physical, mental and psychological issues.  The cost of the aforementioned course is \u20ac3,000.  The leaflet advises that the course is aimed at professionals, but when the brochure was brought to my attention some years ago, my secretary who has no interest in the area applied for a place on the course.  She received a reply immediately, with a hand-written note welcoming her to the course, despite the fact that she had no related qualifications.  Thus, over seven weekends, she was able to obtain a diploma in practitioner skills for eating disorders.  This illustrates the seriousness of the issue.  We must protect vulnerable individuals.<\/p><p>In November 2011, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported on a high-profile psychotherapist who was charging &#8364;3,000 for a course leading to a diploma in the treatment of eating disorders despite having no official professional accreditation in Ireland or medical or psychological qualifications from any university.  The psychotherapist claimed that diplomas were accredited to the British Psychological Society but a spokesman for the society stated that it did not recognise any of the courses offered by her organisation.<\/p><p>This case demonstrates the need for regulation.  I have been dealing with reputable Irish professional psychology bodies for many years and they do very good work.  A total of 22 organisations operate in the field of psychological therapies, including counselling and psychotherapy.  This is a broad area which includes marriage counselling and a range of societal counselling.  These organisations register people in a proper manner but the looseness of the regulatory environment should have been addressed many years ago.  We would not dream of allowing a doctor or nurse to operate without being registered.  Perhaps one of the reasons for the lack of regulation is that counselling and psychological therapy is a new field relative to other professions.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Minister's position on the issue.  There is no difficulty in regulating psychotherapists, but how does one define and regulate a counsellor?  Are the members of the Council of State counsellors?  They are, because they advise the President.  There are good community counsellors who know where to refer people and are conscious of the limits of their knowledge.  They will not go beyond those limits in advising people on finance, day-to-day living or household budgeting.  They do good work within the limits of their knowledge, but we must ensure that people operating in the delicate area of psychotherapy and counselling are regulated.  Bodywhys, the eating disorders association, has reported that people have been seriously damaged by unqualified counsellors.  As Members will be aware, there is a high level of mortality among those with eating disorders.<\/p><p>I welcome the passage of the Bill.  The Minister's objective is to finalise the Bill in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900018#Q00200","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354193700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the two Deputies for their contributions on Fifth Stage.

The Civil Defence Bill 2012 provides for the repeal of the Civil Defence Act 2002, the dissolution of the Civil Defence board and the transfer of its functions and other responsibilities back to the Department of Defence.  The purpose of the Bill is to bring the management, development and administration of the Civil Defence at national level back into the Department of Defence, where it resided when the organisation was founded in 1950.  In the context of current Government policy on bringing the functions of many State agencies back to their parent Departments, it has been decided that the functions of the board should return to the Department of Defence and specifically to a branch within that Department.<\/p><p>  The board was established following the passage of the Civil Defence Act in 2002, the stated purpose of which was to update Civil Defence legislation generally and to establish a board to oversee and manage the future development of civil defence at national level.  On a day-to-day basis the 2002 Act did not make any fundamental changes to the governing structures.  Policy formulation remained with the Minister for Defence and the key relationship for effective civil defence operations between local authorities and the organisation at national level was not altered in any way.<\/p><p>  I wish to put on record for the avoidance of doubt that the Bill will not alter the fundamental structures that have served the Civil Defence well over many years and supported the voluntary ethos that has been the hallmark of the organisation since its foundation.<\/p><p> I take the opportunity to express my sincere gratitude and that of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, to each and every person who gave of his or her time to serve with distinction on the Civil Defence board and its statutory committees.  I commend the board and its committees for their contributions to the ongoing development of Civil Defence in the past nine years in bringing forward plans and proposals which have driven the evolution of the organisation in that period.  The day-to-day role of Civil Defence is to provide a range of supports for the front-line emergency services and community supports at local level.  The training programmes and strategic development plans developed by the board in recent years have very much embraced that support role to front-line services across a range of activities.  The benefits of these policies were very clear to communities all across the country during the severe weather in recent years in the comprehensive and sustained nature of the response from Civil Defence acting in support of all front-line services.  The modern Civil Defence organisation, trained and equipped to the highest standards, is capable of assisting whichever of the front-line emergency services calls on it for assistance, as we recently witnessed when Wexford Civil Defence carried out a extensive search of Wexford Harbour for a missing person on Sunday, 18 November, with the support of other boats crews from the region.  I commend Civil Defence for its work in that search.<\/p><p> I recognise and support all of the volunteers in their continued efforts to support local communities.  The Bill will in no way diminish these efforts.  In the future, as part of the Department of Defence, Civil Defence at national level will be fully integrated with the planning and implementation of our response capability for major emergencies.  This will be achieved by working through the Office of Emergency Planning and the Defence Forces.  It will be able to devote all of its energies to the core business of Civil Defence, namely, training volunteers to the highest professional health and safety standards.  It will no longer have to devote valuable resources to complying with its own governance requirements.  In the current economic climate I am delighted to say we have succeeded in maintaining the current level of funding for Civil Defence at \u20ac5.585 million per annum in the face of reduced funding to almost all other State bodies.  It is our intention to maintain that level of funding in so far as it is possible to do so.<\/p><p> As I said during the recent debate on the Bill in the Seanad, it is worth repeating for the avoidance of doubt that the future development of Civil Defence will remain of paramount importance to me, the Minister and the Government.  With that development in mind, a Civil Defence forum will be established after the Bill is enacted, comprising the main players in Civil Defence and members from the wider emergency response community.  Central to these deliberations will be the critical involvement of representatives of the Civil Defence officers and volunteers based in each local authority area.  The purpose of the forum will be to assist the Civil Defence branch of the Department to consider the major issues affecting or likely to affect its development.<\/p><p> I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 deal with the dissolution of the Civil Defence board, the date of which will be set by order.  Sections 4 to and 6, inclusive, will ensure the transfer of land, property, rights and liabilities, leases and licenses from the board back to Minister will take place.  Section 7 ensures any claim in respect of loss or injury arising before dissolution will lie against the Minister, not the board.  Furthermore, legal proceedings pending to which the board is a party will continue with the substitution of the Minster in the proceedings.<\/p><p> Section 8 makes provisions for functions commenced but not completed by the board before its dissolution.  All functions partially completed will be carried on by the Minister.  All moneys, stocks, shares and securities registered to the board prior to the dissolution date will be transferred to the Minister.  The income of the board was derived from the grant-in-aid from the Defence Vote and no shares or securities were registered to the board.<\/p><p> Section 9 provides that the former director general of the board will submit, within six months of dissolution, the final accounts of the board to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Furthermore, he must also submit to the Minister the final annual report of the board within nine months.  The Minister must, as soon as practicable thereafter, lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The transfer of staff and the director general back from the board to the Department of Defence is dealt with in section 10, while section 11 ensures any contract or agreement in force before dissolution day between the board and any other person or body shall continue in force in the name of the Minister.<\/p><p> Section 12 deals with Civil Defence plans and sets out the requirement for local authorities to submit a plan within 12 months of dissolution to the Minister.  The components of the plan are clearly set out for the authorities, as well as a requirement for them to review the plan within three years.  <\/p><p> Section 13 amends section 221 of the Local Government Act 2001 to ensure annual reports prepared by local authorities will make suitable reference to the performance of their functions relating to civil defence, including the expenditure incurred by them in carrying out these functions.  Section 14 continues the Department of Defence's grant of funds provided by the Oireachtas for the local authorities for the purpose of defraying expenditure incurred by the authorities in carrying out civil defence functions.<\/p><p> The recruitment of Civil Defence members by local authorities is dealt with in section 15, while the requirement for and the details to be contained within the Civil Defence members' register are outlined in section 16.  Section 17 repeals the 2002 Civil Defence Act, while section 18 deals with the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.<\/p><p> This legislation will provide Civil Defence with the ideal platform to strengthen its capacity to continue to develop as a first class second-line emergency response service, while retaining its voluntary ethos and continuing with its community support activities.  I am pleased to submit the legislation for the consideration of the House and look forward to hearing the views and contributions of Deputies in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900019#R00500","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354194300,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and pay tribute to Deputy Stanton who in October provided Members with an opportunity to hear directly from the chairman of the Civil Defence board at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, at which there was a useful exchange of views.  I point out to the Chief Whip that it is useful that legislation is ventilated at committees in advance of being taken in the House.  This is a positive development.<\/p><p>  I am conscious in taking this legislation that the Minister of State is sitting in the same seat occupied in 2002 by my late colleague and friend, S\u00e9amus Brennan, when the 2002 Act was first brought forward.  At the time it seemed like sensible legislation which sought to empower and introduce a dynamic to Civil Defence that he considered at the time might best be achieved by providing for a degree of autonomy for the body.  If we look back at what happened in the intervening years, we will see that far from being autonomous, it became semi-detached from the Department of Defence.  We are now operating in a completely changed economic climate.  We are going through a period of retrenchment and looking at a plethora of agencies in existence.  For that reason, Fianna F\u00e1il is prepared to support the proposal to bring the agency back within the remit of the Department.  However, we have a number of questions to which we would like answers.  In general, however, we support the initiative.<\/p><p>  On a broader level, we have some concerns about the return of Civil Defence to the Department.<\/p><p>This is happening at a time of radical change in that Department.  The number of Army battalions has been reduced from three to two and there is a particularly low level of morale within the Defence Forces.  It is clear from the response to recent parliamentary questions that there is a disproportionate level of promotional opportunities for people in the Defence Forces in the NCO ranks.  We are living through a period where the Reserve Defence Forces consider their position is under threat.  <\/p><p>In regard to the initial parent body, they are not returning to a stage where all the players are happy and delighted with what is happening.  When the late Seamus Brennan introduced the legislation in 2002, its purpose was two-fold, to update the Civil Defence legislation generally because up to then Civil Defence operated under the Air Raid Precautions Acts 1939 and 1946 and a number of emergency powers.  It also provided a necessary legislative framework for the development of the Civil Defence organisation which was an important element of the chapter on Civil Defence contained in the Government's White Paper of 2000 on Defence.  The Bill provided for the establishment of a Civil Defence board to oversee, supervise and co-ordinate the operation and development of Civil Defence at national level in co-operation with and in support of all the emergency services, such as the Garda, the fire service, the ambulance service and the Coast Guard.  The board was also given the role of advising the Minister on policy issues and to carry out all of the non-policy roles relating to Civil Defence that had up to then been carried out by the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence.  There were approximately 6,000 volunteer members in the organisation in 2002.  <\/p><p>Following the end of the Cold War, the principal focus of Civil Defence in the 1990s changed to one of community support and emergency response.  This was highlighted with the launch in 1992 of the development programme, Towards 2000, which was designed to put in place the structures to develop the skills that would enable the organisation to face the future challenges.  The aim of the programme was to develop Civil Defence as a top class second line emergency service within the local community.  From 1992 to 2002 the organisation learned to operate in close support of the front-line emergency services and so integrated in a meaningful way into the day to day emergency planning structures.  This has allowed the Civil Defence organisation to focus on serving the needs of local communities.  <\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the value we all place on the role of the Civil Defence.  Very often we learn about that through our direct experiences in our local communities where our neighbours, friends and colleagues engage actively with Civil Defence.  We see the valuable role they play not only in times of crises - obviously we appreciate what it does at such times - but during periods of inclement weather and during searches for missing persons.  Much positive comment has been made of its role in the aftermath of the tragedy of the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i>.<i><\/i>We realise that the members of Civil Defence are engaged in an activity that is of enormous value to the local community.  They enrich the lives of people in their community and contribute to its overall well being.  It behoves us to pay tribute to those people throughout the length and breadth of the country who play an active role in the organisation.  If I read the statistics correctly there are in excess 6,000 members on its books but it has 4,500 active members.  <\/p><p>Under the legislative proposals before the House, I suggest we look at innovative ways whereby Civil Defence could be encouraged and facilitated and given the necessary resources to continue to develop the valuable role it plays in local communities.  I say that against the background of being conscious of huge numbers of people in our communities who are no longer involved in gainful employment and who are looking for ways and means through which they can contribute to the well-being of the community in which they live and through which they can find meaning for their lives and a reason to get up in the morning.  In particular, there is merit in an idea put forward by one of the Government backbenchers for the development of Civil Defence to the point where it could be facilitated with a cadet corps, where young people could get involved at local level and avail of the high quality training programmes being made available by Civil Defence.  The money spent in expanding the organisation would be well spent and would ultimately be cost neutral in terms of the benefits that would accrue to communities.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of me coming from Kildare not to acknowledge what I have seen in my county in terms of the work of people from the age of 18 to 80 years who turn out time and again in support of various crises and various events in the constituency.  I learned much of what I know about Civil Defence from a great Offaly man, an all-Ireland medal winner, the late Comt. Larry Coughlan who, while a Civil Defence officer in Kildare, did enormous work to develop and promote an understanding of the organisation and to increase its membership there.  That role is continuing under the leadership of Patricia McNeela as it continues in many counties across the country.<\/p><p>There are a number of areas of concern.  Under the provisions of the 2002 Act, the new Civil Defence board was empowered to initiate and foster contacts with other Departments and State authorities, external educational and research institutions both national and international, as well as utilising its own resources to enable it to develop optimum standards for the training of volunteers.  We need to be assured in the context of these changes that this capacity will not be curtailed by the board's return to the Department of Defence.  It is estimated that enacting the legislation will save &#8364;60,000 per year.  In the overall context that is not a significant amount but will the Minister give an indication of the cost of the changes, that is, the move from the board system to the return to the Department of Defence?<\/p><p>That the Civil Defence works closely with local authorities means that its response can be immediate and locally focused.  That is a great strength of the organisation.  We saw it in north County Kildare recently and in other parts of the country where missing person situations gave rise to an immediate positive response from Civil Defence.  The public need to be assured that the nature of that response can continue to be focused on the local need and as rapid as in the past. <\/p><p>When introducing the 2002 legislation, the late Seamus Brennan said it was vital for the Department charged with responsibility for co-ordinating the emergency plans of local authorities and with the supervisory and co-ordinating role in relation to all local authority activities to be represented on the new board. <\/p><p>Consequently, the Bill provides for a representative from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with expertise in emergency planning to be a member of the board.  This is an area in which we might consider possible amendments.  I am concerned that the circuit of management is moving away from the local authority back to the Department of Defence.  One wonders whether the lines of communication can be as smooth and as effective as they should be.  What arrangements are being made to maintain strong expertise in emergency planning in Civil Defence?<\/p><p>The then Minister, Mr. Brennan, said: &quot;It is important in terms of national emergency planning that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland be represented on the new board.&quot;  Will the Minister of State be able to give effect to this and what will be the nature of the relationship between the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Department of Defence?  Mr. Brennan continued:<blockquote>With the many threats to our environment now evident, it is important that whatever first line service is charged with combating the particular threat can call on the resources of Civil Defence to support it in its endeavours.  Having an EPA representative on the board will be of great assistance in developing strategies to offer support in such circumstances.<\/blockquote>Again, no more than with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, having ready lines of access, given the need for ongoing communication between the agencies, seems to be essential.  I am sure the Minister of State will be able to give us some indication of what his views are in that regard.<\/p><p>Current arrangements provide for the Civil Defence Officers Association, CDOA, to be represented on the board and contribute to its management.  How does the Government propose to ensure the voice of volunteers is heard in the proposed new arrangement?  The 2002 Act sought to strengthen and maintain the voluntary ethos of Civil Defence and ensure the voice of the volunteer would be clearly heard on the management board, something we hope will continue.<\/p><p>At the recent Oireachtas committee meeting with the chairman of the board it was mentioned a forum might be established which would liaise with and consult interested parties from outside the Department of Defence.  I would like to think we could go a little further than suggesting the establishment of a forum and make actual provision to ensure a forum is brought into existence.  Such a forum need not cost any money and we would not have to pay anyone to serve on it, but it could have a very useful role to play in the public interest.<\/p><p>A further question arises.  Is it in the Department of Defence that this body should find its new home or, to put it another way, is it the place to which it should return?  One is conscious that it is in continuous engagement with the local authorities and, through them, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In the consideration given to the legislation which, as I said, we are prepared to support, was any thought given to whether the Department of Defence was, in fact, the most appropriate location for management of Civil Defence?  Should we be looking at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as the more likely home for such a body, not least given the critical role it will play in national emergency planning?  As the debate progresses, I am sure we will have the opportunity to tease out matters further.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the role played by the organisation and the value of the contribution volunteers make.  We hear a lot of talk about voluntarism.  If there are people who want to do something to serve their communities, they could avail of the opportunity to go to the local Civil Defence officer, look at the training programmes available and consider how they might become involved.  I make one final plea to the Minister of State to ensure resources are made available in order that those members of the public who wish to become involved in what is a valuable and productive endeavour, one that produces real and potential local heroes, can do so.  Civil Defence should have the opportunity to recruit as many as possible of these people who are enthusiastic about society and their local community.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900020#S00200","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354195500,"counter":226,"content":"<p>While Sinn F\u00e9in is not opposed to allowing the Civil Defence Bill 2012 to proceed to Committee Stage, it has some concerns about the impact the Bill will have on the functioning and management of Civil Defence.  The Civil Defence board, as constituted, represents a broad balance of interests, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Garda, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the emergency services.  There should be no doubt about the value of their input into how Civil Defence functions and, whatever changes are made to the body in this or other legislation, a mechanism must be included to ensure it can draw on the valuable expertise and opinions of these other groups.<\/p><p>  If the Bill is passed in its current form and the property and assets are transferred back to the Department of Defence, the result will be a mere \u20ac60,000 in savings.  This is a very tiny amount in budgetary terms but not to be sniffed at.  An extra \u20ac60,000 allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to a women's refuge would make all the difference in terms of how it could provide a service for vulnerable women and child victims of domestic violence.  The point is that there is no value in proceeding with legislation on the basis that it will save \u20ac60,000 if the lack of expertise on the previous board becomes an issue.  If a cost-benefit analysis of the impact of this lack of expertise demonstrates that it will cost more in the long term, obviously, it will not be worth continuing.  On that basis, Sinn F\u00e9in is examining the legislation to ensure expertise is not lost in the restructuring of the Civil Defence board.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to commend the work of Civil Defence - the ordinary people across Ireland who do extraordinary things acting in a voluntary capacity as members of communities.  I saw this myself in my own home county of Donegal during the spell of severe weather in late 2010-early 2011 when we had snow and freezing cold weather conditions for a sustained period of two months.  Civil Defence was deployed to assist the emergency services in keeping everything going.  Its members are trained to professional standards and can be called upon at any time to volunteer in emergencies.  They do great work and no change should be made that will have a negative impact on their ability to do it.  We must maintain the resources and supports available to them.<\/p><p>  We have a further concern that the parameters for funding are being changed.  What was a responsibility of the local authorities is being transferred to within the Minister's discretion and funding could be cut.  I should say this was a responsibility of the Civil Defence board in how it allocated moneys to local authorities, for which there are clear parameters and criteria in place.  This will now be done at the Minister's discretion and the fear is that, in the context of ongoing cuts in local authorities, they may not be allocated the necessary resources to support Civil Defence activities in their respective areas.  We must receive assurances from the Minister that funding will be maintained for Civil Defence training programmes and activities, as appropriate.<\/p><p>  I am also conscious that, while Civil Defence acts in support of the Defence Forces and the emergency services in dealing with the effects of flooding and heavy snowfalls, the Government is engaging in a serious programme of cutbacks within the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>That in itself will lead to its own problems, but we must not allow a situation to develop where the Civil Defence ends up being the fall-back plan when it comes to emergency service provision because the Government has hammered away at it with its cutbacks agenda.<\/p><p> As I said to Minister about the Reserve Defence Forces and the changes in that regard, a mistake was made in not giving adequate time to the representative association to respond and make an input before the so-called value for money report was agreed and published.  I do not doubt the Minister of State has the same value and respect for the Reserve Defence Forces and the Civil Defence as I have.  It is not about that; it is about involving those affected in the change and the decision-making process.  It is clear from the feedback we are getting from the Reserve Defence Forces that they are annoyed about that.  I call on the Minister of State to involve the Civil Defence members\u2019 representative association and to invite suggested amendments or ideas from it on the Bill as it moves through Committee Stage.  I will do that, but I urge the Minister of State to do the same to ensure that we protect the integrity of everything that has happened to date.  We must continue to resource the Civil Defence and give its members the necessary training because they are very proud of what they do.  We must continue to facilitate active citizenship.  The Minister of State and I both know members of the Civil Defence.  They are wonderful people who have a sense of community commitment.  They want to do more than the average citizen in terms of contributing and being a backup to the Permanent Defence Force and the emergency services.<\/p><p> The key issues are to ensure that the balance of skills currently available to the Civil Defence Board is maintained in the new arrangements, and that there is an advisory stakeholder role in the future management of the service by the Department.  Local authorities must continue to be resourced by the Minister.  I ask the Minister of State to give an assurance that will be the case and that the Civil Defence will have what it requires to support its activities.  Participation in the Reserve Defence Forces and the Civil Defence are in the main voluntary contributions to community and society by some of our finest citizens.  We must show in actions as well as words that we value the contribution and partnership they offer and that we will continue to resource them properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900022#U00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354196100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Healy Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900023#V00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1354196100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The Bill seeks to repeal the Civil Defence Board Act 2002, dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions and responsibilities of the board back to the Department of Defence.<\/p><p>  Civil defence is important for the country, in particular for local communities.  The origins of civil defence go back a long way.  Much of the legal basis for the Civil Defence service is founded on the Air-Raid Precautions Acts 1939-46.  The legislation, together with the Local Government Acts 1941-76 continues to form the main legal basis for the Civil Defence.<\/p><p>  The precursor organisation to the Civil Defence was the air raid protection organisation, which obviously dated to the Second World War and had a particular responsibility in those times.  Today\u2019s service has developed and grown and is now an experienced, active and efficient emergency response organisation supporting front-line emergency organisations and local communities.  The Civil Defence organisation itself was founded in 1950 and now has approximately 6,400 volunteers, approximately 4,500 of whom are active on a regular basis.  It provides a professional support to the front-line emergency services and support to local communities.  Some of the activities in which they are involved include the support of communities in the event of severe weather conditions such as flooding, snowfalls and various emergencies, in addition to the organisation and stewarding of public events.  The Minister of State referred to a search for a missing person in Wexford.  I was involved with the Civil Defence in a search for a missing person in the Clonmel area recently.  The Civil Defence provides a range of local services on a voluntary basis.<\/p><p>  It would be remiss of us if we did not extend our thanks and appreciation to the organisation and the individual members and volunteers for the wonderful work they do on a regular basis in all of our communities.  The fact that it is a volunteer organisation is something that is part of the Irish ethos.  I refer to the old saying: Ar sc\u00e1th a ch\u00e9ile a mhaireann na daoine.  That is the ethos of Civil Defence and the entire volunteer structure in this country.  In the past two and a half years Volunteer Ireland and local volunteer centres have registered more than 34,000 volunteers and 4,173 volunteer organisations who have contributed in excess of 1 million hours of their time to local communities.<\/p><p>  My first contact with Civil Defence came when I was a young clerical officer in South Tipperary County Council.  My staff officer at the time was a man called Eddie Bergin, who was also the Civil Defence officer for the county.  He did tremendous work and put the organisation on a sound footing, not just during his tenure but for the future.  He was followed by other committed individuals such as Sean O\u2019Dwyer and Eddie Cooney.  The local Civil Defence officer in south Tipperary today is Dolores Fahey and she does tremendous work in the county.<\/p><p>  I hope the Minister of State can assure us that the changes being made in the Bill will not in any way impact negatively on the work of the Civil Defence in communities.  I welcome what the Minister of State outlined in his speech.  \u201cI wish to put on record for the avoidance of doubt that the Bill will not alter the fundamental structures that have served the Civil Defence well over many years and supported the voluntary ethos that has been the hallmark of the organisation since its foundation.\u201d  I take the Minister of State at his word and hope that also means the organisation will be properly resourced and funded in the future.  Civil Defence has done considerable work in communities and deserves the support of all Members.  I hope that the views of those involved in the Civil Defence Officers Association and volunteers on the Bill will be taken into account.  I hope also that the forum to which the Minister of State referred, which will be set up when the Bill is passed, will be put on a statutory footing in order that all stakeholders will have a voice and will be heard on matters concerning the organisation and Civil Defence activities in the future.<\/p><p>The core issue of members' involvement and the future involvement of the forum or any other structure is vitally important.  <\/p><p> I refer to the situation in south Tipperary.  The Minister recently indicated that moneys would be available and also that he supported the building of a Garda station in Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  I welcome that commitment and hope moneys will be provided in the budget to progress it.  Given that the functions of the Civil Defence board are now returning to his Department, will the Minister consider locating the organisation in that complex?  It would be an excellent centre, not just for Civil Defence and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, but also for all emergency organisations.  I know Civil Defence would wish to be involved, as it hopes to be located on the Kickham Barracks site.  I ask the Minister to look at this suggestion to see if it would be feasible.<\/p><p> I look forward to the Bill progressing through the House, with particular regard to the forum and the involvement of stakeholders, and hope there will be a statutory framework through which their views can be sought and given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900023#V00400","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354196700,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Seamus Healy and the Technical Group for allowing me to share time.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the repeal of the Civil Defence Act 2002, the dissolution of the Civil Defence board and the transfer of its functions and other responsibilities back to the Department of Defence.  Its purpose is to bring responsibility for the management, development and administration of Civil Defence at national level back into the Department where it lay at the time the organisation was founded in the 1950s.  It was designed to undertake very important activities and take measures to defend persons and property against all eventualities, including radioactive fall-out or biological or chemical warfare attacks on the State.  I have no great difficulty with the purpose of the Bill and commend the great work done by the Civil Defence board and its members during the years.  The board and its committees have overseen the development of Civil Defence at a national level.<\/p><p>  Coincidentally, this week saw the publication by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government of an expert report which stated a radioactive leak at the Sellafield nuclear plant would not pose serious health concerns in this country.  That is hard to believe.  The Sellafield nuclear plant is on a site on the edge of the Irish Sea in Cumbria, but, according to the report commissioned by the Government, it poses no health risk to Ireland.  The report states that even a worst case incident such as a massive explosion would not produce &quot;observable health effects in Ireland&quot;.  This flies in the face not only of what all of us know but also contradicts a British Government watchdog report issued earlier this month which found that hazardous nuclear waste at Sellafield posed an &quot;intolerable risk&quot; to people and the environment.  A public spending watch group warned that plans to replace ageing nuclear waste facilities at Sellafield that posed &quot;significant risks&quot; to the population faced considerable uncertainty.  If such a catastrophic event were to occur, it would be a perfect example of where we would need the massive manpower and efforts of Civil Defence.<\/p><p>  In a recent debate in the Seanad the Minister of State highlighted the role played by Civil Defence during the rescue operation following the tragic sinking of a trawler in Glandore Harbour, County Cork, last January, with the loss of five lives.  In an operation lasting more than 27 days an average of 36 Civil Defence volunteers per day, drawn from nine local authority areas, assisted in the search for the missing trawlermen.  Civil Defence volunteers served for almost 8,000 hours in that operation.  I join the Minister of State in commending all the volunteers involved.<\/p><p>  Civil Defence is an organisation with approximately 6,000 members who voluntarily make themselves available in their spare time.  Civil Defence is a respected organisation with highly trained and effective members who provide valued and appreciated support for the emergency services and the community.  It is a voluntary organisation of dedicated men and women who assist the community and freely give of their time.  They provide invaluable backup for the full-time emergency services and casualty, rescue, auxiliary fire and welfare services when needed.  I offer the example of Kerry Civil Defence which is headed by people such as Mr. Tom Brosnan and has more than 240 volunteers who assist in all kinds of operations during severe weather conditions.  A number of years ago they had to transport public health nurses to take care of their patients and also provided transport for members of the general public in coping with their day-to-day difficulties during that awful spell of bad weather.  They provide invaluable assistance for organisations such as the Kerry mountain rescue team which also does excellent work.  There is a great attraction for climbers in the mountains of County Kerry and, given the law of averages, accidents and incidents will take place on the hills and in the mountains.  We are very fortunate to have such a good rescue team.  Its members also assist Civil Defence during major events such as the annual cycle around the Ring of Kerry, the Rose of Tralee festival, Puck Fair and the 15 August celebrations in Kenmare.  On all of these big occasions one can see the work and input of Civil Defence, the members of which are available when wanted.  The Kerry county manager and Kerry County Council also support Civil Defence in recognition of the valuable contribution the organisation makes on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  It is essential that the vital link between local authorities and Civil Defence is continued.  It should not be affected in any way by the transfer of functions back to the Department.  Local knowledge and communication with local authorities are essential to ensure the effective working of Civil Defence teams.  This line of communication must remain open to ensure a immediate response to emergencies.  I would not want to see the enactment of the Bill leading to a dilution or removal of the understanding of the work Civil Defence does throughout the country.<\/p><p> As already stated, all Civil Defence members are volunteers.  In that context, we must ensure that Civil Defence's budget in respect of equipment and training is protected.  It is the Minister's job to ensure that this happens and I have no doubt but that he will do his job.  He certainly realises the importance of the work done by Civil Defence volunteers in his local community and the wider constituency he represents.  I wish the Bill well and I look forward to its passage through the Houses.  I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to take this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900024#W00200","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354197300,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Feighan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900025#X00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1354197300,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

And it matters profoundly.  It does more than help people beat the odds; it changes the odds.\"  I am of the view that this statement is acutely true when it comes to the work of the Civil Defence.  The Civil Defence has many functions including search and rescue, the provision of auxiliary fire services and radiation monitoring.  I am very much aware of the fantastic work performed by Dublin Civil Defence volunteers, particularly those in the D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown area.<\/p><p>  The work of the Civil Defence, especially during periods of flooding, has been immense.  Beginning in the early hours, on Thursday, 2 July last, a total of 59 Civil Defence personnel were involved in flood relief activity in Dublin.  Some 18 people were evacuated from Sherrard Street in Dublin's city centre by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and accommodated at the Dublin Civil Defence emergency accommodation centre.  An emergency rescue vehicle distributed approximately 100 sandbags to 23 houses in the Sandymount area.  Civil Defence fire crews were on standby at Swords, Blanchardstown, Nutgrove-Rathfarnham and D\u00fan Laoghaire, with further crews operating from Civil Defence headquarters.  The Civil Defence casualty service was also on stand-by at Malahide, D\u00fan Laoghaire and Mount Argus.  The professionalism and care displayed by the Civil Defence on the date to which I refer was extremely impressive and it made me realise the importance of the organisation.  No one would disagree that the people who work in our emergency services are heroic individuals.  I agree with Deputy \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl that Civil Defence volunteers are local heroes.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the dissolution of the Civil Defence Board and for the transfer of its functions and other responsibilities back to the Department of Defence.  I thank all those who served on the Civil Defence Board and its various committees.  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to maintain the current level of funding for the Civil Defence at \u20ac5.585 million per annum.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to reduce the number of State bodies and the Bill is proof of the Government's action in this regard.  Shortly after taking up office, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, decided that the functions of the Civil Defence Board should be transferred back into the Department of Defence.  The Bill gives legislative effect to that decision.<\/p><p>  Progress is being made in the context of reducing the number of State agencies.  In that context, significant streamlining is taking place in the Department of Education and Skills.  The amalgamation of 33 VECs into 16 educational training boards will reduce the number of State agencies by 17.  Some ten agencies under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are being dissolved.  Six public bodies under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have been either merged or restructured.  This includes the merger of Dublin Tourism and F\u00e1ilte Ireland.  The number of agencies which come under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been reduced by four, with review pending in respect of a number of others.  Three bodies which come within the remit of the Department of Health have been dissolved or merged.  Similar work is under way in other Government Departments.  Other reforms, including the merger of the National Qualifications Authority, FETAC and HETAC into a single body, are in train.  During the next three years, the Government will continue to rationalise and restructure agencies and ensure that value for money is obtained for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, has guaranteed that the dissolution of the Civil Defence Board will not have a negative knock-on effect in respect of the Civil Defence.  At the end of 2011 he gave a commitment to the effect that &quot;The proposed transfer of functions will result in verifiable savings and will allow management to develop the provision of training support, which is a key demand in a voluntary organisation like Civil Defence rather than duplicating the corporate governance of the Department.&quot;  As a result of the downturn in our economy and the commitment that was made by the previous Government to the troika, streamlining must occur, savings must be made and rationalisation of agencies must take place.  These things will continue to happen.  I endorse the measures contained in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900025#X00400","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1354197300,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill, which is in line with the current policy to bring the functions of many State agencies back within their parent Departments.  The Bill makes provision for the dissolution of the Civil Defence Board and the transfer of its functions back to the Department of Defence.  The Civil Defence Board is funded from grant aid provided out of the Department of Defence's Vote.<\/p><p>  The Civil Defence officers of the relevant local authorities oversee the delivery of Civil Defence functions.  These officers are full-time employees of local authorities and are responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence matters.  Civil Defence instructors come from all over the country in order to be receive training in a wide variety of areas at Civil Defence headquarters in Rosscrea.  The Irish Civil Defence was set up in 1950, to be part of the national defence structure as the necessary civil response to potential hazards which might arise in a war situation.  I do not recall the 1950s but I do remember the Cold War and being told that in the event of a nuclear attack, we should huddle under the kitchen table.  In such circumstances, prayer would have been our only hope.  A few years ago a Minister of State saw to it that iodine tablets were delivered to every home in the country.  Such tablets would not have provided much succour in the aftermath of a blast caused by a nuclear missile.  It is good that we have emerged from the difficult period of the Cold War.<\/p><p>  The Civil Defence is currently split into 32 administrative areas.  The Civil Defence Board currently has responsibility for these areas at national level but from now on that responsibility will again reside with the Department.  The Civil Defence grew out of the voluntary air raid protection organisation, which had operated during the Second World War.  It comprises some 6,000 members, all of whom are volunteers.  Many of these individuals work for local authorities and they have made themselves available to deal with very difficult situations such as those caused by flooding.<\/p><p>The duties of Civil Defence include the management of public events, search and rescue, fire-fighting, river rescue, monitoring levels of radiation if necessary and providing assistance to the public during adverse weather events.<\/p><p> Until the move to Roscrea, Ratra House was the home of the Civil Defence from the establishment of the organisation in 1950.  The lodge premises in the Phoenix Park was named by the first President of Ireland, Dr. Douglas Hyde, after his home, Ratra House, in Frenchpark, County Roscommon.  Deputy Calleary will be familiar with Frenchpark as he passes it every second day.  The people of Roscommon are very proud that Douglas Hyde, a great statesman, lived in Ratra House in Frenchpark.<\/p><p> I commend the Civil Defence Board and its committees for their contribution to the ongoing development of civil defence in the past decade.  Their proposals have resulted in the development of the Civil Defence into a highly professional, albeit volunteer group.  Civil Defence training programmes are well supported at local level.  My first encounter with the Civil Defence was the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Knock in 1979, when the personnel of the Civil Defence, the Defence Forces and the FCA provided security and crowd control.  The current level of funding for the Civil Defence will remain at \u20ac5.585 million, even in these straitened times, for which I commend the Minister.  He acknowledges that the service provides value for money.<\/p><p> I am familiar with the work of the Civil Defence in Roscommon and Leitrim.  The personnel are volunteer participants who take great professional pride in their work.  I note the Department has upgraded the equipment available to them and the Civil Defence is the equal of similar organisations in other countries.  I pay tribute to the men and women who provide the service.  The Minister intends to set up a forum of stakeholders to share knowledge and expertise.  The legislation will provide the Civil Defence with the ideal platform to develop as a first-class second-line emergency service.  The voluntary ethos of the organisation is necessary and is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> The Civil Defence Act 2002 transferred responsibility for the governance of the organisation to the Civil Defence Board.  The proposed Bill will not alter the co-operation between the national Civil Defence organisation and the local authorities.  It will transfer the functions and responsibilities back to the Department of Defence.  The Civil Defence uniforms and badges worn by members are internationally recognisable, showing that the organisation is part of a worldwide network of committed people preparing to serve in their own countries and communities or overseas.  There may be a role for overseas involvement by Civil Defence volunteers who could provide assistance in cases of natural disasters.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900025#X00500","speaker":"1085","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354197900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the role of the Civil Defence and its work.  It is appropriate to acknowledge the work of our late colleague S\u00e9amus Brennan, who introduced the 2000 Bill and whose vision for civil defence has resulted in the organisation we know today.  The teams of volunteers and staff around the country work in partnership with the relevant local authorities.  They have expanded the role and the public profile of the organisation to become a front-line community response to crises and a supporting resource for local festivals and events.  The organisation is embedded in the community and this relationship must be retained when the Civil Defence is returned to the Department.  The work of the past decade will be for naught if the link with the community is lost.  I hope that in the construction of the new board there will be a means of measuring the strength of that link.<\/p><p>  The occurrence of bizarre weather events in the recent past, such as flooding and heavy snowfalls, has demonstrated that the Civil Defence operates effectively and in a timely manner.  The organisation is locally based and managed.  It is hoped the response time element will be retained so that the organisation can continue to mobilise its forces in the community as efficiently as possible.  Volunteers can respond to any event in the community within hours.  This is possible because of the local command structure in the organisation.  Deputy Feighan noted the nationwide co-ordination aspect of the organisation.  We must ensure this immediate response to community situations is retained in the new structure.  I welcome the guarantee that the budgetary arrangements for the service will be maintained.  We must ensure that operations and activities account for the bulk of the expenditure rather than administrative functions.  Will the involvement of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency with the Civil Defence organisation be maintained and developed?<\/p><p>  The Civil Defence Officers' Association is represented on the Civil Defence Board.  The association has a strategic input into the running of the organisation.  This input needs to be formalised to allow for some form of representation of Civil Defence officers on the new board.  The Civil Defence is a volunteer organisation and this is the basis of its community focus.  These volunteers need to be represented on the new board to ensure their input is central to the development of the new structure and the ongoing development of civil defence.  There would be no Civil Defence without the volunteers.<\/p><p>That must always be kept in mind.<\/p><p> Recently at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the chairman of the board of the Civil Defence referred to the creation of a very informal forum.  His view on the forum is that it would liaise with and consult interested parties.  Has the Government given that any thought?  Could it formalise the forum to have a required amount of consultation annually or biannually with the various stakeholders in the Civil Defence, who represent community and local authority interests and those involved in emergency planning and services?<\/p><p> I welcome the fact that the Government is retaining the headquarters and keeping the Civil Defence function somewhat separate from the functions of the rest of the Department.  Although the Civil Defence falls within the remit of the Department, it is important that it retain as much autonomy as possible.  It is its own unique community-led organisation.  I welcome the fact that the offices will be retained in Roscrea.<\/p><p> It should be recognised that the Western Brigade of the Defence Forces will be stood down this weekend.  This will end a fantastic link with the west dating from before the foundation of the State.  I thank all those who served in the Western Brigade.  It is unfortunate that its identity has now been lost.  I understand it will be stood down tomorrow evening.<\/p><p> The Civil Defence has considerable opportunities in terms of involving and engaging with communities and attracting more volunteers.  It should become involved with schools, displaying its work and equipment and engaging with transition year students to get them involved at an early age in civil defence, obviously in low-level operations.<\/p><p> We need communities that do not traditionally become involved in civil defence to know that they can become involved.  Part of the budget should be devoted to promoting participation and recruitment.  There are many individuals with skills who now, because of the economic circumstances, have time to participate.  Their skills could be maintained and developed to the benefit of the community.  I encourage the Minister to engage with the new board on promoting the Civil Defence as an outlet for one's skills and talents.<\/p><p> In the past 12 years in Mayo, the Civil Defence has developed phenomenally.  It plays an active and intense role in responding to floods and bad weather conditions, and on unfortunate and tragic occasions it leads the way in search-and-rescue missions, often at short notice and in very difficult circumstances.  We all owe the volunteers a great debt of gratitude.  I hope the new design, while well intended, will not fall short in the implementation.  We have a superb organisation; let us not damage it in the implementation of the plans for the new structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900026#Y00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354198500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time Deputy O'Donovan.<\/p><p>  One must salute the wonderful volunteers who work with the Civil Defence, who were rightly described by another speaker as local heroes.  I welcome the fact that the headquarters will be maintained in Roscrea in County Tipperary.  This is an important, central part of the country that is proud of its volunteers.  The savings being made indicate the Government's determination to cut back on waste.  That is why I welcome the initiative.<\/p><p>  We are all mindful of the work of the Civil Defence.  I refer to volunteerism and supporting local efforts in the wake of floods, freezing temperatures and snowfalls.  For many years the River Suir overflowed in Clonmel in County Tipperary, causing considerable hardship to people in the town.  The Civil Defence sprang into action immediately and helped to alleviate the problem.  Now, owing to considerable investment and work on flood relief in the town, I hope its services will not be needed any more.  Other towns will obviously be subject to flooding; one cannot predict when it will happen.  Where other floods occur, the work of the local Civil Defence will come into play.  The volunteers play a considerable role in improving the quality of life of everybody.<\/p><p>  When the Civil Defence is called upon for local shows, activities and games, the volunteers always oblige.  I am struck at all times by the pride with which they carry out their work.  Day after day, event after event, I see the Civil Defence engage in emergency and support work to back up the Garda, local authorities and others who need it.  This is why I salute the organisation.<\/p><p> The Civil Defence provides stewarding, first-aid cover and other supports at major public and community events.  It supports the front-line ambulance service during environmental and other emergencies and the efforts of local authorities in dealing with all types of emergency.  It cares for displaced people and supports efforts nationwide to combat the spread of infectious animal diseases in support of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  If a national herd is under threat, the Civil Defence will be ready to support the work of the Department's officials.  This is sometimes forgotten when we introduce new legislation in the House.  We must think of the volunteers who are so active.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by the Department of Defence regarding the closure of the barracks in Clonmel.  Some months or a year ago, we received the bad news that Kickham Barracks was to be closed down.  Since then, Department and local authority officials in south Tipperary have made a genuine effort to put a plan together.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, announced in recent weeks that a new Garda station would be built on the site.  There has been widespread negativity over the past 12 months among certain individuals, and false accusations were made that members of the Government parties were standing idly by and doing nothing.  I was pleased some weeks ago when the Minister for Justice and Equality gave his full backing to a proposal, involving the local authority, the VEC and LIT, to put the site to valuable use.  I hope that over the coming years this proposal will be implemented.  The plan is now almost in place.  While one may criticise members of the public service, one must acknowledge this is an example of public servants working together to put a strategic plan in place for the Army barracks site.  It must be acknowledged that it is worthwhile to make the site useful for the taxpayer and convert it into a valuable asset for the town and surrounding area.  I thank the Minister sincerely and am only too glad to put these points on the record.<\/p><p> I am pleased that the Civil Defence headquarters will be in Roscrea and that the new changes will save \u20ac60,000.  That amount may look small but if we can save money in every area in every Department, it will be easier for the Minister for Finance to balance the budget next week and it will not be a struggle to find more taxes and more ways to make life less difficult for people.  The Government parties committed to cut public waste during the election campaign and that is happening, although the pace may be slow.  However, it is worthwhile and we should continue on that track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900027#Z00200","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354199100,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

I acknowledge we have to try to get rid of 14 years of quangos but this is another board that was badly in need of abolition.  What was it set up for in the first place?  The recommendations in the legislation will not change how the Civil Defence operates or administers the functions it carries out effectively around the country.

The \u20ac60,000 saving resulting from this Bill might be small but, as Deputy Tom Hayes said, it is part of an overall package.  Yesterday, we dealt with regulations to downsize political administration.  We will also have fewer VECs, the number of county enterprise boards has reduced and a clatter of other publicly funded organisations are being reformed by being merged, amalgamated or abolished.  It is taking a great deal of time and effort on the part of civil servants, Ministers, Oireachtas committees and parliamentary draftsmen.  The legacy of Fianna F\u00e1il, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Green Party in government is the two years the current Government has had to spend on the \"de-quangoisation\" of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Bill includes a commitment to maintain Civil Defence numbers at their current level of 6,500 but there is scope to do a little more.  Significant emphasis has been put on volunteerism over the past few years.  In 2013, The Gathering will be one of the Government's major initiatives.  The Civil Defence will have an important role to play at events that are planned throughout the country.  Bearing in mind that the population has increased and the number of people, unfortunately, as a result of the economic collapse who have time on their hands and want to put it to good use in their local communities has increased, there might be an opportunity for the Department to increase the strength of the Civil Defence because, at the end of the day, civil defence is not only about people helping their communities but also about developing their personal skills, including leadership.<\/p><p>  Deputy Tom Hayes alluded to the role the Civil Defence will have in the future dealing with natural disasters, emergencies and so on.  It was established in 1950 to provide assurance to the State during the height of the Cold War when nuclear bombs and so on were a threat.  Since then, it has evolved into an organisation that is fit for purpose and it responds quickly and effectively.  Over the past five or six years, there has been a noticeable change in our climate.  One only needs to consider the past summer and the volume of rainfall, which meant land was saturated all the time, channels could not take more water and flooding was a threat.  Going forward, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Civil Defence need to examine whether the capability is available to come to the aid of communities more quickly than is the case currently.  Deluges and flash flooding are becoming regular occurrences.  In 2008, my home town, Newcastlewest, experienced a flash flood and water rose to 20 ft. in a few hours.  A small river, the River Arra, burst its banks and, within a few hours, an air sea rescue helicopter was hovering over the town and Civil Defence boats were on the streets.  That is not the image we want to see but it is important that the capability, infrastructure and local volunteer network is in place.<\/p><p>  I refer to Deputy \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl's proposal.  The Civil Defence has a strong relationship with local authorities, as much of its capital expenditure derives from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In many cases, Civil Defence officers, including my own in Limerick - Mr. Jos Kirby - are based in local authority offices and, therefore, they have a ready made link to the Department.  As reform evolves, the Minister might consider more devolution into the local authority structure from the Department of Defence to give chief executive officers and local authority members a role in setting targets for the Civil Defence.  The organisation will be party to the formulation of major emergency plans for local authorities, which is positive, but local authority members, engineers and local gangers on the roads have the knowledge about where flooding is likely and so on.  It is on that basis that the organisation might migrate in the long term into the local authority structure.<\/p><p>  A sum of \u20ac60,000 is 1% of the overall budget but the Government is progressing with the &quot;de-quangoisation&quot; of the country and trying to restore a semblance of accountability.  Restoring the Civil Defence to the Department of Defence begs the question: why was it moved out of there in the first place?  Given this will happen, we must examine whether greater efficiencies can be made.  My sole criticism of the Government parties is that they are not getting the message out about the number of quangos that have been changed in a short time.  Last year, I tabled parliamentary questions to every Minister to elicit the number of quangos, State boards and talking shops in one form or another that had been abolished, merged or subsumed and there was a huge number.  A review of the reforms that are being made should be carried out on an annual basis by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> I pay tribute to the Civil Defence in my own county.  Given the local authorities in Limerick are being merged, as they are in Tipperary, the organisation will face a challenge in the county, no more than the fire service and other emergency services provided by the two local authorities.  However, there is potential for greater synergies between the fire and emergency services and the Civil Defence and to subsume them into a more integrated, responsible and accountable local authority system.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900028#AA00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1354199700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members who contributed to this debate.  Everyone praised the work done by the Civil Defence across the country.  As I stated in my opening remarks, it is intended that this Bill will return the management, development and administration of the Civil Defence to the Department of Defence.  In the day-to-day running of the organisation and for the volunteer on the ground, the basic structure of the Civil Defence will remain the same.  That was a concern for several Members.  The only change to the Civil Defence is the dissolution of its board, while its management will be brought into the Department of Defence.  A forum will be established with representatives from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, county managers, Civil Defence officers and volunteers and the Department of Defence.  Civil Defence officers and volunteers from all local authorities and local areas will have a voice in this proposed forum.  The concerns of every volunteer on the ground will be listened to.<\/p><p>  The Bill is a major advance for the Civil Defence and represents a sensible and practical model for its operation in the years ahead.

In County Wexford, I am very much aware of the amount of work Civil Defence volunteers do on the ground.

It is necessary to raise the issue because the approval of projects under the Leader element of the rural development programme has been suspended at the Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company.  This follows an ongoing investigation into the Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company.<\/p><p>  Leader funding has played an important function in the economic and social development of rural Ireland in the lifetime of the funding.  It supports hundreds of jobs, some 300 jobs in the case of the Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company.  It sustains communities and it is needed now more than ever because of the difficult times.  We hear a good deal about how rural communities are suffering and about services being withdrawn.  Leader funding is crucial in this regard.  The funding comes from Europe but the tap has been turned off and there has been a detrimental effect on various applications in the north and east Mayo areas.  I am aware of a grant that has been approved for a youth cafe in Ballyhaunis, while applications relating to the Seosamh Mac Gabhann summer school in Kilmovee, the John Healy weekend in Charlestown and a community centre in Kilkelly have been delayed.  This week I was contacted by Ballina Town Council, which expressed its concern at the suspension of funding.  There is a mystery or cloud about it and it is important that clarity is provided.  This is the reason I am raising the matter today.  In addition, rumour and innuendo have been doing the rounds about why the investigation was requested, by whom and why it is taking so long.  This is really why I need clarity today.<\/p><p>  The big issue is funding.  Projects worth almost \u20ac2 million are either in the pipeline or ready to be applied for in this region.  Approved projects must be paid out while others must be applied for, approved and allocated before the end of 2013.  The important thing is that funding is not lost to the region.  Everyone understands that there must be strict rules and guidelines and that these must be transparent and above board.  The whole affair has dragged on.  I am keen to know when the investigation will be completed or, if it is complete, what was the outcome and when will funding be restored to the projects that have been approved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900030#CC00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1354200000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Funding of \u20ac314 million is available under the Leader elements of the rural development programme for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  There are 35 local action groups or Leader companies contracted on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to deliver the rural development programme throughout the country.  These groups are the principal decision-makers in respect of the allocation of this funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with the operating rules and EU guidelines.<\/p><p>  Currently, Leader activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the Leader companies and that the conduct of these companies must be shown to be beyond reproach.  Furthermore, the conduct and constitution of the companies must be in accordance with the corporate governance guidelines.  These guidelines are designed to assist the companies, sectors and pillars that are involved in supporting and promoting social, enterprise and community development at local level.  The provision of public funding to such companies imposes national and EU obligations on the Department to ensure that there is transparency in the receipt, administration and disbursement of such funds.  It is essential that the companies are governed by appropriate standards which provide the companies, their directors and other stakeholders, such as the public, the Department and the EU, with a reasonable assurance with regard to the governance arrangements in place.<\/p><p>  Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company is the local action group contracted by the Department to deliver both the rural development programme and the local community development programme to the north Mayo area.  On foot of correspondence received in 2011 by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, regarding a possible governance issue at Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company, the Minister directed his Department to investigate the matter.

However, I regret he is not here to take this matter.  I am from Mayo, where Ireland West Airport Knock is located.  I am gravely concerned for the future of this airport in light of the announcement earlier this year with regard to the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and its amalgamation with Shannon Development, the purpose of which is to make Shannon Airport self-financing.  We know that Shannon Airport operates at a significant operational loss year-on-year, to the tune of \u20ac8 million.  Shannon Airport is key to the future development of the mid-west region.  Knock airport, which serves the west and north-west regions, is equally significant, if not more so.  Knock airport is a success story.  The Minister should not be making decisions which have an anti-competitive effect on Knock airport and ultimately undermine its future viability.  The airport operates on a shoestring budget.  The three State airports should be benchmarked against Knock airport for efficiencies.  <\/p><p>  Knock airport was established in 1985 by Monsignor James Horan, whose mantle has been taken up by the trusteeship under which Knock operates and by the people of the area.  Some 680,000 passengers will pass through Knock airport this year.  Five major airlines serve 25 international routes from the airport.  All of this is being done without the financial and regulatory focus the Government has on the State airports.  Knock airport does not need to be undermined.  The Minister is on the record as saying that it is a role model in terms of efficiencies, how to do business in aviation and how to be competitive and succeed.  There is a great emotional attachment to Knock airport in the region, which, more than any other region in the country, has suffered mass emigration.  For many years our diaspora were in the international sphere but we were not internationally accessible.  However, that was before the construction of Knock airport.<\/p><p>  The Minister has stated on many occasions that any development of Knock airport is a matter for the management of the airport because it is a privately owned entity.  This is his reason for not having a plan for Knock airport.  I do not accept that.  Knock airport is run as a trusteeship.  Its stated objective is the social and economic development of the region.  Unlike any other airport in this country, Knock airport has been funded to the tune of \u20ac26 million by the people of the region and its diaspora.  It is owned by the people and should be supported into the future.  It is a red herring to suggest that this is the reason something cannot be done for Knock airport.<\/p><p>  The concerns of the management of Knock airport need to be taken seriously and a plan for the future growth of the airport needs to be worked out.  It must be given the same focus shown to Shannon.  As a peripheral area competing in a global village for business and tourism, Mayo cannot afford to have its airport undermined going forward.  I do not wish to play any part in putting the final nail in the coffin of Knock airport.  This problem will not go away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900031#DD00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1354200600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I am taking this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  Since his appointment, the Minister has set out to rationalise the system of State support for the privately owned regional airports.  The Government now has a settled policy with regard to these airports.  The Minister has also endeavoured to restructure the State-owned airports and, in particular, to map out the best future for Shannon Airport.  All Irish airports should operate to a commercial mandate and the Minister has stressed in the past that regional airports, including Knock airport, must work towards achieving operational viability over the near term.  This also applies to the three State Airports.  This aim is particularly acute in the current difficult financial and economic situation in which the country finds itself.<\/p><p>  Next week, the Minister for Finance will announce budget measures to achieve a further \u20ac3.5 billion in savings through expenditure cuts and revenue-raising initiatives.  The State has recognised that the six privately owned airports needed financial assistance with their capital and operational costs and substantial amounts of taxpayers' money has been disbursed to them over the years to support their operations, but this could not go on indefinitely.  To ensure best use of scarce Exchequer resources, it has already been necessary to cease all funding for the two airports in Galway and Sligo.  Subject to funding availability, the other four airports, including Knock, will continue to be eligible for funding up to the end of 2014.  In this regard, approval was secured from the European Commission in 2011 to extend the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's capital expenditure grant scheme for three years to 2014.  It is in this context that all airports must work towards sustainability over the coming years, without an ongoing need for Government subvention.  Capital funding for these four airports is focused on safety and security projects aimed at ensuring they can comply with the latest national and international aviation safety and security standards.  Current funding is split between subvention for PSO air services between Dublin and the two most remote regional airports, Donegal and Kerry, and operational subvention towards the cost of providing core airport services at these airports.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following the Government decision last May to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority group and merge it with a restructured Shannon Development to create a new entity, a steering group of senior officials from five key Departments was established to introduce proposals for the implementation of that decision.  The steering group was assisted by two task forces, which submitted their reports for consideration by the steering group earlier this month.<\/p><p>On the basis of the work undertaken by the task force and the steering group, detailed proposals on the restructuring of the State airports and Shannon Development have been submitted to the Government by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  An announcement will be made about this shortly.  The task force made a submission to the Department of Finance in the context of the forthcoming budget and it is understood that it suggested a range of potential nationally available incentives that could be considered in support of aviation development in this country.  However, as the Deputy is aware, budgetary matters are an issue for the Minister for Finance.  Aviation is a key component of all major forms of economic activity in Ireland, in our tourism as well as our business sectors.  The measures being taken are based on increasing the overall number of passengers to and from Ireland through increased efficiencies and attracting new aviation business that can have a beneficial national impact.  The Minister believes that these measures will form the basis for sound, sustainable airport businesses into the future that will support the growth of these sectors and help drive Ireland's economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900031#DD00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354201200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I find the rationale operating here amazing.  We have an airport in Shannon that has been haemorrhaging money.  I have no issue with helping out Shannon Airport but I do have an issue with the Government putting at risk an airport that is doing its best on a shoestring budget by intervening in another State airport.  I have consistently asked questions about the anti-competitive effect of decisions made in respect of Shannon Airport but have received no answer.  If I am asking these questions, the Minister of State can only imagine what the trustees and staff of Knock airport are wondering.  I have asked whether there has been any liaison with the European authorities regarding competition law and whether the Government's intervention falls foul of this, but the silence has been deafening.  No concrete information is forthcoming, despite the fact that a decision about one airport is having massive ramifications for another.<\/p><p>  This situation requires a lot more joined-up thinking, because I cannot see any clear Government airport policy.  Before proceeding with the preferred approach for the separation of the Dublin Airport Authority, would it not benefit the Government to clarify its airport objectives?  The Government must clarify its desired level of airport competition for the country as a whole, as well as among the current DAA airports.  Is it just going to ignore the West as a region?  Is it acceptable that we all go to Shannon Airport and undermine Knock airport?  I do not think that is acceptable.  It is not fair to hide behind the fact that the DAA airports are State airports.  Knock airport is a public airport, owned by the people of the area in trust; that is the way it was set up.  A lack of consideration of Knock airport by the Government will not wash, because it has the potential to be a strategic aviation hub for us.  Without it, the west will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of business and tourism.  This matter must be addressed.  The issues surrounding competition and the possible illegality of some of the moves the Government appears to be planning must be addressed.  Some consolation must be given to Knock airport in this regard and some plan must be drawn up for the airport and for the people of the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900032#EE00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1354201200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Mulherin that we need a plan for Knock airport and the region, given the importance of the airport to the entire region in terms of tourism and business development.

In any event, I wish to know the up-to-date position regarding the reason for non-payment to third year DIT biomedical science students of the monthly training allowance payable to them while on placement in public health service laboratories.  I am raising this on behalf of current and former students of biomedical science at DIT Kevin Street, who used to be paid a monthly allowance for the period of their third year full-time placement, which involves training in public health service laboratories in hospitals.  Payment of this allowance was stopped three years ago on the grounds of HSE cutbacks.  However, although biomedical science is offered at three third level colleges - namely, DIT, NUI Galway and Cork University - and students of those courses had all previously received the allowance, it was stopped only for the DIT students.  Students at the other two colleges still receive the allowance and have done so over the past three years.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is also worth noting that the Department of Health and Children document on consolidated salary scales for new entrants, effective from 1 January 2011, states that the third year student medical scientist monthly training allowance is &#8364;813.58.  I am aware that when the allowance was stopped, the issue was raised on behalf of the students by the Medical Laboratory Scientists' Association and, as I mentioned earlier, I have raised it in a number of parliamentary questions, starting in February of this year.  I have since put other parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health on this matter, the last of which was in September.  I have also written to the Minister on the issue a number of times.  In response to my question in February, the Minister stated the following:<blockquote>Student medical scientists who are in their third year of study and who are accepted for a clinical placement in a public health service laboratory are eligible to receive a monthly training allowance of &#8364;813.58.  I am making inquiries about the particular issue raised by the Deputy and will correspond with her on the matter as soon as possible.<\/blockquote>I have sent a number of follow-up letters to the Minister as well as tabling several parliamentary questions, and in his responses he has told me the matter is receiving attention.  It is important that this matter is resolved.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is also noteworthy that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in its review of allowances, makes reference to the monthly training allowance paid to third year medical science students.

These placements build on the academic training received in colleges and universities and provide students with practical experience of a health service working environment.  Clinical placements ensure that graduates are then in a better position to take up employment following graduation. Some placements involve the payment of a salary or allowance, while others do not.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for a payment to student medical scientists undertaking clinical placement in hospitals were put in place in the 1980s.  These arrangements applied to all hospitals where such placements occur.  I understand that in recent years a number of hospitals in the Dublin area discontinued this payment to student medical scientists, primarily on cost grounds.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is currently examining this issue with a view to determining which hospitals are involved and the number of students affected.  This process will be concluded shortly.  It will then inform a decision with regard to future payment of this allowance in the hospitals concerned.  Here is the old official line: it would not be appropriate for the Minister or for me to prejudge the outcome of this process.  However, the Department of Health has assured me there will be no undue delays in dealing with the matter and that the HSE will be communicating with the hospitals concerned in the very near future.<\/p><p> Deputy Tuffy made a compelling case which cut through the verbiage that one regularly hears on these matters.  The HSE needs to get its act together because clearly there is a disparity in the payments issued by the various colleges and hospitals.  I am informed by another note that the Department has emphasised to the HSE the need to resolve this issue in light of the fact that the Deputy previously raised it in a parliamentary question as long ago as last year.  The fact that it has taken this long to come up with a convincing argument on payments dating back to 1981 suggests a certain inadequacy in decision making, if that is not too bold a comment to make.  I understand the Department has asked the HSE to clarify the issue and the latter is investigating which hospitals are involved and the number of students affected.

The students work full-time when they are on placement in hospitals.  As a result of the allowance for DIT students, many are required to take on part-time employment in addition to their full-time placements.  Clearly, that undermines their ability to work to their full capacity in the hospitals concerned.  The Department of Health has stated that the allowance is payable and, similarly, student environmental health officers receive a weekly payment while on placement.  Other students such as student nurses are paid substantially more.  If the Department sets an allowance, surely it is not for the hospitals themselves to decide whether to pay it.  This is an unfair anomaly and it is important that it be addressed.  The issue of back-pay also arises for students who did not receive the allowance and as a result incurred significant costs.

In 2009, the Dublin hospitals that received students from DIT decided to discontinue the payment, but that is not applicable to other hospitals around the country.  There is a clear disparity and this is why the Minister has asked for a thorough examination of the issue and a report from the HSE with credible answers and proposals for addressing it.  I hope that as a consequence of Deputy Tuffy's raising the issue the students will get answers at the earliest opportunity.

The final report of the national narcolepsy study steering committee was published on 19 April 2012.  The report was commissioned following concerns about an increase in narcolepsy among those who were administered the swine flu vaccine Pandemrix.  The report found that the risk of narcolepsy was 13 times higher among those given the swine flu vaccine than in unvaccinated individuals.  At the time of the epidemic, approximately 900,000 people were vaccinated.  The report states that symptoms developed between two weeks and 20 months after vaccination and there was increased risk of narcolepsy among young people aged between five and 19 years.<\/p><p>  Inevitably, a campaign group was set up to represent families who believe their children have been affected.  The group, which is called Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder, SOUND, represents more than 30 children and their parents.  SOUND has been seeking health and educational supports, as well as a compensation programme.  I raise this matter on behalf of the group and I am aware that other Deputies have also raised it by means of parliamentary questions.  Correspondence received by my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, from the parent of a sufferer describes the difficulties that arise.  The correspondence states that the final report of the national narcolepsy study steering committee concluded that the higher incidence of narcolepsy among children and adolescents was associated with vaccination with Pandemrix.  The Minister for Health subsequently gave a clear commitment to the members of SOUND that a paper would be presented to the Government prior to the previous summer recess to propose a package of supports for those affected.  SOUND was later advised that the paper had been delayed but would be put to the D\u00e1il in September 2012.  It was then delayed until October.  The most recent communication with SOUND is that a statement will be made by the Minister in the next four to six weeks, with no mention of the proposed paper or further consultation with SOUND.  The parent was most disappointed at the lack of follow-up by the Minister and was concerned for the future of his teenage daughter.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the children's referendum, children with narcolepsy due to a State-sponsored vaccination programme appear to have been forgotten.  What does this say about the Government's commitment to children?  The correspondent's daughter was vaccinated against the H1N1 virus in November 2009 and, following 18 months of fear, anxiety and misdiagnosis, was conclusively diagnosed with narcolepsy as a result of the vaccination.<\/p><p>This means that for this family the journey began three years ago.  The chronic condition is not curable and is managed with lifetime medication, with only limited success.  The daughter suffers constantly from narcolepsy and frequently also suffers cataplexy attacks - complete loss of muscle tone - and has recently begun to experience disturbing night terrors.  Her quality of life and her ability to fulfil her potential in sport, education and normal social behaviour have all been dramatically diminished by this terrible consequence of the State-promoted vaccination programme.  The quality of life of her siblings has also been adversely affected by her condition, as has normal family life.  The parent believes that the Minister, his Department and the HSE are reneging on their collective duty and, in particular, on the Minister's personal commitment to this child and the other children, adolescents and young adults, to meet the needs of their particular circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900033#FF00400","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354202400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl for raising this and for providing me with the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, to outline to the House the importance of the issue raised.<\/p><p>  The Minister's priority is to ensure that the children and adolescents affected are provided with services and supports to meet their health and medical needs.

I understand the memorandum will set out all of the issues in terms of additional supports required for those affected by narcolepsy.  I also understand the memorandum requires the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that the Department of Health and Children is in contact with the relevant officials in the Department.  As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I assure the Deputy that I will raise this matter not only with the Minister for Health and Children but also with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  It seems that in order for a memorandum to come to the Government setting out additional supports for these people, it requires the approval of both of these Ministers, as these supports will require additional funding.  I will raise the issue with both Ministers.<\/p><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 to 83, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that it does not track the number of borrowers falling within the MARP process but does track the number of alternative arrangements, and the nature of the arrangement, put in place across the regulated industry and which is published quarterly by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the current version of which came into effect from 1 January 2011, was issued under the provisions of section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The Code applies to the mortgage lending activities of all entities regulated by the Central Bank, except for credit unions, in respect of loans which are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence.  The Code sets out the framework within which a regulated mortgage lender must engage with a borrower who is in arrears, or pre-arrears, in respect of a loan secured on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence and who is co-operating with the lender.<\/p><p>This revised Code sets out new and more detailed requirements that a lender must comply with when dealing with mortgage holders experiencing genuine arrears and financial difficulties.  In particular, it provides that each lender must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and use this framework when dealing with its mortgage holders experiencing difficulty.  This framework provides for a number of steps such as:<\/p><p> - communication with borrowers;<\/p><p> - the use of a standard financial statement to obtain financial information;<\/p><p> - assessment of the customer&#8217;s circumstances by dedicated arrears support units;<\/p><p> - resolution, which require the lender to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement in order to determine the most viable option in each case, and<\/p><p> - an appeals process, which initially will be an internal Appeals Board within the institution, to reconsider the matter if the borrower is not satisfied with the proposed resolution response.  There is then the further option if necessary, to appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman after the internal appeal process has ended.<\/p><p>MARP, therefore, is not a scheme as such but rather is a process put in place to govern the interaction between mortgage borrower and lender in circumstances where the former is experiencing genuine difficulty and allows both parties to assess the current situation with a view to coming to an optimal solution.  In particular, a lender is required to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement to determine which options are viable for each particular case.<\/p><p>Other protections offered to borrowers under the CCMA include the following:<\/p><p> - all cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender;<\/p><p> - a lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower;<\/p><p> - where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least 12 months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the courts to commence legal action;<\/p><p> - each branch or office of the lender must have one person responsible for dealing with borrowers in difficulty and must also have a dedicated Arrears Support Unit to deal with all MARP cases;<\/p><p> - lenders are restricted from imposing charges on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears where the borrower is co-operating with the lender;<\/p><p> - all communications about arrears and pre-arrears must be provided in a timely, clear and consumer friendly manner, e.g. information booklet providing details of MARP and dedicated section on website. <\/p><p>Quarter 2 2012 Mortgage Arrears Stats published in August shows the number of mortgages secured on Private Dwelling Homes (PDH&#8217;s) which are in arrears. This is also broken down into restructured number and type.  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.  The publication of Quarter 3 data is expected in mid-December, will also include information on Buy to Let properties for the first time.<\/p><p>Regarding complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman, I am informed by that Office that it introduced a policy last April in response to a number of complaints being submitted to his Office regarding mortgage arrears\/pre arrears, to deal with such cases. This policy states that a complainant must first engage with the financial institution in question and fully exhaust the MARP process. The Financial Services Ombudsman will not investigate such complaints where the MARP process has not been exhausted. This gives both parties the opportunity to re-engage with the process and find, where possible, an alternative resolution.  If a complainant uses the MARP process, with either party failing to come to a resolution, the complainant can revert back to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  In that regard, the above procedure has proved relatively successful as it ensures that the respective parties engage with one another, before referral to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. However, there have been cases where MARP has been exhausted, and the Ombudsman followed up by investigating such complaints.  Thus far, there have been 6 not upheld, with 5 partly upheld. There have been no cases where the Ombudsman fully upheld such a complaint.<\/p><p>The Central Bank also informed me that a review of lenders compliance with the CCMA was carried out by it in 2011, focussing on charges imposed by lenders. Please see a link to the Press Release on the outcome of this review below.  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p>Also attached, for information, is a link to the CCMA and the Central Bank&#8217;s Consumer Guide to dealing with your lender below.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that it will commence a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the first quarter of 2013.   The Central Bank would normally conduct a review following a reasonable time after implementation and the Code will require updating due to the introduction of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement insolvency framework as provided for in the Personal Insolvency Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas as well as longer term mortgage resolution options.  The review will take into consideration recent developments that may be relevant to the issue of mortgage arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900034#GG00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1354203000,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900035#HH00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","time":1354203000,"counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900035#HH00150"},{"type":"question","time":1354203000,"counter":282,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[53547\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900035#HH00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the need to ensure that energy prices are kept under review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I have no statutory function in the setting of gas or electricity prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of these markets.

The changes taking place and the lack of certainty seem to be impacting on the level of confidence in the scheme.  For example, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of calls and inquiries to theSustainable Energy Authority of Ireland from some 500 to 100 a day.  This suggests something to us.  The absence of continuity and certainty in transitioning from one scheme to another is impacting on people's ability to plan to employ themselves in this market.  Is all of the \u20ac76 million committed to be drawn down this year?  Does the Minister have information readily available on how many grants this sum would cover?

However, she is wrong in somehow persuading herself, as she has done in the question, that it is due to a lack of continuity.  Whatever it is, it is not due to a lack of continuity and it is not the case that the pay-as-you-save scheme was ready before we went into government.<\/p><p>The scheme is still not ready.  It is a complex issue.  In any event, we did not want it to be ready because we are still operating a grants-based incentive scheme for people to insulate and retrofit their homes so they make energy savings, and as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, that they can live in their homes with more comfort.  I accept the grant was moderated this year, but it was done because the price of doing that kind of job is now less than it was three to five years ago.  We are trying to ensure that the money goes as far as possible.  I remind the House that I invested an additional \u20ac30 million into the scheme last year.  Far from cutting it, we put in \u20ac30 million extra in the jobs initiative in the middle of last year.

That is her net point.  I am interested in it too.  I find it difficult to come up with experts who can provide a reason.  Two major reasons have been advanced.  The first is that last year there was a particularly mild winter.  Anytime there is a particularly harsh winter such as the two previous ones, there is a spike in demand and then it falls off.  The second reason is the recessionary climate where people are reluctant to put their hand in their pocket.  Even if one gets grant funding one still has to fund the work by a factor of 2:1.  If one gets a grant, for example of \u20ac4,000, one is expected to come up with \u20ac7,000 or \u20ac8,000 to do the job.  In the present climate people are reluctant to spend that kind of money.  That is one of the advantages of the pay-as-you-save scheme.  The idea of the pay-as-you-save scheme is that householders are not expected to put money upfront.

As a result of targeted Government interventions through initiatives such as the national broadband scheme, basic broadband services are now widely available across the country.  In addition, the State-funded metropolitan area networks, MANs, are available in approximately 94 centres, including a number of small rural towns and they help facilitate the roll-out of higher speed broadband in these centres.  The challenge now is to accelerate the roll-out of high speed services to all areas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The national broadband plan, which I launched in August last, aims to change radically the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  These ambitious targets apply to the entire country, including hard-to-reach rural areas.  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention confined to areas where the market is unlikely to invest.<\/p><p><br \/>  The national broadband plan contains actions for investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30 Mbps and 40 Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete.  It will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure the Government&#8217;s commitment that a minimum of 30 Mbps be available throughout the country is realised.  It is also expected that the spectrum rights in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz released following ComReg&#8217;s recent auction will play an important role in helping achieve these goals.  The leveraging of this spectrum will be particularly important in radically improving mobile broadband speeds.  In summary I can assure the Deputy that through implementation of the national broadband plan I am committed to tackling the digital divide decisively and to ensuring that much higher speed broadband is available in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900037#KK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1354204200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>My question relates to the schools broadband initiative.

The outcome of the auction for this spectrum was announced by ComReg on Thursday, 15 November.  The auction raised some \u20ac855 million, of which at least \u20ac400 million is expected to accrue to the Exchequer in 2012.  Apart from this outstanding financial outcome, the new spectrum will enable the widespread availability of much faster mobile broadband through 4G services.  This is extremely important from a broadband policy viewpoint.  In the national broadband plan which I published in August the Government committed to the provision of high-speed broadband, including a commitment of the availability of 30 Mbps to all premises in the State within the lifetime of the Government.  Mobile broadband via 4G services is expected to play a key role in meeting this commitment, especially in rural areas.  It is, therefore, of crucial importance that 4G services should have broad countrywide coverage.<\/p><p>  It was a condition stipulated by ComReg that in respect of population coverage on services offered by the winning operators, all licence holders would have to attain and maintain a minimum coverage of 70% of the population and would have to do so within three years.  In fact, ComReg considers that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed the obligation in this regard by a considerable margin, particularly in the light of the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  It should also be noted that coverage continues to be an important differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market such that any material deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine its attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.  Furthermore, the coverage proposals set were designed to ensure cherry-picking of high density urban areas would not occur.<\/p><p>  In terms of the experience to date, it should be noted that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their current respective licences.  For example, for 3G services, Vodafone's coverage covers 90% of the population or 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as 3, covers 96% of the population or 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers over 90% of the population, which is more than its obligation.  Comments by the service providers in the wake of the recent auction have confirmed their commitment to investment to leverage the spectrum allocation to maximum effect.  This also indicates that the maximum coverage requirements will be exceeded.<\/p><p>  The precise geographic breakdown of 4G services will, of course, be a matter for each service provider.  I am, however, confident, based on the 70% requirement figure, previous experience and the statements already made by the winning bidders, that 4G services will be widely available throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900039#MM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1354205400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>More often than not, this Chamber hears about issues which have not been dealt with rather than those which have been resolved.  The issue relating to the 4G network is again one which relates to the urban-rural divide.  The obligation in this regard is that providers must reach 70% of the population with their services.  One could argue that the most densely populated areas of the country are in the east and that it would be quite easy to meet the obligation in these areas.  I understand the authorities in the United Kingdom, when carrying out their auction, stipulated that operators should seek to reach 98% of the public in towns and villages, not just in large urban areas.  I am concerned that we will again end up with an urban-rural divide in this matter or that there will be no coverage at extremely remote locations.  There have been massive improvements in technology in recent years, but there are still vast areas of this country in which operators have not been able to provide coverage.

I do not believe I am misrepresenting ComReg which made this decision when I say that ideally it would be of the view that in a competitive marketplace there would be no requirement to stipulate a figure.  The 70% population obligation figure is a stratagem which was deliberately designed to avoid cherry-picking.  It will prevent a new entrant from outside from cherry-picking the most populous parts of urban areas and providing services therein.  The requirement to cover 70% of the population means such behaviour will be ruled out.<\/p><p>  The Government is delighted not only by the fact that \u20ac855 million was raised from the auction - in current circumstances this money is obviously very welcome - but also that four major bidders are competing in the market.

The study looked at the impact of wind on the electricity market, including the impact on the operational requirements of the thermal generation.  It shows that wind did not add any additional cost to the price of electricity.  While constraint costs increased slightly in the scenario with more wind power, this was more than offset by the reduction in overall production costs.  Constraints were estimated to add about 1% to total costs in the wind scenario but the fossil fuel offset by wind generation reduced total costs by around 12% in the same scenario.<\/p><p><br \/>  When the cost of the public service obligation supports for wind energy is accounted for, there was no material cost difference between the scenarios with and without wind.  <font color=\"#212100\">The analysis showed that wind generation lowers wholesale prices by &#8364;74 million which almost exactly offsets the costs of the PSO levy and other costs associated with the generation of wind energy.  The study clearly demonstrates that wind energy did not contribute to higher wholesale electricity prices on the Irish electricity system in 2011.<\/font><\/p><p><br \/>  In any given year, the relative effect of renewable electricity on final prices depends to a considerable degree on the cost of alternatives.  This is particularly the case with gas prices because gas is the single biggest fuel used for electricity generation in Ireland.  Wind power shows the greatest relative economic advantage when gas prices are high.  When gas prices are in the medium to high range, wind power tends to lower electricity prices.  Thus, wind can be seen as a hedge against high gas prices.  Natural gas prices in Ireland have increased by over 60% since 2009.  Projections for future gas prices by the International Energy Agency and the EU Commission show that further growth in gas prices of up to 30% is likely in the next decade.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>Wind energy lowers wholesale electricity prices because of its near zero short-term running costs, displacing the most expensive form of generation that would otherwise be used in the wholesale market.  It adds to retail prices through market payments associated with wind power, principally the PSO levy that funds the REFIT, renewable energy feed in tariff, payments.  The balance of these two determines the final impact of electricity prices.<\/p><p><br \/>  The independent electricity transmission system operators, TSOs, in Ireland and Northern Ireland, EirGrid and SONI, have carried out technical studies and analysis of the all-island system over the past number of years.  The results of these studies can be found in the reports entitled respectively, Facilitation of Renewables and Ensuring a Secure, Reliable and Efficient Power System in a Changing Environment.  These reports are published on the EirGrid website.  However, the key messages from these studies are that the 40% 2020 renewable targets set by Governments in Ireland and Northern Ireland are achievable, notwithstanding that significant challenges to the operation of the system will have to be overcome.<\/p><p><br \/>  To manage the achievement of these targets over the coming years, EirGrid and SONI have established a programme of work entitled Delivering a Secure Sustainable Electricity System, DS3.

A number of organisations are providing details on progress in this regard.  This week, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, published its 2012 report Energy in Ireland.  The total use of renewables in Ireland almost trebled between 2003 and 2011.  The report showed that, in 2011, Ireland had 17.6% renewable electricity, 2.6% renewable transport and 4.8% renewable heating, meaning that, in total, 6% of all energy consumed was from renewable sources.  Other bodies, such as EirGrid and ESB Networks, report on matters such as daily wind energy penetration and grid connection issues.<\/p><p>  To meet our current energy demands, we are importing around 90% of our required fuel.  This is at a cost of approximately \u20ac6 billion per annum.  Developing renewable sources of energy will help Ireland to meet our 2020 targets and to reduce our dependence on these fuel imports by replacing them with indigenous resources.  Ireland has renewable energy infrastructure generating approximately 2000 MW connected to the electricity grid.  To meet our renewable electricity targets for 2020, it is estimated that a further 2000 MW of renewables will be required.<\/p><p>  In addition to achieving this ambitious target, a significant challenge will be to ensure we are able to build the necessary supporting grid infrastructure to accept new renewable generation, which is typically in more remote areas that have weak grid systems.  Our ability to get this infrastructure built is critical to achieving our renewable energy ambitions.  In this regard, EirGrid\u2019s GRID25 strategy and implementation plans are designed to deliver the necessary grid developments and reinforcements to underpin the new renewable generating capacity, in addition to regional economic development.<\/p><p>  To incentivise the development of renewable electricity, a feed-in tariff scheme is in place.  Renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, which was introduced in 2006 for wind-sourced generation, small hydro, landfill gas and biomass-generated electricity, operates by guaranteeing a minimum floor price for renewable energy generation over a 15-year period.  In order to accelerate the uptake of renewables, two new REFIT schemes were introduced in 2012.  The first, REFIT 3, is to encourage biomass-sourced generation, and the second is to encourage further wind-sourced generation into addition to generation from small hydro and landfill gas.  The REFIT schemes are funded through the PSO levy that is funded by all electricity consumers.<\/p><p>REFIT 3 is designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity capacity to the Irish electricity grid.  The technologies supported include anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power, which will also contribute to our renewable heat targets.  It also contains incentives for cofiring of biomass in peat powered generation plants with a premium for the use of energy crops.  REFIT 3 will, over time, create further demand for biomass, which will provide new opportunities in the biomass sector and encourage the establishment of new rural enterprises.<\/p><p> The electricity market is fully liberalised and decisions to participate in the scheme are commercial for the individual electricity generating companies involved. I am informed by my Department that there has been significant interest in the REFIT 3 scheme and letters of offer have been given for approximately 44 MW of generation with a similar amount under consideration.  Other developers are at earlier stages of development with their projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900041#OO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354207200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>A number of people have invested in miscanthus or elephant grass, as it is most commonly known.
