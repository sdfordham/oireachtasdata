I tried to get this issue addressed in the first instance a few years ago by getting the evidence and giving it to the Minister in the hope that it would be included in an amendment to another Bill, but that has not been forthcoming.  As a consequence, I decided to table this Bill.  It is very simple.  It is about how the definition in the Multi-Unit Developments Act is being interpreted.  It will cause problems if it is not redefined in a way that was intended in the Multi-Unit Developments Bill, as originally proposed, which was subsequently amended in the Seanad.  That change in the definition has caused the problem.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011 or 2012 I was advised of a housing development in Celbridge consisting of nine houses.  The solicitor advised the council when the planning application was being made that there was an obligation to set up a management company for the development.  There were no apartments or duplexes, only nine terraced houses.  The council spoke to the solicitor and it was advised that it was contrary to the county plan and Government policy as set out in a Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government circular.  When I alerted the Minister I was asked to provide some information and I got a letter from Kildare County Council.  The then Minister, Deputy Shatter, agreed to liaise with other local authorities to see if the same thing was occurring.  I have heard nothing since even though I have made inquiries by way of parliamentary question and so on.  It is about how this is interpreted and the Bill suggests a different interpretation.<\/p>  <p>  In the early 2000s we started to see management companies typically being included in planning applications.  They vary in type from a management company that has a lien on a property to something that is less difficult to untangle.  The Multi-Unit Developments Act was introduced on foot of a Law Reform Commission report.  Many people were complaining - I am quite sure the Minister of State knows this because it would have been typical practice in our constituency - that they arrived at their solicitor's office and the solicitor said, \"This is just a requirement.  Sign this or you don't get your keys.\"  They did not realise that there was a recurring cost every year in the form of management company fees.  These were not people buying apartments but people buying houses.  It may well have been a mixed development and there may well have been some apartments within that.  The Multi-Unit Developments Act was intended to apply some legal arrangements to multi-unit developments of apartments or where there were shared internal spaces such as lifts or common areas that had to be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  There are all sorts of problems in that.  It created a new bill, which in some cases was equivalent to another month's mortgage.  When estates were being taken into charge there was a doubt over whether this could proceed if there was a dual responsibility with the local authority on one side and a management company on the other side.  I am essentially trying to undo these.  I have approximately a dozen examples, each of which is constructed differently.<\/p>  <p>  I got legal advice on how to wind down a management company in order that I could give some generic advice to people who found themselves in that position, particularly but not exclusively in my constituency.  It is quite an onerous task.  In some cases the management companies have ceased to exist because they have not complied with company law and have been struck off.  It causes all sorts of problems for people who are selling their houses if a solicitor completes a search and discovers there is a deficiency or something that is not quite as it should be.  That is the issue around management companies generally.<\/p>  <p>  The point I am making with this Bill is that some of these developments should not have management companies.  Some if not all the local authorities are interpreting this as a requirement under the Act to insist on a management company, which is at variance with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government circulars.  If that is insisted on, it gets included in the planning permission.  As we know, a planning application is a legal process.  Solicitors completing searches will go through it to ensure it is in compliance.  There could even be complaints to local authorities that they are not in compliance if the management is not included.<\/p>  <p>  In some cases management companies have operated in a manner that people would not have anticipated.  For example, some people have got into significant mortgage distress and cannot make their mortgage repayments.  The mortgage is often the first thing that is paid.  However, often a parking permit will not be provided if the management company is not paid.  At times it can create an unhealthy environment within a housing estate where neighbour is pitched against neighbour.<\/p><p>Formerly, in my experience, housing estates were generally managed by residents in an informal way, where they collected a residents' fee and collaborated in cutting grass and other maintenance.  That practice was a good initiative in terms of community building.  Management companies, particularly where there are issues of dispute, cause the opposite kind of community engagement and involvement.<\/p> <p> I have no difficulty with management companies being in place where they are required, and I believe some of the provisions of the Multi-Unit Developments Act have been helpful.  They have not always been followed to the letter of the law, but at least the law exists.  While I have no difficulty with companies required to be in place, I do have a difficulty where we oblige estates to have them or where some local authorities make the inclusion of a management company an obligation in situations in which that should not be the case.  This adds costs for people in situations in which it is unnecessary to do so and causes problems in getting those estates taken in charge.  I have checked the law and obtained legal advice on this issue, and despite what the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Development says, if a management company continues to exist, there is often resistance to taking an estate in charge. <\/p> <p> Deputy Michael McGrath tabled a Bill in the House some weeks ago seeking a reduction in property tax for specific groups of people living in housing where there is a management company.  I have some sympathy for that view because those people are paying a management fee for all of the management services within their estate and receive no services from the local authority, not even road sweeping.  Such people would surely feel aggrieved if they have to pay the same property tax as everybody else.  It is vital we do not put impediments in place to getting estates taken in charge so that a more normal arrangement can apply, similarly to neighbouring housing estates.<\/p> <p> The definition in the Act requires that all new residential developments, both apartments and conventional housing, will require a management company, as stated.  This is contrary to national, and often county, policy.  I am aware that in Kildare, the local authority was surprised the first time this happened and went out and got legal advice.  It then came back and agreed that the developer's interpretation of this was right.<\/p> <p> I do not care if the Minister accepts this proposed amendment and includes it a Government amendment in another Bill.  I do not care whose name goes on it.  What I care about is that people turn up at a solicitor's office, having struggled to get a large deposit together, and are then told they cannot have the keys of their house until they sign up to the management company.  This involves money that they probably would not have factored into their budgets in terms of household costs.  Then when the estate is completed and they try to get the estate taken in charge, they discover they have all sorts of issues in regard to winding down the management company.  Most people only want to view a showhouse and then buy their house.  If they can get the money together, they want to buy the house, move in and get on with their lives.  They do not want to get involved in this kind of complicated legal arrangement that is surplus to requirement, adds to their costs and should have been dealt with when the Minister's attention was drawn to it.<\/p> <p> It does not take a legal genius to read the definition in the Act and come to the view that some developers and solicitors have come to.  Increasingly, I find that people are precluded from selling their houses where, for example, an estate has not been taken in charge or the bond has lapsed.  This is an impediment to selling the house.  Why would we put people in harm's way when that is unnecessary?  I suggest it would only take 20 minutes to remedy this situation.  I do not care if the Minister does not accept my Bill, provided she commits to dealing with this issue before Christmas.  This situation should not be allowed to continue.  We are starting to see a situation in which developers are making applications to build and we do not want to have a condition like this tied into planning permissions.  This condition should not be there as it will cause problems for people in the future.<\/p> <p> Before the Multi-Unit Developments Act was enacted, the issue of management companies arose over and over again.  I remember debating the issue here in 2005 and 2006.  I remember the celebrated case relating to management companies in Tyrellstown, which forced hands a little on the issue.  This was probably the first piece of case law that showed some of the inadequacies regarding the issue.  If I remember correctly, this involved a mixed estate with significant numbers of houses and apartments and with some management companies set up directly by the local authority.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister to sort out this issue.  If my Bill is accepted, all it will require is five minutes on Committee Stage.  I do not care if the Department wants to repackage it as something else, provided something is done.  It makes me angry to see something like this continue when it is unnecessary, will cause problems, will cost people money, will cause significant administrative hassle for local authorities and will need solicitors to check back and forth on the issues.  The provision is at variance with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's circulars.  To be honest, I do not know why I have to raise the issue here and why it was not dealt with when it was drawn to the Minister's attention three or four years ago.  It should have been dealt with quickly and without fuss then.  I am surprised that did not happen, given that it is such a glaring difficulty.  I urge the Minister to accept the Bill and amend it in whatever way is required so that we can deal with this issue as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300003#A00200","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447409400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is unavailable today, I welcome the opportunity provided by Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill to address policy issues related to multi-unit developments.<\/p>  <p>  I want to state clearly that the Government opposes Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s Bill.  Before explaining the reasons for the Government&rsquo;s opposition, I want to recall for Deputies the reasons the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 was enacted.  The primary purpose of the 2011 Act was to reform the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of owners&rsquo; management companies, OMCs.  The Act gives residential unit owners, through their membership of the owners&rsquo; management company, a say in the management and operation of their development and a direct role in fixing the amount of annual service charge and sinking fund contribution that they are required to pay towards the upkeep and maintenance of the development.<\/p>  <p>  The Act establishes a new statutory framework for the management of multi-unit developments and the operation of owner management companies, and puts new accountability mechanisms in place.  A key element of the 2011 Act concerns the transfer of common areas of a multi-unit development from the developer to the owner management company.  Section 4 of the Act provides that in those cases in which some residential units have already been sold prior to the coming into operation of the legislation, the developer must transfer ownership of the relevant parts of the common areas to the owner management company within six months of the coming into operation of the Act.  In effect, such transfers were to be carried out by 1 October 2011.  In the case of completed developments, the developer must transfer ownership of the common areas to the relevant owner management company within six months of the coming into operation of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I should add that under section 3 of the Act, a residential unit in a new multi-unit development cannot be sold unless an owner management company has been established by the developer and ownership of relevant parts of the common areas have been transferred to that company.<\/p><p>The Act also contains provisions in relation to the operation of owners&rsquo; management companies.  Such companies are now required by law to hold an annual meeting and must in advance of that meeting provide unit owners with an annual report setting out details of income and expenditure, as well as assets and liabilities; the annual service charges and sinking fund accounts; planned expenditure on maintenance and repair; insurance cover; fire safety in the development; and contracts entered into by the company.  The Act also provides for a system of fair voting rights in owners&rsquo; management companies: under the Act, one vote attaches to each unit in a development, and each vote is of equal value.  The Act stipulates that an owners&rsquo; management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges to fund expenditure on the maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas within its control, and for the provision of common services such as security, legal and accounting services.  The annual charge must be calculated and apportioned on a transparent and fair basis and must be approved by a general meeting of the unit owners.  Each owners&rsquo; management company must also establish a sinking fund to cover outlays on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p> <p> Section 24 of the Act, which deals with the resolution of disputes, provides that a person, such as a unit owner, may apply to court for an order to enforce any right conferred or obligation imposed by the Act, including the obligation on a developer to transfer the common areas to the owners&rsquo; management company.  If satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, the court may make an appropriate order.  However, when applying to a court to commence proceedings, the applicant is required to state whether mediation or other similar dispute resolution process has been attempted.  If such a process has not been attempted, the court may, upon its own motion or at the request of a party to the proceedings, direct the parties to meet and attempt to settle the matter.  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, the court will proceed to deal with the matter.  The Minister&rsquo;s preference is that parties should try to resolve their differences by means of mediation and seek a remedy before the courts only when such efforts prove unsuccessful.<\/p> <p> The protective mechanisms set out in the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 apply to all developments that have an owners&rsquo; management company structure.  This includes not only apartment buildings containing residential units, but also the very many mixed developments and estates which contain apartment blocks as well as duplexes and more conventional housing units in terraces or other formats.  If there is an owners&rsquo; management company structure in place, the protections afforded by the 2011 Act for unit owners will apply to that development.  The need to extend the protections set out in the original Bill to these mixed and more traditional housing developments with an owners&rsquo; management company structure was raised by many Deputies and Senators in the course of consideration of the legislation by both Houses.  It was pointed out that a large number of these developments had been required to establish an owners&rsquo; management company as part of the planning conditions imposed by the relevant planning authority.  The extension of the scope of the legislation to these mixed developments has been given effect in Schedule 2 to the Act.<\/p> <p> Turning now to Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s Bill, the Government&rsquo;s opposition to it is based firstly on the fact that it seeks to remove mixed developments from the scope of the legislation and discard the protection that the Act affords to residential unit owners in such developments.  This would create a serious legal vacuum for such owners and could, at least in the short term, render their properties unsaleable.  I do not think that is what the Deputy intended and I accept that she said so.  It would be an unacceptably retrograde step to take, and is therefore unacceptable to the Minister and Government.<\/p> <p> The stated aim of the Bill is &ldquo;to amend the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 in order to better provide for the clear definition of multi-unit development thereby facilitating expedient application of the law in relation to the taking in charge of unfinished estates.&rdquo;  The position with regard to the taking in charge of estates is that the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the planning and development Acts.  Therefore, any changes to the taking in charge provisions must be considered in the context of that legislation rather than the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which does not deal with such matters.  In her speech, Deputy Murphy raised other issues she wants resolved.  While the taking in charge of multi-unit developments which comprise mixed and more traditional housing developments present specific challenges, the removal of such developments from the scope of the 2011 Act cannot be expected to overcome obstacles arising from the legal arrangements which separate the ownership of individual residential units from ownership of the common areas that are vested in an owners&rsquo; management company of which unit owners are members.<\/p> <p> Any changes to the statutory taking in charge arrangements would be a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister and Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Deputy asked whether this Bill could be dealt with elsewhere.  I will undertake to discuss this with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to see if they can accommodate what the Deputy wants to do, because it is probably more appropriate to that Department than to the Act that she is seeking to amend.<\/p> <p> In summary, the Minister and Government are opposed to Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s Bill because it would reduce the scope of the 2011 Act and thereby exclude the many mixed developments that benefit from the Act&rsquo;s protective provisions.  Moreover, any changes to the statutory provisions governing the taking in charge of unfinished developments should be progressed through appropriate amendments to planning and development legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300004#B00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447410000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Listening to the Minister of State reminded me a little of the experience, which Deputy Murphy referred to, of people in constituencies such as ours who were told when queueing to buy houses that if they did not sign then the price would go up by &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, and not to worry about the detail of the management company because they could later dissolve it.  The experience was of course radically different.  The Government's response to Deputy Murphy's Bill today is similar.  The fear is that if it agreed with Deputy Murphy this would remove the protection of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, when the point being made, in part, is that the Act has not provided the protection we thought it would and has not solved the problem created by the mushrooming of management companies in the early 2000s, which arose from a change in the nature of the buildings going up at that time and the move away from the traditional semi-detached type of development to more duplexes, which had probably never been heard of before then, combined with apartments, terraced houses and so on.  People found out, to their amazement, only a couple of years after moving into those houses that they were expected to pay an annual fee for services that would normally have been deemed public services, such as grass-cutting, the maintenance of lights and upkeep of the general area.  In many instances these people had bought modest dwellings at massively inflated prices and were paying this annual fee when those services were provided out of the public purse by the local authority to people in more settled and affluent dwellings down the road.  This situation has been aggravated by the introduction of the local property tax, because these people are now hit on the treble through general taxation, which should fund local authority services, local property tax, which should also cover that, and the management company fee.  In most of these instances, the hard-pressed families who are struggling to pay their mortgages and other bills are not getting any service for the money requested.<\/p>  <p>  The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 was designed to make it easier for owners to control the management companies and to exercise democratic control over the bills and how those companies would be structured.  In practice that has not worked, because many of these developments are too large.  In a development with 500 owners, made up of duplexes and apartments, there will never be wholehearted agreement.  That is impossible, particularly when there are different interests at play - for example, the apartment owners need a collective interest but the house owners less so.  It is understandable, however, that apartment owners would not want to lose the revenue from the house owners&rsquo; contribution.  Even where there is a clear division between services, many management companies exist for no reason.  People think that once the local authority takes in charge the roads, footpaths, lighting and large green areas, the management company will dissolve and go away, but they then discover that the management company has taken over the services the developer was responsible for prior to that.  They realise the management company existed in name only to provide public liability insurance and probably the maintenance of tiny incidental pieces of open space with a bit of shrubbery, which any able-bodied child could fix.<\/p><p>A management company is certainly not required in that regard.  The Multi-Unit Developments Act is not fit for purpose in that it does not allow people who do not get any service to dissolve a management company or to protect their own interests in that regard.  <\/p> <p> In my area, there is an estate comprising over 400 units, all of which are standard housing units of various types.  There are no apartments or duplexes in this estate.  Most of the services, including the roads, large green areas and so on, have been taken over by the local authority.  Outside of that there are a few incidental pieces of open space and a little on-street car parking, which is used to legitimise the existence of a management company.  Many of these open spaces and so on exist only to perpetuate and fund management companies.  People do not get any services, which is absolutely ludicrous.<\/p> <p> Deputy Murphy is trying by way of this legislation to correct an anomaly in the 2011 Act.  In my view, we need to review the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 in its entirety.  The deficiency identified by Deputy Murphy whereby, unwittingly, the 2011 Act, rather than protecting people by ensuring they do not enter into an arrangement whereby they could not dissolve a management company, might actually frogmarch them into such an arrangement.  That is ludicrous.  I do not see any sense in the Government refusing to accept this Bill.  As I said, we need to review the 2011 Act in its entirety.  <\/p> <p> There are a number of other estates in my area comprising 100 units or less, which are evenly made up of houses, apartments and duplexes, with an even division of services.  It is easy to delineate that the houses in these estates get no services and so they can be easily sliced off.  The idea that even in those types of areas which are more manageable residents have not been able to exercise the withdrawal of houses from management companies exposes the limitations of the 2011 Act, which is a body of work that we have to review.  For the moment, it is useful that Deputy Murphy has highlighted and flagged this issue.  The Government would be mad not to accept this legislation.  We should be trying to prevent what is happening in this area.  While the 2011 Act provides some protection for apartment owners. it does not protect the many other property owners in these multi-unit developments.  The purpose of that Act was to assist property owners in these developments in maintaining control over and making decisions in relation to management companies, including dissolution of same if they so wish, but it is not fit for purpose in this regard.  In that sense, Deputy Murphy's Bill is welcome and I support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300005#C00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447410600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il compliments Deputy Murphy on bringing forward this Bill.  She has been a longstanding campaigner on the issue of multi-unit developments and we believe her proposals should be considered by the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that people currently living in multi-unit developments pay management fees and are obliged to pay local property tax as well, such that they are paying on the double for services.  This is another anomaly that should be addressed by Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il has published a Bill on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the definition provisions are as simple as possible.  The Law Reform Commission has previously done much work in this area, in respect of which it has produced a report and recommendations for reform.  This Bill seeks to redefine the definition of a multi-unit development such that a structure requiring a management company would be a multi-unit development of not less than five units with one roof.  The Multi-Unit Developments Act was piloted through the Oireachtas by former Minister, Dermot Ahern, in 2009-10.  It introduced sweeping reforms for the owners of existing and new apartment and multi-unit residential complexes.  It updated legislation in apartment management and ownership and significantly refocused legal protections towards owners of apartments.  These comprehensive reforms were designed to improve the regulation of multi-unit developments and the governance of management companies in such developments in the context of the dramatic growth in apartment living in recent years.  Many people who have purchased apartments in multi-unit developments may not have fully realised the type of ownership arrangement into which they were entering and the responsibilities involved in membership of the property management company.  In some cases, developers were slow to transfer ownership of the common areas to the property management company and these delays have caused frustration for owners who want to become involved in managing and maintaining their developments.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Act complemented work in other areas.  In 2007, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government produced design standards for new apartments.  New guidelines on sustainable residential development in urban areas were produced in 2008.  In 2009, new regulations setting standards for rented accommodation were introduced.  The National Consumer Agency has also taken a keen interest in this issue and has engaged with many of the relevant bodies with a view to improving consumer protection in advance of this legislation.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement also produced an publication entitled, Company Law Handbook on Residential Property Owners' Management Companies.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Act amended the law relating to the ownership and management of the common areas of multi-unit developments.  It seeks to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of bodies responsible for the management of such common areas and to provide for related matters.  Former Minister, Dermot Ahern, also introduced new property<\/p>  <p>  In its report on multi-unit developments, the Law Reform Commission identified key issues to be addressed, including such matters as when a property management company is to be established and by whom; the timing of the transfer of ownership of common areas; the mechanics of taking control of the company by the apartment owners; and internal governance arrangements for owners' management companies.  The 2011 Act provides that a \"multi-unit development\" means a development being land on which there stands erected a building or buildings comprising a unit or units and that as respects such units it is intended that amenities, facilities and services are to be shared and subject to section 2(1) the development contains not less than five residential units.  The Act also makes provision for multi-unit developments with fewer than five units.<\/p>  <p>  When Deputy Murphy originally introduced her Bill she said that a flaw in the legislation means that any development of more than five houses is deemed to be a multi-unit development, which imposes on it a requirement to introduce a management company.  According to Deputy Murphy, that is how the local authorities are interpreting the legislation and that rather than resolving issues the legislation is posing new difficulties.  She also said the issue is a one of definition and has proposed a new definition.  It is highly unlikely that former Minister, Dermot Ahern, ever intended that the Bill should result in the circumstances identified by Deputy Murphy.  Accordingly Fianna F&aacute;il believes this Bill should be considered and supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300006#D00200","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1447410600,"counter":13,"content":"<p> I welcome this positive and constructive Bill and commend the work of Deputy Catherine Murphy in this regard.   I ask that the Government consider its focus.  It is disappointing that the Bill is being opposed by the Government.  Far too often the Government appears to view legislation from this side of the House as an excuse to practice its dissection skills.  It sets out to pull apart legislation rather than build on it.  On the few occasions I presented legislation before this Government, I received this treatment.  Instead of recognising the need for the legislation and allowing it to be built on at further Stages, the respective Ministers or Ministers of State sought to highlight minor flaws in it, as they found it, and took it upon themselves to engage in a lecturely critique of my legislative skills.  This is pointless engagement.  If an issue is important, it should be addressed.  If a Bill is constructive, it can be built on.  The Government should not oppose legislation for the sake of it, as the Government often feigns we on this side of the House do.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill recognises a flaw which went unnoticed in the 2011 Act, a flaw missed due to the incredibly protracted and stalled nature of its passage through the House.  The Act which this Bill seeks to amend was published in 2009.  It sets out the basis for how common areas should be managed in multi-unit developments.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the definition of this term was far too vague to fit the intention of the Government at the time.  While the Act made sense and was intended to deal with a real need, under scrutiny, it has been shown to fail to provide a sufficiently tight definition to achieve its objective properly.  Simply put, multi-unit developments are apartment complexes, commercial developments or a combination of both, with retail units on the ground floor and residences on the upper floors.  They have become common across the urban landscape, from small towns to cities.<\/p> <p> A multi-development unit is defined in the Act as a development on which stands a building or buildings comprising a unit or units, which has amenities, facilities or services for sharing the development and contains no fewer than five residential units.  While this definition appears to be sufficient, it has since been deemed to have been too broad and vague and has been applied to conventional housing, including semi-detached and terraced homes and duplex complexes, on the same site.  The outworking of this is that there is a legal requirement for a management company to be established in a large number of cases where this is not necessary or practical and has been unworkable.<\/p> <p> On first reading, I did not identify this problem in the original Act.  It is for this reason that legal experts are required to oversee legislation at all stages to consider unintended consequences.  While I cannot be certain that the Bill before us would not also have unintended consequences, I am certain that an amendment to the Act is needed.  The Government should take the opportunity to allow the Bill to advance, before subjecting it to expert scrutiny.  It should use it as a starting point for a new Act that will deal with a problem the Government has not yet addressed.<\/p> <p> We could also take this opportunity to examine other issues that arise from the Act and its failings.  Under the 2011 Act, tenants have no right to representation on the boards of their management companies, despite the important responsibilities and powers these companies have in respect of developments.  This failing must be addressed by empowering tenants and providing them with a voice on management companies and elsewhere in the housing market.  As a group, tenants are voiceless and, unlike landlords and developers, they do not have a lobby group to represent them.  While charities and community bodies play a role in this area, tenants do not have a group that works exclusively to protect their rights.  The Government includes 24 Fine Gael Party Deputies who are landlords, although the number may fall to 23 as Deputy Barry has decided he cannot hack being unable to raise the rent on his properties for two years.  The Cabinet and Government benches include few, if any, tenants and while there are a small number of tenants in the House, they are outnumbered by home owners, landlords and developers.<\/p> <p> The State must support the establishment of a tenants union to which tenants would have a right to affiliate and from which they could seek help.  Given the new measures announced by the Government this week, the supports available to the Private Residential Tenancies Board must be enhanced to enable it to do its job properly.<\/p> <p> I have personal experience of problems with management companies, including issues with common areas, buildings insurance, health and safety and parking.  Their powers to clamp vehicles in parking spaces on developments is particularly contentious.

This debate focuses on one of the legacy issues of the building boom during the Celtic tiger.  Deputy Catherine Murphy very ably argued that the Bill addresses one of many flaws in the legislation on multi-unit developments.  This problem requires to be rectified.  Terminology such as \"taking in charge\", \"management companies\", etc., are part of a new language that developed as a result of the boom in the Celtic tiger years.  Many shortcomings arose during that period because new and different types of buildings and accommodation developed for individuals and families.  Many mistakes were made, not only in terms of building design but also in respect of legal issues pertaining to how buildings would be managed.  This resulted in the coming into existence of management companies.  I am sure this will not be the last debate the House will have on problems with planning and buildings that were part of the fall-out from the building boom.<\/p>  <p>  It is the prerogative of the Government to oppose the Bill and I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy English, for the Government's approach to the legislation.  He acknowledged the arguments Deputy Catherine Murphy made and the facts relating to multi-unit developments that she presented.  No one would argue that the 2011 Act is perfect and none of the previous speakers argued in favour of diluting it in any way.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and others seek to strengthen the legislation and rectify a flaw in its provisions.  It is regrettable, therefore, that, on the one hand, the Government parties acknowledge the shortcomings in the existing law while, on the other hand, opposing the Bill without providing a solution or resolution that would address the important point Deputy Catherine Murphy made.  Incidentally, the problem the Deputy raised in her example may not be identical to the problems other Deputies will have encountered as members of a local authority.  Nevertheless, it is not a million miles away from some of the complications some Deputies will have dealt with, especially those among us who represent constituencies in which large-scale developments were built.  The legacy of these developments has been a series of problems that have caused great distress for families and individuals who bought properties in them.<\/p>  <p>  I take in good faith the Minister of State's undertaking to raise the issue with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey.  Surely the Department has a sufficient number of people with the ability to analyse the case presented by Deputy Catherine Murphy and supported by other speakers and produce some resolution to the issues raised.  In fairness to Deputy Murphy, she argued that it is up to the Government to address any flaws in the Bill.  Some of us may not be as reasonable as she is on this matter.  Surely it is possible to draft a provision that would rectify what is a real problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300007#E00200","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1447411200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>With respect to Government Deputies, it disturbs and upsets me in debates in this Chamber when the Government refuses to accept legislation proposed by Opposition Deputies who have invested a great deal of effort and thought in producing their Bills.

I can only emphasise that at times some of us here do what we think is right not for ourselves or the Opposition but for the country.  If one looks at what Deputy Catherine Murphy has done and the intricate detail she has gone into, there are areas that are faulty.  It is obvious and legal views support that.  I appeal to the Minister of State to allow this to be debated further as he has said he will.  Let us put table some amendments and listen to what has to be said.  This is not a question of the Government accepting amendments from us and that being one up for the Opposition.  That is not what we are about here.  Some of us are here to do what we think is right and good.  At times, if we think the Government is right, we will support it.  We must look at that.<\/p>  <p>  We must look at management companies.  There are grave difficulties with management companies and how they are structured and organised and continue to operate.  I gave examples.  I was looking at something on the Internet before I came to the Chamber.  I searched for \"problems with management companies\" and found that thousands of people are saying they have them.  There are problems of poor communications and bad screening of tenants.  The worry is that so much power will be taken away from the individual living in some of these areas.  They are not sure any more based on the history of management companies how it will affect their lives.<\/p>  <p>  I take on board what the Minister of State says.  Deputy Murphy's Bill is brilliant.  She has put a lot of effort, thought and cost into it and further debate would be worthwhile.  I trust the Minister of State will do what he says.

In relation to the Bill, there is the anomaly Deputy Catherine Murphy has pointed out.  The idea that a group of five houses could be considered a multi-unit development and then have a management company applied is ludicrous.  The idea that the Minister of State is not accepting the Bill but will look into it has raised scepticism because the issue has been going on for ten years.  I have had a management company inflicted on my house since 2003.  For ten to 12 years, the ridiculous carry on of these management companies has been known about.  Not only do we need to accept the Bill, we need even more reform.<\/p>  <p>  Private management companies have been a scourge in Dublin West and many newly developed areas of the country for quite some time.  Next to nothing has been done by the political parties who oversaw the establishment of these companies in the first place to correct the grave errors that have been visited on residents by them.  Ordinary houses with front and back doors are being charged extortionate fees by private management companies.  Management companies were never intended for houses.  They were always designed for collective structures of apartment blocks, usually with internal corridors, lifts and common areas.  They were imposed on houses during the Celtic tiger when multi-unit developments were being established and they have never been lifted off them since.  We also have issues with management companies in apartments.  While apartments may need management companies or collective structures for insurance, there is no accountability or democracy in many cases while the fees rise to massive levels.<\/p>  <p>  I want to show the Minister of State the bill from my management company.  It is a management company I do not need.  I have front and back gardens which I mow myself.  I pay my own insurance but this is what I will be faced with at a meeting on Monday, 23 November.  On this occasion it is Fine Gael and the Labour Party, but Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party had a chance to deal with this issue and did not.  The common expenses I face include the directors' and officers' indemnity insurance.  The Minister of State does not have to pay that.  I assume he lives in a house.  I have to pay for graffiti removal.  The Minister of State does not have to pay for that either.  Also included is non-domestic waste management.  Obviously, we have had the bin charges enforced and this is an extra waste management expense which has nothing to do with me.  The sundry expenses are listed as &euro;6,650 and I will be interested to find out what that is about.  There are bank charges.  I have my own bank accounts and pay charges on them but now I have to pay extra ones.  I have to pay audit fees for a company I do not want as well as secretarial, legal and agent's fees.  How long is this going to go on?  Not only has the Minister of State not accepted a very minor anomaly that Deputy Catherine Murphy has pointed out, but also there have been public meetings throughout the country that Fine Gael members have attended.<\/p>  <p>  This is a live issue.  Residents are being summonsed to court for refusing to pay for something for which they should not have to pay.  The reason is that the Government has failed to deal with this in the four and a half years it has been in office.  Deputies Joan Burton and Leo Varadkar and the other Ministers who live in constituencies where this is a major problem have done nothing to correct it.  This all started because during the Celtic tiger when developers ruled the land, they decided it would be a great idea while waiting for local authorities to take estates in charge to impose fees on the residents for providing all the services the developers should have been providing in the interim.  They put houses into these management companies for that reason as well.  We have a situation in Tyrrelstown, an area bereft of facilities, a matter which I will not go into, where there are eight management companies on an estate.  In respect of seven of them, the developer was the director as were his sons and other family members.  They were divided up like Africa after the colonial wars by way of straight lines.  Some people are in different management companies from their next door neighbours or the people across the road.  This lunacy has been well flagged.  We have had public meetings attended by 100 and 200 people but nothing has been done.  The main gainers out of this were the property management companies set up and related to the developers in most cases.<\/p>  <p>  Something happened in 2008.  There was a recession and people lost their jobs.  They cannot afford these Celtic tiger follies any longer.  Residents are finding that they cannot afford to pay and are now refusing to pay.  They are right to refuse.  Why should they pay for something from which they get no benefit?  Residents are suffering because they are being summonsed to court.  Residents from Tyrrelstown and other areas will be up in court shortly.  While no bankers or developers have been brought to court, the residents who had management companies inflicted on their houses are.  It has been pointed out in the context of many other Bills that these residents are also being clamped.  Management companies decide they run the whole area and can create their own laws.  They can decide that a resident in arrears may not get a parking tag and will have his or her car clamped outside his or her own house, as will any relatives when they call.  This was pointed out to the Government in the context of the clamping Bill brought forward a number of months ago but nothing was done.  The Government would not even exclude management companies from being empowered to clamp people.  As such, I am sorry but I do not take at face value the Minister of State's promise to deal with this and neither do the people of Tyrrelstown, Ongar, Castlecurragh or my own estate.<\/p><p> Deputy Higgins first raised this issue in the Chamber ten years ago when Bertie Ahern sat where the Minister of State is sitting.  In 2006, recognising that it was a major issue, Bertie Ahern sent a circular to the environment Department to the effect that houses should not be subject to management companies, and he defined a house as something that had a front entrance and a back entrance.  The problem is that those of us who bought houses between 2002 and 2006 are still stuck with management companies.<\/p> <p> I have been proactive in trying to assist residents with resolving this issue.  We have held many public meetings, meetings with the council, etc.  The late Brian Lenihan told residents that they could not dissolve a management company contract.  It was as if a contract was set in stone.  Of course, he was wrong.  We have found and moved on a legal mechanism for releasing our houses from the management company.  Unfortunately, and despite a resounding vote of apartment and house owners, we cannot get them released because only 55% of residents have returned the form given that absentee landlords do not care.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to introduce legislation to allow houses to be released.  People who were pressured into signing contracts to get houses were led to believe they would have the right to dissolve management companies as soon as their developments were taken in charge by a council.  The council has taken over all of the services of the estates in question.  It is erroneous of Fianna F&aacute;il to mention the property tax because that has nothing to do with management companies.  Councils do not get the benefit of management company fees.  That erroneous argument only complicates matters.<\/p> <p> Householders must be able to be released from the contracts they signed and management companies must be accountable and democratic.  Residents snared in these contracts should form action groups and hold meetings to discuss what they would like to do.  What is important is that there should be no division between apartment owners and house owners because we are all victims.  People should lobby their local Deputies to press for legislation that should have been introduced at the start of this Government.  They should make this an election issue and punish parties that have had 12 years to do something about it but have left people with unaffordable bills of hundreds of euro per year.  I am referring to Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  They had ten years in government to change the situation.  Now, close to an election, they tell Deputy Catherine Murphy on a Friday that they will not address something that could ensnare houses.  That is not good enough and we need action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300008#F00600","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447412400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I appreciate that not all of the Deputies opposite were present when I spoke, but I will add to what I said.

I agree with much of what has been stated about the residual issues in the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  I deal with them routinely.  I know of examples in various estates.  Every management company is set up differently.  A part of the problem is that there is no universal response, but that is also a reason not to make the situation worse, which is what I was trying to address in this Bill.  The solution should not just be for people in the future but for what has already happened, nor should it compound the problem further.<\/p><p>People are having difficulties trying to get their estates taken in charge, to sell their homes and so on because management companies are impediments.  When considering this matter, I gathered information and met a solicitor for a legal opinion.  He stated that the definition was vague and conceivably included every housing estate and residential street in the country.  However, he presumed that it meant that amenities, facilities and services were to be shared only between the residential units and not the wider public.  In this sense, he stated that it was arguable that where the roads and services in an estate had been taken in charge, the estate was not a multi-unit development and where roads and services or any part thereof had not been taken in charge, it was such a development.  I am not making this up.  The solicitor in question is good on property law.<\/p><p>I also asked him to give me an opinion on another matter that had been cropping up and for which I wanted a solution.  Winding down management companies is complex because they are not all the same.  Getting every owner to sign a deed is difficult, as Deputy Coppinger mentioned, when there is a mixture of people in an estate.  Some renters cannot get in contact with their landlords and some owners do not want to sign the deed and apply to a Circuit Court pursuant to section 24(5)(<i>g<\/i>) of the 2011 Act.  These are not the kinds of actions people expect when winding up companies either voluntarily or by way of an order.  A voluntary liquidation is expensive and a court-ordered liquidation is also to be avoided, given the expense of court applications and liquidators' fees.  Striking a company off the register of companies would also be expensive.  None of the solutions I considered was clear cut and residual problems had to be considered.  This one small issue is about people not being snared by bills like those to which Deputy Coppinger referred.  I know of people who are charged for lifts in buildings where there are no lifts.<\/p><p>Developers were delighted with the management company arrangement in the early part of the previous decade and took full advantage of it during the crash.  Often, people in housing estates were paying for the maintenance of areas that used to be the responsibility of developers until those estates were taken in charge.  Where we have managed to get a council to take an estate in charge, the management company is normally shrunk down to just the area around the apartment block while the rest of the estate - roads, water, etc. - is taken in charge.  That one must even do this proves my point.  By ignoring this problem, the Government is creating a legacy in the same way that people were ensnared.<\/p><p>I am shocked by the response of the Department and the Minister of State.  I take his commitment to speak to the Minister at face value, but this is my fourth Bill.  Only one, a planning Bill, has not been opposed so far.  It was sent to the committee on which I sit.  I met departmental officials who stated that they would include many of its measures in planning legislation which was forthcoming at the time, but nothing was included.<\/p><p>If that effort was made for something that was not opposed and where it was seen to have merit, what chance have I got in arguing here for something the Government totally opposes, despite seeing merits in it?  That is the absolutely outrageous aspect of the response.  I am inferring that this is intended but it should not and cannot be intended.  People will arrive to a solicitor's office and do exactly the same thing as happened ten and 12 years ago.  They will be told that unless they sign the document, they will not get the keys to the house.  They will discover that there is a residual charge every year and it will be so legally complicated, it will be difficult to get out of it.  This could cause problems when they seek to sell the property as even if the estate is taken in charge and the management company exists but is not functioning, there may be problems with title.<\/p> <p> The Department does not get this but I hope the Minister of State does.  I do not want to see people put to the pin of their collars trying to pay their mortgages and live their lives being asked to pay a bill that is unnecessary and with a legal arrangement that will cause all sorts of problems.  It creates work for the legal sector in trying to unpick the issue.  The Department does not seem really to understand what I was trying to say in putting forward this Bill, although I outlined when I introduced it on First Stage what it intended to do.  To a great degree, this Friday session is just about fobbing us off.  That is my experience, having put forward and debated four different Bills since the initiative's introduction.  Nothing from those sessions has made it to the point of being enacted into law.  It is all very well that this is outlined as an initiative in D&aacute;il reform but it is not reform if there is no meaningful outcome.<\/p> <p> I will take the Minister of State at face value and I hope he will revert with a proposed solution.  This is a very real problem and it will affect people who do not even know it is a problem.  This Bill cannot be allowed to gather dust and the issue should be dealt with in a timely way.  I am not precious about my name being on anything, as long as the issue is resolved.  It would not take much to do that if there is an acceptance that this matter needs resolution.  Does the Department believe the matter needs such resolution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300009#G00400","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447413000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447413000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 117(1A), the division is postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 17 November 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300010#H00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Freedom of Movement (Common Travel Area) (Travel Documentation) Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1447413000,"counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300010#H00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1447413000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I note it is Friday the 13th but I hope that will not go against me and the Minister of State might accept this Bill.  The issue of a potential \"Brexit\" is on the mind of nearly every Member of the House.  Earlier this week, the Taoiseach was in London and met British Prime Minister David Cameron, discussing the potential for a Brexit.  The Bill before the House is timely, regardless of what will happen in that referendum in the United Kingdom, as it will enhance and secure our relationship with our closest neighbours with respect to open travel.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated in the House when I introduced the Bill last year, it provides for passport-free travel for qualifying persons travelling within the common travel area.  The common travel area can be a grey area in law and causes confusion for people travelling within it as to what types of identification are required.  As we know, the common travel area is supposed to be a border-free zone - in theory at least - between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.  It is an abnormal area of the law with practical implications and associated political sensitivity.<\/p>  <p>  Before I delve into the Bill and what it proposes, I will comment on the land border that Ireland shares with the United Kingdom in light of a potential Brexit.  Many people have spoken about the implications of this land border, which cuts through many farmyards in Border counties.  Some have said that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, passport controls will be reinstated.  I do not believe that will be the case if the United Kingdom decides, unfortunately, to leave the European Union.  Passport and border controls along the Northern Irish Border are not inevitable in the case of a Brexit.  We know protocol 20, which deals with the application of certain aspects of Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to the United Kingdom and Ireland, which is annexed to the European Union treaties, means that EU law recognises the common travel area.  It acknowledges the special travel arrangements between the countries in that borders in the traditional sense have never existed.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of a Brexit, the Northern Irish Border would become an external EU border but this is irrelevant for passport and border control because neither the United Kingdom nor Ireland is party to the Schengen area.  Instead, they operate the common travel area between them.  If anything, the recent introduction of reciprocal visa arrangements for third state nationals through the British-Irish visa scheme has strengthened the ties that the two states have on their own border policies.  British and Irish border policies between the two states as part of the common travel area will continue to be separate from either state's membership of the European Union.  Customs matters, on the other hand, are relevant, but that is beyond the scope of the common travel area that we deal with today.<\/p>  <p>  Although there is no absolute requirement to present a passport for travel within the common travel area for Irish or British citizens, the reality is very different.<\/p><p>The legislation I am proposing is to ensure that a transport operator, such as an airline, leaving from an Irish point of departure cannot demand the carrying of a passport from an Irish citizen travelling within the common travel area.  I am going to outline two established practices that prove the common travel area has, over time, been weakened instead of strengthened.<br\/><br\/>The first is one of which all Deputies will be aware.  On arrival in Dublin Airport, all persons, regardless of where they are flying from, must produce identification to enter the State.  By not having a different stream in Dublin Airport for arrivals from other airports in Ireland and the United Kingdom, Irish airports are out of kilter with UK practice.  When one arrives at any of the London airports from Dublin, for example, one does not enter through immigration managed by the UK Border Agency.  Instead, one enters via a separate channel marked &quot;Domestic UK flights and from Ireland.&quot;  Dublin Airport provides no equivalent arrangements for &quot;Domestic Irish flights and [those] from the United Kingdom.&quot;  This clearly demonstrates that the practice adopted by the Irish National Immigration Service is not in the spirit of the common travel area.<br\/><br\/>The second practice is carried out by one prominent airline in particular, which does not let Irish citizens board its aircraft in Ireland without producing a valid passport.  This applies to its flights to mainland Europe, entering the Schengen area, and this is fine; however, it even requires passengers to produce a passport on flights to the United Kingdom from Ireland, and, in the past when the airline operated flights within Ireland, on such flights, which is very wrong.<br\/><br\/>Current legislation does not prohibit any carrier involved in transporting people within the common travel area from seeking appropriate confirmation of their identity.  I appreciate that these are the terms and conditions that travellers sign up to when they purchase tickets.  However, the requirement for Irish citizens to produce a passport is an unnecessary hindrance to what the common travel area is supposed to be about.  Other airlines flying between Ireland and the United Kingdom do not mandate all passengers to carry passports and they accept any other relevant identification matching the name on the passenger's ticket.  These airlines operate in the spirit of the common travel area.  If some airlines can do this, why is it not possible for all airlines to be mandated to do so for a better, more streamlined common travel area?<br\/><br\/>The immigration practice at Irish airports, and the operational methods used by a particular airline flying within Ireland and the United Kingdom, collectively undermine the common travel area.  The crux of the matter here is that currently no real common travel area exists.  My Bill aims to bring about a more inclusive, coherent and sensible common travel area.  This would make travel between Ireland and the United Kingdom, within the common travel area, much easier for everyone.  It would also prohibit a travel carrier from obliging persons entitled to avail of the common travel area to use passports.  This would bring all airlines into line with established practices among the vast majority of airlines operating within the common travel area.  It would allow means of identification other than a passport to be produced, such as a valid driver's licence, a student card, a Garda age card or a work identification card including a photograph.  It would put an end to the current prohibitive and confusing practices.<br\/><br\/>There is currently no legislation specifically aimed at governing the travel documents required for travel within the common travel area.  The common travel area operated for a long time under administrative arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It was the judiciary that legitimised it as a point of public policy in Kweder <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Justice in 1996.  A significant judgment for the common travel area came from the High Court in 2011 in Pachero <i>v<\/i>. Minister for Justice and Equality.  The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan, called the common travel area &quot;a misnomer,&quot; stating that &quot;the common travel area has long ceased to be a genuine passport free travel area,&quot; and that ''[c]onfusion abounds regarding the limits of the common travel area.&quot;  The court went as far as to say that further legal aspects of the common travel area will arise again beyond the immediate set of individual circumstances in that case.<br\/><br\/>While substantial legal overhaul of the common travel area may be needed, this Bill attempts to address some aspects of it.  With the introduction of the new passport cards this year, travel between Ireland and the United Kingdom will theoretically be easier for those who possess the card.  The introduction of this card had not been announced publicly when I introduced this Bill last year.  However, it does not take away from the fact that problems still exist for real passport-free travel within the common travel area.  Passports have a significant cost for the individual.  They cost &euro;95 over the counter, and a further &euro;35 for a passport card, giving a minimum total of &euro;130.  That is a significant amount of money, especially for pensioners.  It is becoming prohibitive.  Previously, it was free for pensioners to get passports, but that was taken away a number of years ago as part of other cutbacks.  Perhaps that is something that could be reconsidered in the future.  For British citizens, no such passport card exists, and they do not have national ID cards, like other EU member states.  Therefore, British citizens could be still mandated to carry their passports when visiting Ireland, within the common travel area, on certain airlines.  Instead, we should be allowing passengers travelling within the common travel area to use the recommended acceptable forms of photo identification, instead of encouraging people to carry a passport.<br\/><br\/>This Bill would allow carriers to continue to operate identification checks for passengers for travel in the common travel area.  However, they would no longer be allowed to compel qualifying persons transiting within the common travel area to present or carry a passport.  I trust the Minister of State, Deputy English, along with his officials, will take what I have proposed into consideration.  Perhaps we can look at other ways of ensuring the integrity of the common travel area by incorporating some of the ideas I and other speakers mention today into amendments in proposed future legislation.  We must do all we can to preserve, protect, and enhance the common travel area.  The common travel area is supposed to be passportless and we should do everything to make it this way.  It is in Ireland's, and the United Kingdom's, interest that the common travel area be as meaningful and as bureaucracy-free as it can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300010#H00500","speaker":"1206","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447413600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here on a Friday and am pleased to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to address the House and to respond on behalf of the Government to the Freedom of Movement (Common Travel Area) (Travel Documentation) Bill 2014, which has been introduced by Deputy Terence Flanagan.  I thank the Deputy for outlining the objectives of his short Bill and apologise that the Minister herself could not be here to take it, as she would have preferred.  In a nutshell, the Deputy is seeking to provide for a situation in which carriers will not be allowed to request the passport of a passenger for identity purposes where the passenger is permitted to travel within the common travel area.<\/p><p>There is no statutory requirement on a person who is from Ireland or the UK, or who is subject to EU freedom of movement regulations, availing of the common travel area, CTA, to be in possession of a passport when entering the State.  However, for a variety of practical reasons, most such nationals travelling by air or sea will have in their possession a passport, travel document or other form of identity that establishes their nationality.<br\/><br\/>In view of the changed nature of travel security, especially the heightened awareness of the security risks associated with airline travel since 9-11, air carriers require travellers on all routes, including within the CTA, to produce a satisfactory identification document for travel, usually a driving licence or passport, and a particular carrier will permit travel only on presentation of a passport or national identification card.  The relevant provisions in this regard are set out in section 11 of the Immigration Act 2004 as amended by section 34(a) of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>The CTA has existed since 1922, except for a brief period during the Second World War years, reflecting the ties of history and kinship between our two countries, and also labour market and business needs.  The protection of the CTA arrangement has long been regarded as a legitimate and fundamental public policy priority for both the Irish and UK Governments.  Co-operation on CTA matters between the two jurisdictions is excellent and very strong.<br\/><br\/>Under this Government, this co-operation was given added impetus with the signing in 2011 between the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the then UK Minister for Immigration of a joint statement on common travel area co-operation, which included a joint work programme in the area of data sharing, visas and electronic borders management systems.  The joint statement identified the following aims for CTA co-operation: to facilitate the movement of legitimate travellers within the CTA; to identify and develop further measures to enhance economic development between the two jurisdictions; to prevent individuals intent on abusing the arrangement from travelling to the CTA; to support and facilitate the return of individuals to their country of origin where they do reach or enter the CTA unlawfully; and to develop ways of challenging the credibility of visa and asylum applications where appropriate and develop mechanisms of re-documentation.<br\/><br\/>A fundamental feature of the CTA arrangement is the freedom of movement for persons travelling between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which continues to be of immense importance to the economic, social and cultural well-being of both jurisdictions.  It is essential that the benefits derived from this arrangement are not undermined by illegal movement, criminal activity or threats to security in either jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>A central feature of the operation of the CTA has been that each state enforces the others conditions of landing for non-nationals.  The current manifestation of this requirement can be found in section 4(3)(<i>h<\/i>) of the Immigration Act 2004, which empowers an Irish immigration office to refuse entry to the State to a non-national where the officer is satisfied that the non-national intends to travel, whether immediately or not, to Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and would not qualify for admission to Great Britain or Northern Ireland if he or she arrived there from a place other than the State.  To that end it is, and has always been, the case that there is close co-operation between the Irish and British immigration authorities on a strategic and operational basis.<br\/><br\/>The programme of work under the joint statement has given rise to the highly successful Irish short stay visa waiver programme, which was announced by the Government as part of its jobs initiative with a view to promoting tourism from emerging markets.  It commenced on 1 July 2011.  Under the programme, certain visas issued by the authorities of the United Kingdom are recognised for the purposes of travel to Ireland.  However, it has some limitations, such as the fact that it allows for travel only in one direction.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly, in June 2014, the Minister formally announced the introduction of the British-Irish visa scheme, BIVS, between Ireland and the United Kingdom, which commenced in the autumn of that year.  This was a landmark development in CTA co-operation.  At the time, she stated that it marked an historic development in the relationship between Ireland and the UK and in the operation of the CTA.  The BIVS allows for travel to and around the CTA on a single visa.  The scheme applies to visitors from China and India, and the plan is to roll it out to other visa nationals in due course.<br\/><br\/>Under the scheme, visitors are able to travel freely within the CTA using either an Irish or UK visa.  This means tourists, business visitors, etc., are able, for the first time, to visit both Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a single visa.  This co-operation not only results in greater facilitation of legitimate travellers than heretofore, but it has made a positive contribution to tourism and jobs, as the tourism industry has acknowledged.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the Bill before us, any proposal which has implications for the CTA requires close and careful scrutiny.  While I understand the intention and motivation behind the Bill, it could have potentially serious consequences not intended by the Deputy which, in certain instances, could undermine the effectiveness of immigration control and put at risk the protection of the CTA.  Section 1 provides for an amendment to section 11 of the Immigration Act 2004 by the insertion of a new provision for the current subsection (4).  This new provision repeals the current subsection (4) and provides for the insertion of a new subsection (4A) which is the substantial provision of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 11(1) of the 2004 Act, as amended, provides that every person, other than minors, landing in the State is required to have a valid passport.  Section 11(2) requires every person landing or embarking from the State to furnish, <i>inter alia<\/i>, their passport.  Section 11(3) makes it an offence to breach section 11.  Section 11(4) provides that section 11 does not apply to persons, other than non-nationals, coming from, or embarking for, a place in the State, Great Britain or Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Justice and Equality has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General on the Bill and a number of legal difficulties have been identified with the new section 4A which give cause for concern.  Section 11(4) of the Immigration Act 2004 exempts persons, other than non-nationals, who are travelling within the CTA from the passport control measures provided for under section 11 of the 2004 Act.  The provision in the new section 11(4A) purports to provide a general exemption from passport control cutting across all legislation, and not just section 4 of the 2004 Act.<br\/><br\/>In fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and INIS immigration officers utilise a range of legislative provisions under the Immigration Acts and, in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other legislative powers such as the Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  For example, under section 33 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an authorised officer for the purposes of the Act, may, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, require any person on an aerodrome to give his or her name and address and to produce other evidence of his or her identity; state the purpose of his or her being on the aerodrome; and account for any baggage or other property which may be in his or her possession.  In circumstances where a garda has reason to believe that the person has a passport which would satisfy the requirements, it would be unreasonably restrictive that he or she cannot demand that it be produced in such circumstances.  The situation becomes more invidious in cases involving criminality, including child abduction and human trafficking.<br\/><br\/>Whereas section 11(4) exempts persons, other than non-nationals, who are travelling within the CTA from passport control under section 11 of the 2004 Act, the new section 11(4A) would purport to provide a general exemption from passport control in respect of any &quot;person who is entitled to avail of transit within the CTA without the requirement to carry a passport&quot; which category is not restricted to persons excluding non-nationals and regardless of whether the person so entitled is travelling within the CTA.  At the very least, the provision is ambiguous, and, conceivably, its implementation could cause chaos at our borders with passengers claiming a general exemption from passport controls.  This scenario could have the further, albeit unintended, outcomes regarding the matter I mentioned earlier, namely, that a key feature of CTA co-operation is that each State enforces the others conditions of landing for non-nationals.  The relevant legislative provision is section 4(3)(<i>h<\/i>) of the 2004 Act.  The concern is that new section 11 (4A) could compromise the effect of section 4(3)(<i>h<\/i>) of the 2004 Act in that the latter provision operates on the basis that immigration officers have the power, <i>inter alia<\/i>, to confirm that a non-national has a valid passport.<br\/><br\/>Incongruously, the amendment could result in immigration officers being faced with non-nationals who might assert an entitlement to travel without a passport yet in respect of whom the immigration officer may have a concern that section 4(3)(<i>h<\/i>) applies.  It is a key power in the protection of the CTA external border, and, were it to be compromised in any way, it would have serious consequences for the operation of the CTA.<br\/><br\/>The proposed section 11(4A) is predicated on the assumption that the &quot;Common Travel Area&quot; is a legislative term of art.  It is not.  Notwithstanding that it is referenced in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the CTA is an agreement between Ireland and the UK that has manifested in law, rather than itself being a matter of any legal treaty between the two states.<\/p><p>Accordingly, if the proposed provision is to be effective, the CTA will have to be defined in national law.  Ultimately, and this applies to my earlier comments on the proposed section 11(4A) of the 2004 Act, it is not clear who would be \"entitled to avail of transit within the Common Travel Area without the requirement to carry a passport\" under the proposed section 11(4A).  Such uncertainty would make it all but impossible to implement this provision.  The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that this Bill is seeking to address conditions in respect of identity documents imposed by carriers which the Deputy considers should not be imposed by carriers.  It is the view of the Office of the Attorney General that the proposed section 11(4A) would have no effect on carriers but would prohibit the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies from exercising certain powers.  Therefore, there is dissonance between the intent of the Bill and its effect, with its effect being potentially to undermine the capacity of immigration officers to protect the integrity of the CTA.<\/p> <p> The Minister accepts that the matters I have set out with regard to the Bill were not the Deputy's intended outcome when he introduced this legislation.  However, she hopes he will accept that the proposal is seriously flawed and is not something she or the Government could support.  The Minister would reiterate the point that any legislation that has an impact on the CTA arrangement requires close and careful consideration.  Her current legislative priority in the asylum and immigration area is the enactment of the international protection Bill.  She hopes that Deputies will co-operate in the early passage of that Bill through the D&aacute;il.  The Minister for Justice and Equality proposes to introduce further legislation in the immigration area subsequent to the international protection Bill.  Any issues concerning the CTA could be examined in that context at that stage.  Perhaps the Deputy will be able to contribute to the debate on that legislation when it takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300011#J00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447414800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill proposed by Deputy Terence Flanagan, which would offer passport-free travel to qualifying people who are travelling within the common travel area, which comprises the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  The Bill proposes that no transport operator can demand that a qualifying person, such as a citizen of Ireland, the UK or elsewhere within the European economic area, who travels within the common travel area should require a passport to do so.  Although the common travel area between Ireland and the UK has been in operation since the 1920s, it is not specifically provided for in legislation.  The first legal recognition of this common travel area was contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  As a result of the existence of the common travel area, no passport controls are in operation for Irish and UK citizens travelling between the two countries.  One does not need to have a passport to enter the other country.  All air and sea carriers require some form of identification and some regard a passport as the only valid form of identification.  That is where these problems arise.<\/p><p>Immigration authorities may require a traveller to have valid official photo identification which shows his or her nationality.  When he introduced this Bill, Deputy Flanagan referred to this as &quot;a grey area [that] can cause confusion to people travelling within the common travel area as to what forms of identification are required.&quot;  He also referred to the case of a businessman who was not allowed by an unnamed airline to board a flight to the UK, where he was due to do business, on the basis that he was not carrying a passport.  I am reminded of an incident earlier this year when a rugby referee from Wales who was flying to this country from Bristol to officiate at a Leinster game was prevented from travelling by Ryanair because of the absence of a passport.  Aer Lingus stepped in to facilitate the referee in that case.  Deputy Flanagan rightly referred to the case of the businessman he raised as an example of red tape.  When businesses complain about the burden of regulation, they are usually referring to red tape imposed by the State.  In this case, one business was imposing a regulation on another.  It is interesting to note that Ryanair previously called on the European Commission to reduce the regulatory burden costs on all airlines.  Similarly, Ryanair once challenged the insistence by Hungarian border police that flight crews landing briefly in Budapest should disembark and undergo security checks before flying out again.<\/p><p>On First Stage, Deputy Flanagan stated:<\/p><blockquote>It is my hope that if enacted, the new legislation will make travel between Ireland and the UK much easier, and qualifying people will no longer be required to present a passport when visiting the areas in question.  Instead, a valid driver's licence, a student card, a Garda age card or a work identification card including a photograph would be accepted by all airlines.<\/blockquote><p>While that would be most welcome, what would prevent an airline from requiring a passport in the parts of the common travel area outside the jurisdiction for which the Members of this House can legislate?  I understand that as part of Ryanair's new customer-friendly focus, its website now allows any photo identification which matches the passenger name in the booking to be used on UK domestic flights.  Like Aer Lingus, Ryanair allows children under the age of 16 who are travelling with an adult on UK domestic flights to travel without photo identification.  However, it is still putting limitations on flights between Ireland and the UK by allowing people to travel only if they are carrying a valid passport.  By contrast, CityJet allows people to travel with a driver's licence with photograph, a national identification card or a Government-issued photo identification card.  Ryanair says that travel between Ireland and the UK is international transit, which is true, but there are exceptions to all rules.  I suggest that it should respect the agreement that has been in place on these islands since the 1920s.<\/p><p>It is obvious that when one raises the subject of the common travel area, the subject of the United Kingdom's possible exit from the EU, or Brexit, cannot be far behind.  Our party has warned that if Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have a huge impact on Ireland and on the Border region in particular.  There is enormous concern that a Brexit could destabilise the relationship between Ireland and Britain as well as having serious consequences for our economy.  The implications of a Brexit are not confined to economic issues.  The fallout would be felt more severely in Ireland than in many other EU countries because we are the only country to have a land border with Britain.  There is concern that a Brexit could even see the reintroduction of EU border controls.  In the event of the UK exiting the European Union, Ireland's Border with Northern Ireland will be the UK's only land border with the EU.<\/p><p>Obviously, the common travel area, CTA, predates the European Union and indeed our membership of it.  As both Ireland and the UK joined the EU, or the EEC as it was then, at the same time, there was never any question about the continuation of the CTA.  In December 2011, the Irish and UK Governments agreed measures within the EU to secure the external CTA border.  A statement was signed working towards joint standards for entry and, ultimately, enhanced electronic border systems to identify those with no right to enter the CTA before they arrive at the border.  An accompanying memorandum also promoted the exchange of information such as fingerprint biometrics and biographical details, particularly from high-risk countries, as part of the visa-issuing process.  This data exchange aims to preventing abuses of the CTA arrangement while protecting the long-established benefits of trade and tourism.  It was hoped that it would create considerable savings for both countries on removing foreign nationals with no right to stay.  Nonetheless, a common travel area that includes an external EU border could well be significant and might raise considerable challenges for the open-border policy between the UK and Ireland.<\/p><p>We have to bear in mind that immigration is one of the key factors that underpins the antipathy to the EU in the UK.  The Conservative Party manifesto for the UK general election in May of this year berated the Labour Party Governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for &quot;their open borders policy&quot;.  The Tories suggested that &quot;for the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inherited&quot; and argued that &quot;our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands [but] that ambition remains the right one&quot;.  It is not impossible that issues with the CTA may arise over the next few years.  We will rightly retain our commitment to free movement within the EU.  I hope any obstacles will be overcome quickly.  I remind the House that Norway, which is not in the EU, and Sweden have free movement between them.  There is no reason that could not happen for Ireland and the UK in the event of a Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300013#L00200","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1447414800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>On the face of it, this Bill makes sense.  The requirement to present a passport for valid travel is one that has private origins within Ryanair.<\/p><p>If the Irish and British Governments have negotiated and agreed a common travel area for British and Irish citizens, Ryanair, or any other group, should not have the right to ignore that.  Irish citizens benefit when there is no requirement to use a passport when travelling to Britain.  Quite often, this is due to unfortunate circumstances within the State.  Historically, people in Ireland relied on the common travel area when taking the boat for both economic and social reasons.  The current cost of a standard ten-year passport is &euro;80.  This is more than the cost of some return flights to Britain and is a significant sum of money for many of those compelled to travel to Britain for pressing economic and social reasons.  <\/p> <p> Ryanair's requirement for passengers to present a passport makes sense from an internal efficiency viewpoint because its staff will have a limited number of ideas to be familiar with, to recognise and process.  From its point of view it is efficient to do so.  I assume it also reduces the number of scarce IT resources needed to record and process different types of identification and so reduces internal transaction costs.  This decision has the effect of displacing transaction costs to the external travelling populace.  Despite the special agreement between the Irish and British Governments, a private company is permitted to impose its own obligations on citizens who would otherwise be free to avail of the benefits of the common travel area.  At present, the travelling populace is compelled to produce a passport which obviates the possibility of using some other form of photographic ID such as driving licence, student ID, Garda vetting ID or social welfare ID.   The current position is detrimental to overall public welfare.<\/p> <p> Our European partners may have valid grounds for complaint if Ireland and Britain give each other advantages which they do not give to other EU countries and citizens.  I recall a colleague travelling with a European Parliament delegation to County Meath.  When they arrived in Dublin airport there was one channel at passport control from Ireland and Great Britain, one for the EU and a third for other countries.  A member of the delegation complained and the Ireland and Great Britain channel was subsequently removed.  Sinn F&eacute;in currently has no objection to this Bill because it clarifies in law that private companies must not compel travellers who are otherwise entitled to travel passport-free within the common travel area to carry a passport.<\/p> <p> We should not, as a matter of course, confer benefits on British citizens above and beyond those provided to other citizens within the EU.  Everyone accepts that some verifiable ID is essential but a passport should not be the only ID accepted by any aviation company or agency travelling between Britain and Ireland.  This contravenes the spirit of the common travel area agreement between our countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300013#L00300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447415400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, on introducing this very sensible Bill which addresses the operational clarity needed to make travel within the EU less confusing by having some sort of <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>operation.

Travel operators make their own assessments of the identity documents they require from passengers based on their business needs assessments which include matters to do with safety and security.  To legislate on this area requires these matters to be taken into account.

There is a difficulty and a lack of clarity in this area and that needs to be tidied up.  That is the reason this Bill has been introduced in the first instance.

There is confusion over this and it is not right that this is the case.<\/p><p>Irish citizens who travel to UK airports, and particularly to London, are sent through a separate channel at the airport; they are not sent through the channel designated for other people arriving from other destinations.  Therefore, an allowance is this respect is provided by UK airports but such an allowance in terms of a separate channel is not provided in Dublin Airport or in other Irish airports for citizens arriving from United Kingdom.<\/p><p>Other airlines flying between Ireland the United Kingdom do not mandate all passengers to carry passports but rather they require them to carry other relevant identification to match their name on the ticket.  The spirit of the common travel area is being broken by one particular airline and that needs to be challenged.  The Minister must come up with satisfactory legislation to deal with this issue, which has dragged on since the 1920s but has been particularly bad in recent years.<\/p><p>There is also the issue of the cost of a passport, which is &euro;95 over the counter and &euro;35 for a passport card.  That needs to be reviewed by the Government in terms of providing some type of exemption, particularly for pensioners, who are hard-pressed and have had a great deal of hardship imposed on them during the past eight years.  A measure needs to be introduced to ensure that people over the age of 65 are given a free passport.  That issue needs to be reviewed.  A constituent told me they had to get a passport when they were only travelling to the United Kingdom.  That person was not getting the full benefit of a passport and they were only doing it on a <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  That person is paying that level of cost for a document that they will not use very much.<\/p><p>As I referenced, there is case law in this respect, in that cases have been taken against the Minister for Justice and Equality such as Pachero <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality, which challenged the fact that the common travel area is not a real common travel area; that the spirit of it is not being adhered to.  That needs to change.  I ask the Minister to bring forward proper legislation to overhaul the current position to ensure that what pertains will be uniform and that carriers will all operate the same identification checks and that there is no discrimination depending on the airline with which one is travelling.<\/p><p>I thank, in particular, Graham Butler who is based in the faculty of law at the University of Copenhagen who was very helpful in bringing this issue to my attention and providing extra help in the drafting of this Bill and of some speaking points on it.  He has had an article published in the <i>Irish Jurist<\/i>on this issue, highlighting this is not a real common travel area, as highlighted in Pachero <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This area needs to be examined and hopefully it will be, as the Minister of State said, through the reform of the immigration laws.<\/p><p>I never in any way wanted to take from existing laws.  I acknowledge that we need to strengthen them, but there is a gap in the law, a grey area.  It is not nice if one is on the receiving end as a result of that.  If one does not have the proper identification, one is not able to travel and has to face the consequences of that.  Let us clear up this area once and for all.  I hope the Minister of State will ensure that the Minister clarifies this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111300015#N00100","speaker":"1206"},{"type":"speech","time":1447416000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the Bill be read a Second Time?
