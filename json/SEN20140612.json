When the Government came into power it stated it would usher in a new era of transparency, but the events of the past week have shown this was a hollow truth.  We are now witnessing political skulduggery at the very highest level.  Here is a situation where a democratically convened committee of selection, which adhered to all procedures, nominated two people onto the banking inquiry.  When the Government could not get its way, it acted like a child who does not get his or her way on the football field and picks up the ball and runs home with it.  It is bypassing the democratic process.  We on this side of the House will not agree to having these matters put on the Order Paper and passed through without debate.

I wish to put on the record once more that Fianna F&aacute;il is totally in support of the banking inquiry and we will co-operate in any way possible to ensure the real truth is got at under the terms of reference, whatever they may be.  What I found astonishing about the Taoiseach's comments in recent days is that he plainly and openly stated on the record of the D&aacute;il that he was not in favour, or was opposed to, the democratic decision arrived at by the committee of selection of this House because he wanted a Government majority to ensure the terms of reference would be according to what the Government wants the terms of reference to be.  In other words, the committee members should be good little muppets and do what the Government tells them to do and come up with the type of conclusions the Government wants.  This is essentially the message being sent out to the general public.<br \/>There is an old story about digging a hole.  The Government has continued to dig the hole and has not stopped digging.

Senator Crown raised issues yesterday, but the Department of Health, the HSE and the new hospital groups, between them are starting to grind the health service to a halt.  It is essential that we move now, not after the summer recess and not coming up to Christmas when one will probably see an enormous slashing of services and closing of wards that will put people in extreme distress.  These are the real issues we need to be dealing with.  I ask that this happen as quickly as possible and that we go through figures and facts, some of which were raised yesterday.  I am sure, if one goes through this Chamber, we will all be able to itemise areas of services not just where there are waiting lists but which have stopped.  The sooner we get back to real business of representing the people, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200004#C00200","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1402569600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I second the proposal to amend the Order of Business as set out by my colleague, Senator Mooney.

As I stated here previously, due to what has happened so far through no fault of some on this side of the House, there is structural damage done to the banking inquiry before it starts.

There is a whiff of communist Russia in what is being heard this morning.  As big as the banking inquiry may be, this is a much bigger issue altogether because it strikes at the foundation of democracy.  Many people in Europe marvelled at why Ireland did not have more anti-social street protests over the economic collapse.  When one considers what people suffered, people in Ireland are still getting up in the morning and wondering whether they will have a roof over their heads - because they cannot pay their mortgage - next week.  People are still trying to raise a family, send them to school, clothe them, feed them and do the best for them on a couple of hundred euro each week.

Late last night we heard of the resignation of Mr. Noel Daly as the chair of the west north-west hospital group.  It is something we called for last week.  The Minister did not give us the full information regarding Mr. Daly's position as chair.  It is quite obvious to us that there was a conflict of interest in the awarding of a contract, ostensibly to his own company.  It is important that he did step down because there was a certain conflict of interest there.  Mr. Daly's resignation also raises further questions that the Minister has to ask himself.<\/p><p>The Minister should attend this House to answer our questions.  How was Mr. Daly appointed?  Why was the Minister not more cognisant that there was a potential conflict of interest when appointing Mr. Daly to the board?  Why was the public appointments process not used to appoint the chair of a board which manages seven hospitals and has a budget of hundreds of millions of euro?<\/p><p>Most important, the review of maternity services, which is where this debacle started, should be scrapped at this stage.  It is quite obvious that it must be a tainted document if the procurement process was not undertaken properly.

There are people in serious medical situations who cannot access the services they require.

Serious lessons should have been learned from the debacle that has gone on over recent years with regard to the dysfunctionality of many public services.  Unfortunately, that lesson seems to have been completely lost on the Government parties.  Many people have suffered as a result of the banking collapse and the manner in which prudential banking was abandoned by people who were really greasing their own palms with bonuses.  As a consequence, many people are in distress and some have committed suicide.  We owe it to those we represent to have a banking inquiry that has integrity and public confidence.  This approach, however, has totally undermined that, particularly with the comments of the Taoiseach.

Our distinguished guest today is the first Luxembourger and only the second woman to take up the post of the president of the assembly.  Ms Brasseur, I congratulate you on your election as president earlier this year.  I know the sessions she has already presided over have been eventful.  This month&rsquo;s session will be no less so with the election of a secretary general setting the scene for the work of the Council for the next five years.<\/p><p>The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which held its first session in 1949, can be considered the oldest international parliamentary assembly with the pluralistic composition of democratically elected members of parliaments, established on the basis of an intergovernmental treaty.  Ireland is a founding member state of the Council of Europe and is deeply committed to the principles and values to which all member states subscribe.  Our historical and more recent experience gives us a relevant background on which we can draw in debate and activities.  The Irish delegation attending the Council of Europe sessions on behalf of the Oireachtas is highly dedicated, participating fully in plenary and committee meetings.<\/p><p>The Parliamentary Assembly meets for week-long plenary sessions in Strasbourg four times a year.  The 321 principal members and 321 substitutes are appointed by national parliaments from among their members.  The parliament of each country sends a delegation of between two and 18 representatives, depending on the country&rsquo;s population and which must reflect the balance of political forces in the parliament.  Under current rules, at least one representative must be female.  The assembly is a unique platform for interparliamentary dialogue, communication and engagement.  It is central to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  Given the great economic, financial, environmental and social challenges that Ireland and Europe face, it is important we continue to engage, exchange ideas and work together as democratic nations to resolve the issues that face us and foster a Europe that works in the interests of its citizens.<\/p><p>In her office, Ms Brasseur plays an important role in helping to stimulate that dialogue.  Today, we will have an opportunity to hear her vision and priorities for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  The Seanad, the future of which was recently endorsed by the people in a referendum, is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with civic society and its representative institutions.  Our discussion today with Ms Brasseur is tangible evidence of that determination.<\/p><p>On behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I thank Ms Brasseur for agreeing to appear before the House and welcome her.  We look forward to her presentation, as well as a positive and enlightening discussion.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, leader of the Irish delegation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the work of his colleagues Deputies Michael McNamara and Olivia Mitchell and Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, Terry Leyden and Kathryn Reilly and a former Member of the House Deirdre Clune, who is now a MEP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200016#P00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402574700,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh, and Senators.  I am very honoured to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann in this fine historic building, Leinster House.  It is the first time that I have addressed a parliament outside my own and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  This is an honour for me and I thank the Seanad for the kind invitation to address it.<\/p><p>The Seanad has had and continues to have many illustrious Members.  W. B. Yeats may be one of the most well-known.  Senator Norris, currently a Member of this esteemed institution, has a firm place in Strasbourg history as one of the successful early human rights litigants whose case helped bring major changes to laws and attitudes towards LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, issues in Europe.  The Irish are famed for their hospitality, their openness and friendliness.  While I only started my official visit yesterday, already I feel at home in a country which has many similarities to my own.  Luxembourg has kept its own language, Luxembourgish.  Ireland has kept its own language, Gaelic.  Both countries are cosmopolitan and open to diversity.  What makes me feel most at home is that the Seanad is made up of 60 Members, the same size as the Chamber of Deputies in Luxembourg.<\/p><p>It is a great pleasure to address the Seanad on some of Europe&rsquo;s pressing political issues and the role and contribution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  I also feel at home today because Ireland is one of the great supporters of the ideals of the Council of Europe and its values based around the rule of law, democracy and human rights.  Support for these ideals is not to be taken for granted at a time of economic woes, political upheavals and troubling security issues.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the organisation can be seen in many ways: the professionalism of its diplomats and experts in Strasbourg; the contribution of its parliamentarians under the chairmanship of Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly; its involvement in campaigns such as those to combat domestic violence, child abuse and trafficking of human beings; its application of the European Convention on Human Rights; and its co-operation with the monitoring bodies of the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>Ireland has a unique and troubled history which it has surmounted.  The 1998 Good Friday Agreement gives hope and example of how to tackle and overcome frozen and other conflicts in Europe.  As president of the assembly, I cannot ignore these conflicts.  That is why the issue of conflict features strongly in my address.  In Europe, there are plenty of conflict regions that deserve our attention including Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria and the northern part of Cyprus.  From Ireland&rsquo;s experience of conflict settlements, we can certainly benefit.<\/p><p>One conflict which is already having a bearing on the whole of Europe is that between Ukraine and Russia.  As I said last month in Vienna when addressing the foreign affairs Ministers of Council of Europe member states, the three most important challenges facing the Council today are Ukraine, Ukraine and Ukraine.  The conflict is a test of the credibility of our organisation.  It is also a test of our ability to support a member state facing an unprecedented political crisis not only internally, but also at its borders.  During the February 2014 Maidan events in Kiev, the rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Assembly&rsquo;s monitoring committee were on the square, providing daily updates on the situation.  A week after Russia annexed Crimea, I visited Ukraine together with political leaders and rapporteurs.<\/p> <p>During the visit we went to Donetsk in the east, which is, unfortunately, in the news almost daily.  There, I met the governor of the region in the administrative building currently occupied and sand bagged by so-called separatist forces.  In March, there were already anti-government demonstrations and a number of demonstrators chanted at me, \"Fashistskaya Europa\".  While I do not understand Russian, I understood those words.  While the demonstrations were peaceful, it showed a level of frustration and distrust of Europe.<\/p><p>As the Members are aware, events in Ukraine moved quickly with the annexation of Crimea, the build up of Russian troops at the border and the occupation of government buildings by the so-called separatists.  The parliamentary assembly had to react.  During the April part-session, the assembly sought to stand up for the values of the organisation and took difficult and principled decisions, which its founders would have expected of it.  In Resolution 1988 (2014) on recent developments in Ukraine, the assembly made it clear that Ukraine had a heavy responsibility but also a window of opportunity to tackle corruption and bring about real constitutional change, electoral reform, decentralisation and a reform of the judiciary.  However, this resolution was overshadowed by discussions on Russia's annexation of Crimea and the increasingly worrying events in eastern Ukraine.<\/p><p>Actions have consequences.  The assembly laid out the consequences for Russia in Resolution 1990 (2014) and I would like to be clear on what the assembly did and did not do.  Concerning the Russian delegation, it suspended voting rights, the possibility of being represented in the bureau and presidential committee of the assembly - meaning the executive bodies - and the right to participate in election observations.  It did not, however, suspend the credentials of the Russian delegation, allowing for an ongoing dialogue whereby the Russian delegation could continue to participate in the other work of the assembly.<\/p><p>Our actions had consequences.  In light of the assembly's sanctions, the Russian State Duma has reacted by suspending &quot;its further constructive participation in the PACE activities&quot;.  It is unlikely its parliamentarians will attend the June part-session of the assembly.  Since these resolutions, the situation in Ukraine has not improved.  On the contrary, the death toll has increased and there have been tragic events such as the fire and loss of life at the trade union building in Odessa.  There have been allegations of atrocities, kidnappings and hostage-taking and there are daily military interventions.  This cannot continue.  A week ago, I spoke to the speaker of the Russian State Duma, Mr. Sergei Naryshkin, to see how channels of communication can be kept open with a view to ending the violence.  While these discussions were frank and open, I cannot say there was much progress apart from an agreement to meet and talk in the future.<\/p><p>While Ukraine may be Europe's Pandora's box, we hope at the bottom of the box there is hope.  There are prospects that the new president of Ukraine, Mr. Petro Poroshenko, will be able to forge a new dialogue with Russia and the separatists in the east.  On the home front, he has a mandate to build on the reform process, as I already mentioned.  I have invited President Poroshenko to address the assembly at the end of the month in Strasbourg, and I hope he will be able to come.  This conflict will challenge our conflict settlement skills.  Irish parliamentarians, with their experience, will have something to contribute in future discussions on the issue.  Perhaps we also can learn from the words of James Joyce: &quot;Your battles inspired me - not the obvious material battles but those that were fought and won behind your forehead.&quot;<\/p><p>There are other major challenges for Europe, such as the financial and economic crisis, and Ireland has shown courage in tackling its problems and building trust in its financial institutions.  This has not come without political cost and, above all, immense personal cost to many Irish men and women who have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices.  Across Europe, the financial and economic crisis has also engendered a social crisis.  It is, therefore, essential that fundamental social rights, such as those under the European Social Charter, are respected in difficult times, particularly for those most vulnerable.<\/p><p>While Ireland may be, in many ways, a model member state, there are still steps it can take.  In the recent report on the state of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Europe, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe highlighted that Ireland must consider ratifying or signing seven further conventions.  I particularly mention the Lanzarote convention concerning sexual abuse of children, the Istanbul convention tackling domestic violence, Protocol No. 12 of the European Convention of Human Rights relating to non-discrimination and conventions concerning money laundering and cyber crime.  I do not need to explain the relevance of these conventions.<\/p><p>Regarding the other conventions ratified by Ireland, the spirit of co-operation of Irish authorities is to be welcomed.  Nonetheless, it is important that recommendations from these bodies are fully implemented whether they concern migrants, with the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance; detainees with the reports of European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; Irish Travellers in the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; or issues under other mechanisms.  One of the priorities for my presidency is to help member states live up to their commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and not to patronise but to help as we are helping all countries to meet their commitments.<\/p><p>If all countries could show Ireland's level of commitment, Europe would be a better place.  Before the European Court, Ireland has a reputation of being willing to do business.  This means settling cases where appropriate and fighting hard on cases where most important issues of principle are concerned.  This is as it should be.  Ireland has relatively few cases and this is not due to luck but because the European Convention on Human Rights is well rooted in Ireland's domestic law and strengthened further by the incorporation of the convention into domestic law in 2003.<\/p><p>I refer to the difficult and sensitive issue of abortion and how the Seanad and D&aacute;il handled it in light of the A, B and C judgment against Ireland.  Both Houses organised a hearing in the Seanad over several days, collecting evidence from different parties and sectors with a view to preparing legislation.  This is a model of parliamentary co-operation and engagement in order to bring domestic law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Notwithstanding that Ireland has had to deal with judgments of extreme sensitivity, this has been done without a backlash against the convention and the European Court.<\/p> <p>The country has taken its international obligations seriously and has not sought a pick and choose approach to human rights, because one cannot pick and choose human rights.  Ireland has also been highly supportive of the European court in other ways, including by funding for the benefit of all webcasting of hearings before the court.  If I may make one suggestion, it would be for Ireland to consider inviting its Government agent and Attorney General to speak to both Houses once a year on the implications of case law developments for Irish law and practice.<\/p><p>I was pleased to learn that, after the recent referendum in Ireland, the future of the Seanad is no longer in question.  In preparing for this visit I came across an article published several years ago in which the author spoke about those who wanted the Seanad to go away and stated of these people they are &quot;the bores of the world - the &quot;monotony monitors&quot;... who travel the four corners of the globe seeking out remaining pockets of individuality and interesting-ness to be standardised into boredom or else abolished.&quot;  I hope none of us will be standardised into boredom and that pockets of individuality and interestingness will continue.

It is a great pleasure to welcome Ms Brasseur to Ireland.<\/p><p>Since her election as President in January of this year she has been outstanding in the role.  In particular, her handling of the difficult debates on Ukraine, and particularly the debates on possible sanctions on Russia, was excellent.  The situation regarding Russia and its Ukranian policy is a big issue.  The Council of Europe, which comprises 47 countries, is the principal human rights and democracy body for the wider Europe and as such has a very important role.  It places enormous responsibility on the Parliamentary Assembly to be the voice of reason in this debate and I am pleased that, whereas certain voting rights were taken from the Russian delegation, the option of expelling Russia or cancelling its credentials from the Council of Europe was rejected.  It is very important that communication is kept open with Russia, and the Council of Europe is one of the few organisations where east meets west.  I urge Ms Brasseur to continue dialogue with the Duma members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE, and to continue with her contacts at ambassadorial level.  I am delighted the leader of the Irish members of PACE, Deputy Joe O'Reilly is here.  I hope someday we will propose him for the presidency of PACE but that is in the future.<\/p><p>The Ukrainian situation is very sad.  There were recent signs of movement, if not improvement, and I hope these will bear fruit and conflict can be avoided.<\/p><p>There have been some concerns about human rights issues in Azerbaijan.  It is very important that these concerns are addressed, particularly as the question of the chairmanship of Azerbaijan of the ministerial council arises.  I know that Ms Brasseur is using her good offices in this regard.<\/p><p>Since being appointed to the Council of Europe, I have had the privilege to attend plenary sessions.  Last week, I attended the meeting of the culture, education, media and science committee in Paris.  We discussed a number of issues, including a report from Mr. Piotr Wach from Poland on raising the status of vocational education and training.  This is an issue dear to our hearts and Ireland has recently legislated in this regard with the Education and Training Boards Bill and the Bill on further education and training establishing a new and better delivery structure.  We need to monitor this education constantly so that our people throughout Europe get the best possible training and education.  These people are the backbone of our country.  As a former education Minister in her native Luxembourg, Ms Brasseur has always had a deep interest in and concern about vocational education and training and I encourage her particularly to support Mr. Wach's report as it goes through its various stages.<\/p><p>When the Council of Europe was established in 1949, Ireland was a founder member.  Yesterday, I had lunch with the grandson of the Taoiseach at the time, John A. Costello. who said his grandfather considered bringing Ireland into the Council of Europe as a founding member one of his most important achievements.  I have absolute confidence in Ms Brasseur's ability to lead the Council of Europe in all the amazing directions it is going at present.  I assure her once again of our full and committed support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200018#R00600","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1402575900,"counter":388,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I am honoured to welcome Ms Brasseur to the Upper House.  It is an historic day not only for us, but, as she outlined, for her as she is addressing a full Parliament during her tenure as president.<\/p><p>As was already outlined, Ireland is a founder member of the Council of Europe and has a very proud history and tradition of participation in it.  I could not help but reflect on the circumstances in which the Council of Europe came together in 1949, in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War when human rights had been trampled and the concept of human rights had not been developed.  It is to the credit of those founding fathers that they set down concepts at the time which have resonated to the present day.<\/p><p>It is in this context that I was particularly interested in Ms Brasseur's remarks about the relationship between the Council of Europe and Russia.  I applaud her efforts in this regard.  As she outlined, and she was probably somewhat restrained, it is one of the most serious crises to affect Europe since the Second World War.  I am curious to know how she thinks it will develop in the coming weeks and months.  The fact she has invited the newly elected president of Ukraine to address the Parliamentary Assembly is worthwhile.  There seems to be some movement between Russia and Ukraine in terms of trying to lessen tensions.  Ms Brasseur has been pivotal to the discussions and developments in recent months and I am curious to know her overall view.<\/p> <p>Regarding Russia and the Council of Europe, I am particularly pleased the Parliamentary Assembly stopped short of withdrawing the credentials of the Russian members.  It is very important that dialogue continues.  As Winston Churchill said, \"to jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\".  As Senator Jim D'Arcy said, the Council of Europe is one of the few pan-European organisations where East and West come together.  I was a member of the Council of Europe from 2002 until 2008 and Russia played an active role and saw the Council as an important connection to the rest of Europe.  Russia would not wish to do anything that could endanger its status in that regard.  It is good that while a marker was laid down by the sanctions imposed, the Council stopped short of withdrawing Russia's credentials.  It was a wise decision because to do so would not have solved anything.<\/p><p>Does Ms Brasseur have any views on the future role of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe?  I know this matter has been under discussion for some years, particularly since 2004 and the enlargement of the European Union.  Many former Soviet Union satellite countries saw the Council of Europe as the most important part of their external policies.  They were active members of the Council but this has weakened since they joined the European Union.  From 2004 to 2008, I got the impression those countries were less committed to the Council of Europe because they had become members of the European Union.  Within the European Union, the need for the Council of Europe was questioned because the EU was founded on the same concepts, such as human rights and fairness and equality for all.  What relationship does the Council of Europe now have with the European Union?<\/p><p>I am sure Ms Brasseur will agree that the evolving situation in Ukraine and Russian involvement in that crisis have made other countries nervous, particularly neighbouring countries.  This applies to the disputed territories in Moldova and Transnistria and also to the territories mentioned by Ms Brasseur in places such as Nagorno-Karabakh.  Should we be more concerned about these situations?<\/p><p>I again welcome Ms Brasseur to the House and to Ireland.  I am glad she has enjoyed her time here and I hope she returns soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200018#R00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402576500,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I welcome the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Ms Brasseur, and thank her for her address to this House.  She has opened the eyes of some of us, including myself, who did not know a great deal about the Council of Europe.  Other Members of the Houses, including Deputy O'Reilly and Senator Mooney, know a great deal more about the Council and have much experience of it.  I will give Ms Brasseur an opportunity to add to what she has said.  Could we have a brief overview of five achievements of the Parliamentary Assembly in the past year?  Russia will play a large part in this and I understand the crisis in Ukraine must have put huge pressure on the Council of Europe.  Will the lack of trust that has grown between Russia and Ukraine damage the Council of Europe?  If Russia withdraws its &euro;23 million contribution to the Council, which it has not yet done, will it mean the Council will be unable to function as competently as in the past?<\/p><p>Ireland has been involved in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  That organisation has several hundred people involved in the Ukraine crisis.  Is there a danger the Council of Europe will duplicate this work or will its work complement that of the OSCE?<\/p><p>What is Ms Brasseur's view on the rise of extremism in Europe?  This is a concern for everyone, though extremism varies depending on the country.  Some countries have shifted sharply to the right and some to the left.  Can we learn from this and what can we do about it?<\/p><p>What deficits in legislation does the assembly see in Ireland?

My background is in children's rights and I have long admired the work of the Council of Europe.  In fact my first experience in the area came 25 years ago with the then youth directorate, now youth department, of the Council of Europe.  I became familiar with the way it trained future youth leaders and I thank the Council of Europe for this experience.  It is good to see that this work continues today and that there is a system of co-management in the area of youth policy.  This means youth non-governmental organisations, NGOs, work with officials from member states to determine budgets and programmes for young people.  Member states should note how the Council of Europe has succeeded in engaging with those it funds to reach democratic decisions.<\/p><p>I commend the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on its work and the emphasis it has placed on children's rights.  We must build a Europe with children for children.  The Council's work has been a forerunner of much of what has been done at EU level.  The Council has worked on children in care and child-friendly justice but the EU's work in this regard has been protectionist.  The Council's work on child-friendly justice is remarkable and I draw from it often in my work in the Seanad.  I am glad that experts such as Ursula Kilkelly play a leading role on this work in the Council of Europe.  <\/p><p>Ms Brassuer mentioned work on domestic violence and child abuse and the importance of Ireland ratifying the Lanzarote Convention and the Istanbul Convention, among others.  We must live up to our roles.  One of the benefits of having this debate with Ms Brasseur present is we can discuss the future role of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  <\/p><p>The Council of Europe is a good forum for discussing issues such as youth policy, children's rights, child-friendly justice and domestic violence.  All too often it may take years for the EU to then pick up on this and often in a pick and mix way without the integrity of the Council of Europe.  I echo what Senator Mooney said as it is something I am also thinking about.  Perhaps Members of this House should discuss this rather than just being bystanders because we have a role as parliamentarians to support the colleagues that represent us in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>I thank Ms Brasseur for acknowledging our colleague, Senator David Norris.  She reminds us to be proud of the role he played.  He did something of historic importance and used the European Convention on Human Rights in a very positive way.  We should continue to draw reference from this fact.  Can Ireland be a leader rather than a follower?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200019#S00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1402576500,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Brasseur, President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhat.  I am afraid I do not speak Luxembourgish but I thank her for speaking Irish in the Chamber.  It is an honour to have her here and I welcome Deputy O'Reilly, the leader of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.<\/p> <p> It is very good to hear about the work being done by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  In Ireland, we are all much more familiar with the work of the European Court of Human Rights.  Senator van Turnhout and others have mentioned some of the significant cases that have been taken to the European Court of Human Rights by Irish citizens which have had a huge impact on our society - a positive impact - such as Senator Norris's case which was acknowledged.<\/p><p>The court also ruled on the case of Louise O'Keeffe in January.  The case has been hugely important in terms of establishing the need to ensure that there are adequate remedies available for those who were victims of sexual abuse as children in schools.  That case has had an important impact in Ireland too. <\/p><p>Ms Brasseur mentioned the A, B and C case which has also had a major impact here.  The hearings she mentioned were held in this Chamber and were widely commended as an exemplary model of a pre-legislative stage for drafting Bills.  <\/p><p>I pay tribute to the work that she has done within the legislative wing of the Parliamentary Assembly which she spoke about.  She also referred to the positive steps that have been taken regarding Ukraine.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout spoke about Ms Brasseur's work on children's rights.  I am interested in some of the work being done on equality issues, particularly the announcement this month by the Parliamentary Assembly of the launch of the No Hate Parliamentary Alliance.  Senator Quinn mentioned the rise of extremism across Europe.  I note that Ms Brasseur spoke about the need to launch a No Hate Parliamentary Alliance to commit parliamentarians to taking an open, firm and proactive stands against racism, hatred and intolerance.  She also stressed the crucial role played by politicians in combating hate speech, particularly at a time of economic and financial crises because such crises offer fertile grounds for a climate that distils hate.  That is a very good example of the sort of positive work that the Parliamentary Assembly can do and is doing.  I thank her to coming here and telling us about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200019#S00400","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402577100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I welcome President Brasseur to the Seanad and to Dublin.  I hope she enjoys her short stay.  I commend her on the work that she is doing in Europe and on her comprehensive contribution to the Seanad today.<\/p><p>I wish to pick up on a number of the issues and themes that she raised and to support some of them.  The first issue is the rights of the Traveller community in this State.  We have a long way to go in terms of the responsibility of this State towards Travellers.  I would welcome Ms Brasseur's thoughts on what practical steps the State could take to protect the rights of Travellers.<\/p><p>With regard to migrant groups, we can agree in general that we need burden sharing across Europe as regards the issue of illegal migrants.  I am concerned about the rise of far right groups across Europe and their very anti-immigration position.  Thankfully, we do not have that same situation in this State but we can see it happening in other states across Europe.  A lot of issues feed into the rise of such groups which has little to do with immigration and more to do with economic issues in those states.  The situation is very worrying.  I agree with Senator Quinn that the rise of the far right is something that should worry us all.  I would like to hear Ms Brasseur's view on that matter. <\/p><p>My party and I have previously raised the issue of direct provision for asylum seekers.  They are provided for directly in what are called reception centres.  However, they do not have the right to work or many other rights.  It is a policy of out of sight and out of mind, with very little integration in the wider society.  Very often, these people must wait years for asylum to be granted and while they wait for the process to be completed, they are kept in reception centres.  In some cases, the management in the centres is questionable.  What is Ms Brasseur's opinion on the overall policy and where Ireland can improve?<\/p><p>We are all concerned about the unstable and volatile situation in Ukraine.  I agree that the annexation of Crimea by Russia was not legitimate for all sorts of reasons.  However, I am concerned about one of the reasons given by the EU for not supporting it, which was the constitution in Ukraine.  A referendum will take place in Catalonia and Spain's constitution does not allow for a region to secede from the Spanish state.  This constitution was drawn up by Franco.  In my view, the majority of people in the region support independence.  Therefore, the EU should be open to the idea and supportive of the democratic right of citizens, once elections and referendums are fair and not under pressure from a military occupation, which is what happened in Ukraine.  There was also a very short lead in to the referendum and all sorts of other issues in Ukraine.  I am concerned about an inconsistency of approach in Europe and I ask Ms Brasseur for her opinion in this regard.  I wish her well for her short stay here in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200020#T00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1402577100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The president has five minutes to respond to a number of questions, if she wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200020#T00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402577100,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Trying to answer them will be the most difficult task of my trip to Ireland.<\/p><p>Concerning Russia, it is true that we must keep open the corridors of dialogue.  We can also learn from Ireland about how it met challenges during its history and overcame serious crises through dialogue.  On the one hand, there must be sanctions but, on the other, there must be dialogue.  One must speak and listen to one another, even if one does not agree.  One must try to understand the other argument and sit down to find solutions.  Dialogue only works, however, if both sides want to find a solution and, of course, we cannot force anybody to do it.<\/p><p>Azerbaijan has taken over the chairmanship.  I was very critical of it in my opening address at the standing committee a fortnight ago in Baku.  One must be critical but I also see the chairmanship as a window of opportunity for Azerbaijan to accelerate its reform process.  The country has lots to do and we must address the situation.  That is not patronising, just helping countries to reach and cope with the commitments they undertook when they joined the Council of Europe.  <\/p><p>The important issue of vocational training was mentioned.  I am glad the Council of Europe took up the issue because we need people in Europe who are hands-on and know how young people treat things.  One can delocalise jobs in other parts but there is work that must be done on the spot which is where we need qualified people.  I believe in the importance of vocational training and I am glad that we are going to adopt the resolution of Mr. Wach. <\/p><p>With regard to human rights in 1949, our predecessors had a vision.  They understood that the Second World War was the result of not finding the right solutions after the First World War.  After the Second World War they sat down and decided to have a pan-European organisation that would defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  We tended to take that for granted.  When we look at what is happening today, one can see that it is more important than ever to focus on that.  One cannot have stable countries and strong institutions without a democratic system.  One cannot have a democratic system if one does not have human rights and a system based on the rule of law.  We must continue to work together to defend this.  <\/p><p>I was asked how the situation between Russia and Ukraine will develop.  I do not know, and nobody else knows, but there is some hope.  I hope that we continue the dialogue in order to find solutions.<\/p> <p>Members spoke also about the neighbouring countries and Moldova.  In a fortnight's time, after the session, I am going to Moldova to meet the people because it is important that they feel the support of the Council of Europe.  I do not pretend to solve the problem of Transnistria but I want to assure them that they belong to the European family.<br \/>In regard to relations with the EU, I always say that the Council of Europe cannot be seen as a waiting room for the European Union.  We have to focus on our core business which is human rights in the 47 member states which means the whole geographical Europe, except Kosovo and Belarus.  While the European Union decided to join the European Convention on Human Rights we still have some way to go.  That is important.  We have also agreements where the European Union is funding action plans of the Council of Europe, especially in neighbouring countries in, for example, the Maghreb states. <br \/>On the achievements of the Council of Europe, there were serious crises in countries such as Albania where the opposition refused to sit in the parliament, making it impossible to work, because it needed a qualified majority in order to get started.  As a Council of Europe and as a parliamentary assembly we went to Albania and spoke to the people and we contributed.  We did not solve the problem because they had to solve it themselves but we contributed to finding solutions.  The same happened in Romania when they tried to force President <font color=\"#222222\">B\u0103sescu<\/font>to step down.  We also made a contribution there not to mention all the conventions.<br \/>On the issue of finances, it is true that the Council of Europe is getting less money because we have a zero nominal gross budget but we have to continue to get money.  I do not think the Russians will withdraw and not pay any more.  <br \/>There was a question about the OSCE.  I called on the Secretary General of the OSCE as we have to maintain relations.  The OSCE is responsible for security issues and we are responsible for human rights.  We cannot develop human rights without security and we cannot have sound security without human rights, therefore, we have to continue to work closer together.<br \/>Several Senators raised the issue of the extremists in Europe.  That issue is more than worrisome.  I appeal to all democratic parties, despite our political differences in many areas, to stick together in order to combat extremism because that is very dangerous especially with the economic crisis in all our countries.  As that is easy for all those populists, so we have to come back to that issue.  We know how it worked in the 1930s where people said it was not that dangerous.  One has only to look at what happened in Greece to the Government's own party.  I was told that was because of the economic crisis and protest voters but it made 16% in essence at the local elections.  Therefore, we must stick together in order to combat extremists.<br \/>I turn to children's rights and protection.  Ireland can make efforts to join the conventions to make them even stronger.  The role and future of the Council of Europe is to focus on structuring human rights.  I come back to Ukraine where one of its the problems is that it has very weak institutions and weak institutions are not able to provide answers to a serious crisis.  It starts with a constitution, corruption, and the justice is not independent.  This shows the importance of having those core values deeply rooted in every country.  Through its instruments this is where the Council of Europe can help those countries.  The No Hate Parliamentary Alliance is also linked to the extremists, therefore we have to stick together.  <br \/>The last report of the Commissioner for Human Rights of 2011 dealt with Traveller community rights but time does not permit me to go into its details.  However, it points to some of the ways to tackle the issue.  I advise the House to work on that issue as well on asylum seekers and refugees.  The migration issue should be a focus of all member states where a common policy is needed, otherwise this also will help the extremist parties to get more support.  Given that it has been stated that migrants are responsible for everything, we need to find an answer to that question.<br \/>The final question is territorial integrity, self-determination.  How far can it go?  Ireland is a neighbour with Scotland.  If it agrees that the forthcoming referendum there is fair and meets all the requirements that can be a solution but it has to be in the framework of the constitution, in line with all international requirements and not left to an upcoming populist party which would split a country and make it weaker and more vulnerable. <br \/>I have tried to answer all the questions.  I wish to close with one word in Luxembourgish, Villmols merci, go raibh maith agat. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200020#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Brasseur","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402577700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I invite the Leader to propose a vote of thanks to Ms Anne Brasseur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200021#U00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1402577700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Anne Brasseur for her excellent address and response to the Members of the House.

We discussed the matter with the Minister and he has drawn our attention to the disadvantages, etc., that could arise.<br \/>The case we were making, the Minister may recall, is that Cork Airport is substantially bigger than Shannon Airport in terms of passenger numbers.  I suppose there was an inherent hope that Cork Airport on its own could operate as a successful competing airport versus scepticism that, run as an appendage to Dublin, it would ever achieve the kind of freedom to which Cork people, as an independent republic of Cork, always aspire.<br \/>Cork Airport would rank in the top 20 airports in the United Kingdom, many of which operate independently.  As the Minister explained to us on the previous occasion, there is the problem of what to do with the value of the terminal, at &euro;168 million.  I suppose we would hope that the Cork Airport Authority would not be dissolved, that the problem of the terminal might be resolved in a number of years and it could get on with being an independent airport competing against Shannon.  In other words, I compliment the Minister for what he has done for Shannon.  He has given it its independence.  Senator Conway, in particular, is a great advocate of Shannon's independence in this House and we wish it well.  I would like something similar for Cork.<br \/>I recognise the problem of what to do with a terminal which was built and opened at the wrong time, and is a millstone around somebody's neck.  The DAA can take that millstone because it is a larger organisation.  Could it remain with the DAA?  Can we find somebody who might use it for some other purpose?  Not being entirely facetious, when there was surplus terminal capacity in Kerry airport at one stage, the Klinge company of Killorglin used it for storage.  I would seek to avoid it sitting there as a white elephant preventing the development of Cork.<br \/>That is the purpose of these amendments.  It is as it were to ask the Minister, as he has been so skillful in accommodating the amendments in regard to the publication of directives, if he has a magic formula which would allow Cork the same administrative structure as Shannon, develop itself, attract new airlines and promote itself rather than be a branch of Dublin Airport.<br \/>With the break-up of national airport authorities - the British airports authority used to run seven, eight, nine or ten of them in the United Kingdom - airports are becoming separate stand-alone businesses competing with each other.  This is happening in an environment, as the Minister mentioned on the previously occasion, where airlines are much more competitive than they used to be under the non-competing national airline model.  I and many Cork people would like to see Cork participate to the full extent in that regard.<br \/>That is the purpose of our amendments, to not proceed with the dissolution of the Cork Airport Authority in the hope that sometime in the next couple of years we might work out a formula by which it could be a separate independent airport and help the entire economy.  With it and Shannon Airport competing it would ensure that neither of them would have the kind of productivity problems that they had in the past, and they might be a little more careful about their investment plans as well.<br \/>That is the problem we were trying to solve.  I see a much better future for Cork as an independent airport on the Shannon model, that the Minister has so persuasively advocated here and that we support.  Could something be done for Cork along similar lines?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200022#V01300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1402578300,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett expressed the concept well.  I am a believer in independence in such matters.  I have had the chance in the past year to visit Ireland West Airport Knock to see the enthusiasm for what can happen there and what they can do.  I note they are raising a charge on flights where everybody departing has to pay &euro;10 or &euro;20, but it seems to be working.  I do not know whether they are making money yet, but there are so many other aspects to this.  One of the actions we took when we were working on that was to go to the John Lennon Airport in Liverpool to see what it has done and how it changed when, having been part of a bigger structure, it got independence.  Recently I visited Southend Airport in the south of England to see the efforts it is putting in on that basis as well.<\/p><p>If one has the commitment of the local area to independence, I believe much can be done.  It would be a shame to end up involving Cork Airport with a much larger institution where it will always be a second-class citizen.

At a time in the future, when Cork Airport is stronger, when its operating costs match its income and when a solution has been found to the terminal debt, it may well be possible to separate Cork Airport.  While this may make sense at that time, it must also make sense in terms of the Dublin Airport Authority's balance sheet.  This section is about dissolving the Cork Airport Authority plc, which is a company that has existed for quite some time but which has no assets and no real power.  It really is merely an edifice and I see little point in continuing that.  Even for the directors who served on it, many of whom were excellent directors, it simply did not make sense for them either to have in place this shadow company that did not actually have an airport to run.  This section dissolves that company but allows for its re-establishment at a point further down the road when it is for real.  The purpose of this section is to get rid of the pretence but it does not preclude the re-establishment of the Cork Airport Authority if and when the time is right to opt for the separation of Cork.<\/p><p>However, on an administrative basis what I can do is to change the title of section 31 from &quot;Dissolution of Cork Airport Authority&quot; to &quot;Cork Airport Authority&quot;, just for clarity.  I believe Senator Barrett had proposed something along those lines previously.  However, I can discern no case in keeping in operation a shadow company with no airport to run and doing nothing.  Until the Government figures out what to do with Cork, it makes sense to close it now and then re-establish it at a later point when there is a clear plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200023#W00600","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1402578900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I hope this happens quickly - I believe it would happen faster were it an independent body, but at least the Bill's wording now provides for a future for the Cork Airport Authority, rather than for the dissolution thereof.  Consequently, I welcome the Minister's proposed change in this regard.  All of us who have Munster connections wish this would happen sooner rather than later, as I am sure does the Minister as well, because it would mean the debt burden would be reduced by attracting more airlines and more passengers.

When Members debated this issue on Tuesday, I welcomed the assurance the Minister gave to the House that the expert panel would meet the deferred pensioners before drawing up its report.  I then received correspondence from the deferred pensioners who stated they were concerned that while they had been given a meeting date, which was today, they had heard on RTE news that the report would be published tomorrow.  Obviously, this gave them some cause for alarm because they were wondering whether the report already had been pretty much written before they had had their meeting.  However, just before coming into the Chamber, I received a telephone call from one of the pensioner representatives who attended the meeting this morning with the expert panel.  The pensioner representatives were told quite clearly by the representatives of the expert panel that the report, which is to be published tomorrow, next week or whenever - the Minister might indicate to the House when precisely he expects this to be - will not refer to pensioners or deferred pensioners in any way because the terms of reference for the expert panel referred only to the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission recommendations.  Because the pensioners are not part of that process, the report will not refer to them, to their entitlements or to changes thereto and how they will be affected.<br \/>This is incredibly unfair.  Senator Darragh O'Brien and I have raised in the past the issue of the role of the pensioners and deferred pensioners as part of this process.  It is important that an agreement is reached that is fair to everyone.  However, for this to happen, every group must also have its voice heard as part of that process.  This is extremely unfair and I ask the Minister to ensure the report is not published until a way is found to make sure it will take into account and will reflect the concerns of the pensioners and the deferred pensioners.  If this requires the Minister to contact the expert panel to request it to take those concerns into account, I ask him to so do.  I welcomed the Minister's comments the other day when he stated the panel would meet the deferred pensioners and would take them into account.  However, it now appears as though that meeting merely was a cosmetic exercise because, straight away, they were thanked for coming but told the panel could not take into account their concerns and that they would not be referred to in the report.

We might also have required the port companies to include some of these measures of efficiency.<br \/>Part 7 of the Bill is titled &quot;Miscellaneous Amendments - Airports&quot;.  This is why we propose inserting the amendment into this Part.  The Minister has made interesting proposals on parking, clamping and the duties of directors.  He also acknowledged the need to ensure that airports are efficient performers in a world where airlines compete strongly.  We recognise there is a need for statistics.   He referred to the aviation strategy on which his Department is working.  Given that the data could have helped us to avoid the kind of Celtic tiger mistakes that were made in the airports and the legacy with which he is now wrestling, we should collect these statistics.  The amendment allows the Minister to cause to be published statistics on whether airports are price competitive with their international counterparts, whether they invest efficiently and whether their operating costs are efficient, as well as &quot;such other performance indicators as the Minister deems appropriate.&quot;<br \/>Since we commenced this debate, which I have found most useful, the Commission on Aviation Regulation reported on 29 May.  It has required a substantial reduction in the maximum charges levied at Dublin Airport.  One might argue there were inefficiencies that had to be wound out of the system.  I estimate there will be price cuts of slightly under 22% in the next five years because of the excess costs found in the airports.  Would these excess costs have been identified in advance if we had the data bank that we propose in the amendment?  The report states that only &euro;773 million of the &euro;925 million cost of the new terminal in Dublin would be allowed and that &euro;31 million in capital expenditure and just over half of the DAA's proposals were disallowed.  In another case &euro;183 million was disallowed.  The report suggested that the production of this infrastructure seems to have taken over as the object, with the result that goodies were offered to the airlines without telling them that it was going to cost much more to run the airport.  All of us would like marble halls.<br \/>The report identified a legacy staff problem in terminal 1 at Dublin Airport and that staff costs increased substantially between 2007 and 2009, while the rest of us were in a recession.  Information technology costs amounted to 5.8% of revenue, compared to the European average of 4.3%.  Operating costs were 25% higher than all airports according a sample study by Booz which was commissioned by the airport.<\/p> <p> The Minister, the Oireachtas and the public need to beware of people bearing airport terminals, high expenses and high operating costs because they damage the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  As we found in the Shannon case, with the precipitous drop in traffic - the Minister mentioned 61% - it damages tourism.  Where a market is dominated by one company, and this one is dominated somewhat less because the Minister has given Shannon its freedom, we still need to know here, at Cabinet and in the Minister's Department how efficient these airports are.  We also need to know whether their labour and capital productivity are up to the mark.<\/p><p>The Minister has recognised the data requirements for that.  I think the case is strengthened by the report on 29 May 2014 from the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  The data would be useful in decision-making but we will leave it to the Minister as to where he might like to publish them.  The need for more data was accepted by all sides on the last occasion.  The Central Statistics Office was also mentioned as a possible place to publish the data.<\/p><p>We will make better and more informed decisions if we are able to answer the kind of questions that are posed in various reviews of Irish airports as regards the tendency to over-invest and incur operating costs which are in excess of those elsewhere in a very competitive aviation market.  Having the data somewhere, either in the Department's annual report, in the aviation strategy, or through using the CSO or the Commission for Aviation Regulation, would enhance public decision-making in an area where it is needed.  One of the reasons for the Bill is to deal with certain legacy problems of excess expenditure and costs in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200024#X00900","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402580100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

If there is anything we can do on this side of the House when the Minister is having the discussions, we will be glad to help.  We do have a problem because, left to themselves, airport architects and engineers would gladly spend the entire GDP on building new airports.  We are attempting to put some kind of restraint on their activity by requiring the numbers.<\/p><p>For instance, the growth of Charleroi in Belgium to a 5 million passenger airport was because it was independent from the main Brussels airport.  It was able, one presumes, to assist the Belgian authorities by saying that it could do all those things without that many terminals or the high level of labour costs.  The information we are trying to get before policy-makers would have arisen in that kind of context.<\/p><p>There is unlikely to be a competing Dublin airport to restrain it from excesses, so there has to be an administrative solution involving the publication of numbers that the Minister mentioned.  I am glad he is open to that development.  We will assist him in that regard if we can be of any great use.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that we got into a serious problem of high cost airports and over-investment because we did not have those kind of numbers.  There was nobody to say we already had far too many runways or terminal buildings for an airport of that size and that our costs were too high.  That may be why airlines do not want to fly to a given airport.  It is not because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has not been promoting the destination enough, but one has to get into the marketplace and meet these airlines.<\/p><p>I will not push the amendment but I am glad it is in the Minister's thoughts to do something like that as aviation policy develops.

This provision is in line with other recent legislation relating to public sector reorganisations.  However, Forf&aacute;s staff and their representative bodies expressed concerns that the provision represented a dilution of terms and conditions under existing industrial development legislation, which provided for staff to transfer under existing terms and conditions, including but not confined to those relating to remuneration.  As such, staff representatives requested that the provisions enacted in respect of staff transferring to Irish Water under the Water Services Act 2013, which encompass that protection, be inserted in this Bill.<br \/>Following discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and trade union representatives, it was agreed to amend the language used in the Bill to provide for the transfer of staff under existing terms and conditions, including those relating to remuneration.  This agreement was subject to the putting in place of a protocol between the relevant bodies specifying the non-pay and non-pension terms and conditions of employment that apply in respect of Forf&aacute;s staff redeploying to other State organisations.  The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the terms and conditions identified are in line with existing public service norms and avoid the continuation of any atypical arrangements which would no longer be considered appropriate.  A draft protocol agreement has been agreed between the management and union representatives.<br \/>Accordingly, we are happy to broaden the language used in the Bill to provide for staff to transfer under existing terms and conditions, including those relating to remuneration.  The subsections requiring amendment are subsection 6(2), which relates to staff transferring to Enterprise Ireland; subsection 9(2), staff transferring to IDA Ireland; subsection 12(2), staff transferring to Science Foundation Ireland; subsection 14(2), staff transferring to the National Standards Authority of Ireland; subsection 24(2), staff transferring to the Department; and subsection 54A(3) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as inserted by section 31 of the Bill, dealing with staff transferring to the Health and Safety Authority.

I was appalled to learn that many similar contracts are being farmed out to overseas companies and multinationals at a time when we should be taking all opportunities to sustain and support Irish small businesses and jobs.  While the problem I am highlighting is particularly apparent in that instance, it applies to all other businesses.  This issue has been raised time and time again by Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and the Irish Booksellers Association.  I will refer to a case in point.  Large UK-based multinationals are undermining Irish publishers, which are small businesses, by virtue of being able to tender in a fashion that puts Irish businesses at a distinct disadvantage.  For example, they use wholesale discounting that cannot be matched in any sustainable way by Irish businesses in the short term.<\/p><p>The Small Firms Association, in conjunction with other stakeholders in the Irish small business sector, recently published alarming data which illustrate that 28% of Government contracts under procurement and tendering procedures are now being awarded to overseas companies.  That is the equivalent of business worth &euro;3.5 billion, which translates into the sustainability of 42,000 jobs.  I know the Government is putting all its energies into the Action Plan for Jobs and its job creation efforts.  I put it to the Minister of State that, in the first instance, the Government must at all times try to support and sustain existing jobs as a priority.  Once they are lost, it is hard to get them back.<\/p><p>There are some really harrowing personal stories behind what is happening in the whole procurement and tendering sector.  As we speak, people are losing their jobs because Irish firms cannot compete with the multinationals under the procurement and tendering criteria that are applied.  I know we cannot go back to the age of protectionism.  I know we must comply with EU regulations.  It was suggested to me that one never sees an Italian policeman driving a Peugeot or a French policeman driving down the street in a Fiat.  Ireland seems to be far more zealous and vigorous when it comes to embracing EU rules and regulations, to our own disadvantage and to the disadvantage of Irish businesses.  I appeal to the Minister of State to impress on the Government the need to examine why this is the case.  Why can we not adopt a far simpler system of procurement and tendering which is more compatible with the Irish small business sector and more conducive and strategic in terms of supporting Irish jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200029#DD00800","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1402582200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who cannot be here, unfortunately.  I understand this question arises in the context of a procurement process that is currently being undertaken by local authorities.  Activity being undertaken in that sector is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In addition, it would not be appropriate to comment on a live procurement process that is under way.  In December 2013, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government launched its libraries policy, Opportunities for All, which set out a shared procurement policy in relation to the procurement of library materials.  The current debate has been prompted by a competition being run by the Dublin local authorities for books.

The reform of procurement across the public service is a key element of the reform programme.  Public procurement savings enable public service organisations to deliver much-needed services from the tighter budgets within which they are now required to operate.  Reforms are being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The establishment of the Office of Government Procurement was a key part of the efforts to bring a more professional, whole-of-Government approach to procurement.  It is driving fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace, as well as providing better value.<\/p><p>Figures indicate that Irish businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, do well in winning Government business.  The Office of Government Procurement estimates that more than 95% of the Government's total expenditure of approximately &euro;31.1 billion on goods, services and works is spent within the State.  In addition, an analysis by the Office of Government Procurement indicates that 75% of the 2013 spend with Irish business was with small and medium-sized enterprises.  This represents an increase on 2012 levels.  We want small and medium-sized businesses to be successful in public procurement.  We also have to ensure there is fair, open and transparent competition.  Strong small and medium-sized enterprises that have won Government business here have gone on to win business in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The recent circular 10\/14 introduced business-friendly obligations on public procurers in areas like open tendering, breaking contracts into lots, lower financial qualification criteria, supporting consortia bids and requiring lower insurance, etc.  The circular sets out the guidelines to be followed by public procurers when performing market analysis to ensure businesses remain competitive in the long term.  We do not want to distort markets.  The Office of Government Procurement continues to work closely with industry bodies like the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation and Chambers Ireland to reduce barriers.  The Office of Government Procurement continues to support supplier engagement in education through its successful Meet the Buyer events and Go-2-Tender programmes, which are run in conjunction with InterTradeIreland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200029#DD00900","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1402582200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I refer to small family-run businesses.  That has to be taken into consideration.  While we have to get best value for the taxpayer when money is being spent, the lowest bid is not necessarily always the best bid.  All factors, such as the social and employment implications and the quality of service provision, should be taken into account.  These things must also be factored into the scheme.

As the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, is aware, negotiations have been ongoing between the Governments in Britain and Ireland to put together a memorandum of understanding on the export of electricity between the two countries, which would result in industrial size wind turbines being erected in large parts of County Meath.<\/p><p>Prior to the election, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, announced that the project would not go ahead.  Many residents in areas affected across the country were very happy with the news.  Exactly a week after the local elections, a notice of pre-planning consultation was lodged under the umbrella of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  The proposal related to 50 wind turbines in County Meath.  Recently, the company concerned issued a press statement to the effect that it is now involved in a different project to generate electricity for the domestic market and that the project is not dependent on the intergovernmental agreement.  It seems strange that the project could proceed so quickly with a planning application, which the company says is slightly different from what was previously intended, following a major Government announcement on the project.<\/p><p>I wish to clarify the Government&rsquo;s position.  Have there been any further developments on the intergovernmental agreement?  Was the Government given notice of the planning application?  The Government would have been in contact with the wind farm companies in recent years.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, addressed a number of conferences on wind energy.  What is happening from the Government&rsquo;s point of view?  Is the project authorised by the Government?  Is the Government encouraging it?  Does the Government know anything about the project in order that we can tell local residents what is going on?  Residents consider what is proposed to be a complete contradiction of what was said by the Government three to four weeks ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200030#EE00100","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1402582800,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I wish to respond on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who cannot attend.  The overarching objective of our energy policy is to ensure secure, sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy.  As a State, we have ambitious targets for 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 through meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% for transport and 12% for heat.<\/p><p>Underpinning the energy and economic policy objectives are five strategic goals, the first of which is progressively more renewable electricity from onshore and offshore wind power for the domestic and export markets.  In 2012, a total of 7.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy, equating to 19.6% of electricity demand.  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.  In 2012, a total of 15.3% of electricity demand was met by wind generation.  At the end of 2013, the total amount of wind generation connected to the grid was approximately 2,000 MW.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 MW and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.<\/p><p>Currently, more than 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers.  Therefore, private developers will be seeking planning consent for projects of varying scales to construct generation projects to meet our domestic needs.  The progression of each individual project is, in the first instance, a matter between the project developer and the relevant planning authority.  Given that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has no planning function in this matter, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has not received any report or communication concerning the planning specifics.  Consideration of the project is a matter for the planning system and, in particular, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>In any event, my Department is advised that the anticipated project referenced by the Senator is destined for supplying renewable energy to the domestic grid.  I accept that is what Senator Byrne said.  With regard to exporting renewable electricity generally, Ireland's renewable energy resources can deliver significantly greater volumes of energy than our domestic economy can absorb, presenting the opportunity to become a renewable energy exporter in the future.<\/p><p>On a number of occasions, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has stated with regret that it has not been possible at this time to conclude an agreement for renewable energy trading as envisaged under the memorandum of understanding he signed with the UK in January 2013.  Economic analysis conducted on the Irish side clearly indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading can deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, as well as being attractive to developers.  However, that will not happen automatically.  Renewable energy trading must be designed to work.  However, I believe that in the context of the European Internal Market and greater integration, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post-2020 scenario.  Any project seeking to export renewable energy would require the signing of an intergovernmental agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200030#EE00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1402582800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I will just give my views for the record.  I do not expect the Minister of State to respond directly.  The project seems to be going ahead in a very similar format to what was proposed before the intergovernmental negotiations broke down.  It seems to be the case that the Government hopes the intergovernmental negotiations will restart and that an agreement can be achieved.  It appears to me that the company is hedging its bets and applying for planning permission so that it will be ready to roll if and when an intergovernmental agreement to export energy is signed.<br \/>The situation has already created serious cynicism.  The application was made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la a week after the local elections.  I raised the matter on local radio on Tuesday.  No information was available from Element Power but a press release was published in the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>on Wednesday with details of the project.  The company should have been a lot more proactive about telling the public what was going on instead of waiting for a local politician to ask questions about the project on local radio.  We will keep an eye on what is happening.  The situation highlights one flaw in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, namely, that the pre-planning consultation process should be public.  The document and letters sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be available on a public file but that is not the case.

It was a cause of alarm to many that a new study has found a rise in neural tube defects in babies, mainly spina bifida, since 2009.  That is a worrying trend and should be considered in a policy review of the fortification of food with folic acid.  It is important to educate people, in particular pre-pregnant women, of the importance of folic acid in their diet.<\/p><p>Folic acid is a form of vitamin B but it cannot be made by the body and must be taken either in dietary form or as a supplement.  The dietary form of folic acid is preferable but supplements must be considered for those who do not get it their diet.  Foods rich in folic acid reduce the risk of having neural tube defects.  The incidence of neural tube defects is higher in Ireland than in any other European country.  The relative deficiency of folic acid in our diet contributes to the situation.  The information is from a new study but such facts have been known for years.  The recommended intake is 400 mg and sources include leafy green vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower.  For those who do not get folic acid through their diet, it is vital that they are aware they must take it in supplement form if necessary.<\/p><p>The new study by Professor Michael Turner from UCD&rsquo;s centre for human reproduction has found that there has been an increase in neural tube defects in this country.  There is clearly not enough awareness of the significance of folic acid in the diet of pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant.  At least one case a week of neural tube defect arises in newborns in Ireland and the trend must be reversed.  One must take into account the suffering for the families of children who are born with a neural tube defect.  Health economics must be taken into account as well as the suffering and social effects.  The burden of the disease that falls on the child, the family and also on the health system must be examined.<\/p><p>The study in question in UCD and the HSE Eurocrat Register concluded that the recession could have an impact on women's ability to get folic acid naturally in food such as fruits and vegetables, especially women from a lower socio-economic background.<\/p> <p>Education for young girls, pre-pregnant women and mothers is vital to ensure they receive sufficient folic acid, whether naturally through foods bought in shops or otherwise.  More than 50 countries, including the United States, have mandatory folic acid fortification in foods such as flour.  The Government reversed a decision on food fortification in 2008 owing to a falling rate of neural tube defects.  However, the rate is increasing again and stands at more than one case per week, which is too many.  A new study has revealed that the number of cases increased from 70 in 2009 to 87 in 2011, which is a significant increase, especially as the condition is preventable.  It is possible that these 87 children would have been born without neural tube defects if their mothers had taken folic acid either prior to pregnancy or in the early months of pregnancy.  The Government must not ignore this issue.  I ask the Minister to review current policy on adding folic acid to food and to initiate a public health campaign to promote pre-conception folic acid intake.  As I noted, 50 countries have a mandatory folic acid fortification policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200030#EE00700","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402583400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I thank Senator C&aacute;it Keane for raising this important issue.  By so doing, she will raise awareness of it, particularly among young women.<br \/>It is important that women take folic acid long before they consider conception.  General practitioners, who tend to be the first point of contact with the health system for young women in early pregnancy, will always advise taking folic acid.  In some respects, however, the horse will have bolted at that point.<br \/>The Department of Health is keenly aware of the association between folic acid intake and neural tube defects.  While such defects are not completely preventable, I accept the Senator's point that folic acid intake is an extremely important element in preventing neural tube defects and the pain, suffering and difficulty such defects cause to the individuals affected and their families.  I note also the costs that arise for the State.  This awareness is reflected in the health system's multifaceted approach to the issue, which includes educating women as to the benefits of folic acid in terms of reducing the chance of neural tube defects, promoting the use of folic acid supplements, and encouraging women to eat plenty of folate-rich food, such as spinach and watercress.<br \/>The paper to which the Senator refers, Neural tube defects in the Republic of Ireland in 2009-11, points to an increase in neural tube defects in Ireland from a rate of 0.92 per 1,000 to 1.17 per 1,000 between 2009 and 2011.  It notes a very low intake of folic acid supplements among women at the peri-conceptional stage and recommends a review of public health policy on folic acid fortification, folic acid supplementation and pre-conceptional care.<br \/>The issue of folic acid food fortification was considered by the Department of Health in 2006 and 2007.  A proposal to fortify bread with folic acid was examined in depth but was ultimately rejected following advice from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.  The FSAI's advice was based on the following facts.  First, in certain cases, excessive folic acid can act as a growth promoter of cancerous cells.  Second, in 2007, at the time as its analysis, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland considered that there was sufficient folic acid available in foodstuffs.  Finally, in 2007, the number of neural tube defects appeared to be in decline.<br \/>The Department of Health recognised the importance of ensuring a safe level of folic acid intake across all subgroups of the population.  For this reason, the Department decided not to proceed with the planned folic acid fortification of bread products in favour of pursuing a more targeted approach through awareness campaigns such as the Health Service Executive's promotion of folic acid intake in its health pregnancy pack, of which more than 80,000 copies are distributed annually.  Notwithstanding this, however, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has continued to monitor folic acid levels added to food and food supplements marketed in Ireland.  In this regard, I have been advised by the FSAI that it considers that we currently have adequate quantities of folic acid in the food supply through the voluntary addition of folic acid to various foods.<br \/>The issue of folic acid intake is much broader than simply food fortification.  The recent report claims that only 13.7% of the women surveyed took folic acid supplements during the pre-conceptional phase, while 49.2% did not take supplements at any stage.  This illustrates a possible lack of information and education among women on this subject.  It is clear the Senator's concern is to ensure we take a multifaceted approach to this issue and I accept it is one that we need to address.  Our endeavours in this area will be helped by the results of the current study by the Food Safety Promotion Board - <i>safe<\/i>food - on folate status and compliance with folic acid supplement recommendations among pregnant women.  The results of this study will help to inform our policy further and will assist us in adopting a more targeted approach.  We need to focus our efforts on those who need more folic acid, rather than exposing the whole population to the risk of excessive folic acid.<br \/>Prevention is always better than cure.  For this reason, I will ask the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to review this matter urgently when new studies are to hand and to make further recommendations.  I thank the Senator again for raising a critically important health issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061200031#FF00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1402583400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and look forward to further information on this issue when a second study has been published.
