The concrete block is the core component of the family home.  Senator Coffey visited Donegal in his time as Minister of State and examined this issue.  Essentially, family homes in Donegal are literally falling apart.  Families have to decide whether they continue to live in their homes and risk the roof falling down on top of them because of the impact on the gables of their homes.<\/p> <p>The Government set up an expert panel to look at this issue but its terms of reference are inadequate.  The Government has only asked the panel to look at the issue as it pertains to private homes.  I can confirm that Donegal County Council has examined hundreds of examples of its housing stock and has confirmed that very large numbers of houses are affected by this disaster for many families across the county.  The issue also apparently affects schools and other public buildings, yet the Government has only asked this panel to look at the matter as it pertains to private homes.  I am asking the Minister of State simply to amend the terms of reference to ensure this panel can investigate the matter as it pertains to private and public homes.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State also needs to clarify whether the panel can recommend a redress scheme similar to the pyrite redress scheme that was rightly put in place for devastated families in Dublin and north Leinster.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Families have had to make difficult choices.

I hope he will meet a delegation from Donegal County Council.  He should be aware that public representatives in the Minister of State's county took action on a similar matter when pyrite had an impact.  This affects hundreds or probably thousands of homes across Donegal.  It was caused by a profound failure in State regulation, as it was left to manufacturers to ensure that concrete blocks were built to a required standard.

This is a very important issue for the people of Mayo as well.

A representative group met officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in March 2014 and presented photographic evidence and the reports indicating beyond doubt that these houses were affected by pyrite.  I know families that have had to flee their homes because of pyrite, and that is not fair.  Hundreds of families in Mayo have had to stand by and watch households in the eastern part of the country be compensated.

In April this year, an expert panel on concrete blocks was established to investigate the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Donegal and Mayo.  In fairness to the Senators' colleague, Senator Paudie Coffey, that expert panel was set up quite quickly when compared with other panels in the past.  We must recognise the timeframe and it is important that it is up and running, doing its work.<\/p> <p>In May, the expert panel held meetings with the mica action group and elected members and officials from Donegal County Council to seek any information that may be available on the nature of the problems that have emerged in blockwork and affected homes.  The panel's report is due in October 2016 and I look forward to receiving it so we can see where to go from there.  I am aware the elected members of Donegal County Council welcomed the establishment of the expert panel during their meeting of 12 May and they have corresponded on the matter with me, requesting a meeting.  I am also aware that elected members expressed the view that the panel's terms of reference were too narrow and proposed that the terms of reference be amended to include buildings owned by public authorities.  However, unlike many private home owners, public authorities are generally better equipped and better resourced to investigate any problems that may have emerged with their buildings and to identify appropriate remedial solutions.<\/p> <p>In a specific case of local authority dwellings in Donegal that may be affected by defective blockwork, it would be a matter in the first instance for the council to deal with it.  As the owner of these properties and the organisation most familiar with their construction, it should investigate the nature of the problems, establish the number of dwellings affected and identify practical and cost-effective solutions that will address the problems.  Subsequently, it would be a matter for the council to present a detailed business case to my Department for consideration, should capital funding for remedial works be required on foot of those investigations.  This is in line with standard practice in such matters generally and in other areas as well.<\/p> <p>For the avoidance of any doubt, my Department will examine any proposals brought forward by Donegal County Council in this matter and will work closely with the council to resolve any problems identified in the concrete blockwork of the social housing stock to facilitate the delivery of cost-effective and timely solutions.  As was confirmed by the Taoiseach a few weeks ago on the floor of the D&aacute;il, I intend to visit a number of private home owners in north Donegal next week and at some stage to visit Mayo in the near future.  I can give that guarantee.  As part of the visit, I will meet elected members of Donegal County Council in order to listen to their concerns about these matters.  They were in touch with me via written correspondence in the past few days and I have written back with confirmation that we will meet.  I hope that will happen next week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately the terms of reference involve establishing the facts behind the problems in Donegal and Mayo, engaging in consultation and outlining technical solutions for addressing the problems identified in order to assist affected homeowners.  I have no proposals to amend the terms of reference of the expert panel, particularly given that it is already two months into its investigations.  In this regard, I will await the outcome of the panel's report before considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have arisen in the two counties.<\/p><p>To be very clear, the expert panel is moving quite quickly.  It did not waste any time after it was set up and a chair had been appointed before visiting Donegal and it will visit Mayo as well.

It took a lot of time, but those homes are being fixed and hopefully in the next 12 to 18 months all the homes affected will have been fixed.  It is a step-by-step procedure but first of all we must identify exactly what is behind all this.

Public officeholders include the President, members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the Judiciary, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and city and county councillors.  Payment of class K PRSI does not contribute towards the establishment of a social insurance entitlement - in short, a person gets no benefits from it.  Prior to the introduction of the class K contribution, all public officeholders were exempt from PRSI on their income as public officeholders.  Then, as now, they could establish and protect their social insurance entitlements based on their non-officeholder activities, or through the payment of voluntary contributions.  When the class K PRSI charge on the income of public officeholders was introduced in 2011, it was done on the basis that public officeholders had been identified as a group that were not paying PRSI on their income as officeholders.  The charge was therefore introduced as a measure of solidarity, allowing them to contribute to social insurance at a time when extensive curtailment of social insurance entitlements to other public and private sector employees was introduced.<\/p> <p>Since the introduction of the class K contribution for public officeholders, further measures to charge class K PRSI have been introduced.  Since 2013, class K PRSI at 4% is charged on the non-employment income of certain Civil Service and public sector workers who pay modified rates of PRSI, classed as B, C and D, where they also have income from a trade or profession.  Payment of class K PRSI by this group does not give cover for a range of benefits and pensions, such as the State pension, jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit.  In 2014, employees and pensioners under the age of 66 whose only other source of income is unearned became liable to pay class K PRSI at 4% on that unearned income where they are paying tax on that income.<\/p> <p>I am currently examining whether changes are required to the basis upon which class K is charged, particularly regarding the position of local authority members.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most councillors already have cover under the PRSI system through their other employment or activities.

Local authority members pay 4% PRSI and get no benefits in return for it, which is a uniquely unfair position, and that applies to other public officeholders also.  However, it is different for us in the sense that we have severance and pension arrangements but councillors do not.  Therefore, they are in a uniquely unfair position and one which needs to be dealt with.  I think all councillors know that but what they may not know or realise is that local authorities - which are not technically but which are effectively their employers - do not pay employer's PRSI.  If one were to change the situation and make them, for example, class A contributors like everyone else who works for the councils, the councils would then have to pay employer's PRSI and that would have an impact on the councils' budgets.  That needs to be borne in mind.  Another potential option is to treat them in the same way as those who are self-employed and move them to class S contributions.  A further option would be to raise the minimum threshold below which one does not have to pay anything.  In that way they would not have to pay anything, but they still would not get any benefits.<\/p> <p>There are a number of options and I will be meeting representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government in the coming weeks to discuss those options and to decide on the best option.

Whatever the case, we do should bring them in line with other workers or other self-employed people.

At that stage, it was expected that the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, would move to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus within ten years.

I do not believe this argument is about the health and well-being of up to 10,000 babies or their mothers, nor is it an argument about the quality of care.

The proposal to redevelop the National Maternity Hospital on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus has been under consideration for many years.<\/p> <p>Within a couple of days of my appointment as Minister for Health, I visited the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street.  One cannot leave the place without thinking it is an entirely inappropriate and substandard building.  It is not up to the standards we would want for expectant mothers and their infant children and indeed for front-line staff to work and deliver babies in.  It is utterly unacceptable.  It is quite disgraceful to think we went through the entire Celtic tiger period in this country without ever building the new national maternity hospital.<\/p> <p>In 2008, the KPMG independent review of maternity and gynaecology services in the greater Dublin area noted that Dublin's model of stand-alone maternity hospitals did not align with the considered norm internationally and acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  The report recommended that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus.  In 2013, the then Minister for Health, now Senator Reilly, with the agreement of both hospitals, formally announced the Government's intention to relocate the National Maternity Hospital to Elm Park and said that funding had been approved in the HSE's capital plan to allow the project to proceed.  Work on the design brief for the new maternity hospital has concluded.  I have seen a scaled model of the new hospital and can say that it represents a very exciting development for maternity services.<\/p> <p>The project is one example of the Government's commitment to maternity services.  That commitment was underlined by the launch of the country's first national maternity strategy earlier this year.  The programme for Government commits to implementing the strategy, and I look forward to leading the improvement of maternity services for women and their families over the lifetime of the strategy.<\/p> <p>The House will be aware, however, that difficulties have emerged about the future governance of the new National Maternity Hospital on the Elm Park campus.  Concerted efforts have been made to get the agreement of both hospitals to allow the project to proceed.  Meetings were held last year with both hospitals at departmental and ministerial levels, and a facilitated dialogue was undertaken earlier this year.  Unfortunately, that process did not achieve a solution.<\/p> <p>Since taking office, I have met both hospitals separately and jointly and stressed to them the need to resolve the outstanding issues as a matter of urgency.

It is now important that we step back and let Mr. Mulvey and the two hospitals work on a solution outside the media glare.  However, I want to assure the Senator and all other Senators that my overriding aim is to try to find a solution.  I must stress that both hospitals are voluntary independent hospitals and, therefore, I cannot simply impose a solution.  I intend to use my office to facilitate the finding of a solution.  An unedifying spat between two of our great medical institutions does not serve patients well.  It is important that the overriding objective of delivering property maternity services in appropriate accommodation for expectant mothers and their families is not lost in some bureaucratic row.  It is frustrating, given that the project is fully funded and a plan is ready to go.  We could lodge planning permission for the project within weeks if we find a solution.<\/p><p>Ultimately, both hospitals will have to reach an agreement on the outstanding governance issues.  The process cannot go on forever.  Agreement needs to be reached quickly.  The hospitals are working constructively with Mr. Mulvey and I hope and expect to see the outcome of that work in the coming days.  I remain hopeful that a solution can be found, and it is important that this happen as quickly as possible so this landmark project can proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#G00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I do not believe that at any stage the Government or the HSE would have spent &euro;5 million of taxpayers' money in preparing planning applications and doing the research that is needed to base the National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park.

I thank the graduates of Trinity College for giving me the mandate to be here today.  I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for his time.<\/p> <p>To give a bit of background, I spent the past 15 years developing addiction programmes on local drugs task forces.  I have been involved in drug research on drug trends and the changing nature of drug use.  I have also worked directly with those involved in low-level dealing.  I was alarmed to read in the media last week about proposed amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Acts that would further criminalise the drug user.  How we as legislators respond to the use and sale of drugs illustrates our values.  I, along with others, was elected to advocate for a progressive drug policy.  Criminalising drug users has been proven by international evidence-based research to have failed to address addiction and drug problems.  All over the world societies are recognising that addiction needs to be treated as a public health issue, not a criminal one.  If we look at the amendments in the light of recent developments on injection rooms, it is nonsensical; it is a case of one step forward and two steps back.  For example, the Minister has named zopiclone as a drug that would be targeted by the amendments.  Many of the people selling zopiclone are selling it to fund their own drug use.  People who are addicted to zopiclone, a widely used street benzo, would be at risk of resorting to other substances that would create further harms to the individual and the community.  The proposed change would also alter trends in drug use, which the services cannot keep up with in the absence of adequate resources.  Many who use street benzos cannot access treatment for benzo addiction.  Many people have suffered benzo fits from trying to detox themselves.  The Bill does not help the matter as it potentially forces the removal of such drugs from the market without matching that with treatment beds, which pushes the addict further into harm.  I expect that would not be the desired outcome for the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>I draw the Minister's attention to studies that clearly demonstrate the need to be progressive with drug policy, not regressive, which the amendments are mostly.  In the context of the UN General Assembly on the world drug problem, a Brookings Institution report outlined that \"socio-economic approaches for addressing drug-related crime and alternative livelihoods policies should be fully integrated into overall...economic development efforts\".  The report also stated: \"Mass incarceration of users and low-level, non-violent pushers does little to suppress - and can exacerbate - the use of illicit drugs. It may also increase drug market violence.\"<\/p> <p>Possession of street benzos and the legality of those puts extra strain on already under-resourced garda&iacute; and potentially costs the State due to unnecessary imprisonment of low-level dealers.  In another study, the International Drug Policy Consortium, an important point it made was that the level of harm is more important than the size of the market, and for me, the amendments are harmful.  To further criminalise individuals will further alienate them, prevent them from moving on and having prospects, especially with the current Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.  The success of the Portuguese model has been well documented and I urge the Minister to explore the evidence for a decriminalisation model that includes a person-centred approach to drugs and addiction.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to delay the introduction of the measures to allow for input from all involved stakeholders in order that policy is evidence based.  Will he commit in the future to evidence-based drug policy that has harm reduction at its foundation rather than contributing to the cycle of criminality?  How will the banned drugs be scheduled?  Could the Minister indicate whether the control of the substances will be extended to the medical and pharmaceutical industries, as the over-prescription of the drugs has been much more harmful than the illegal street dealing.  I understand that the Minister possibly feels compelled to respond to the incidents in the north inner city but I hope he will consider that the measures are regressive, potentially harmful to the users health, and ultimately will never affect those at the top of the drug trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#J00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane and congratulate her on her election to this House.  I take the point she made very seriously based on her experience but there are two issues involved and my contention is that they are somewhat separate in terms of what I am trying to do in this situation but also what the Government must do in terms of a national drugs strategy.<\/p> <p>I wish to start with a brief explanation of the existing misuse of drugs legislation, which has two primary purposes.  First, it aims to protect the public from dangerous and harmful substances which have no therapeutic or other legitimate use, for example, ecstasy or head shop drugs by establishing a system of tight control over those.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Second, the legislation facilitates the safe use of certain controlled drug substances which have a medical and therapeutic value but which are harmful if misused, such as benzos, heroin and cocaine.  The misuse of drugs legislation is an important element of the Government's arsenal in the fight against drug dealing and trafficking and consequent gangland crime.  There is currently a problem in parts of Dublin and elsewhere with the on-street sale of prescription medicine such as benzos.  To be clear, while it is already an offence under medicines regulations to supply or sell such products without prescription, the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are of the view that controlling these products under the misuse of drugs legislation will lead to more effective enforcement.  Following the recent murders in Dublin's north inner city, I instructed my Department to expedite the drafting of the misuse of drugs Bill, which was originally scheduled for the autumn of 2016.  I brought the Bill to the Government yesterday and received agreement to publish it.  To be clear, the Government resolved to give the Garda whatever tools it felt it needed to respond to the situation in the north inner city and this was one tool the Garda asked to be put in its toolkit.  This measure to address the issue was sought by the Garda and I am responding, as part of the whole-of-government approach, to what the Garda has asked the Government to do to address the ongoing worrying situation.<\/p><p>On-street drug dealers often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person, which can make it difficult for the authorities to proceed with the sale or supply charges.  Therefore, the Bill seeks to make possession of controlled medicines an offence to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disrupt the activities of dealers and to protect local communities.  If enacted, the Bill will provide for the drafting of regulations so that it will not be an offence for legitimate users, such as patients with a prescription and health care professionals, to be in possession of controlled drugs.  In addition to controlling a number of prescription drugs, the Bill will also control a number of substances which the European Union or the United Nations have identified as harmful and open to misuse.  These include substances in the NBOMe or N-bomb family of drugs that are implicated in the tragic incident in Cork earlier this year, in which one individual died and five others were hospitalised.  The Bill will also control clockwork orange, a psychoactive substance that is being abused in the Border counties and elsewhere.  This legislation is necessary and appropriate and is part of the suite of measures to assist in tackling crime and protecting public health.<\/p><p>Importantly, I intend to bring forward a second misuse of drugs Bill later this year, which will provide for the establishment of supervised injecting facilities for chronic drug users.  I reaffirm the Government's commitment to doing this, which is a commitment in the programme for Government.  I acknowledge the work done by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in his time as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy.<\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who is now Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, is currently developing a new drug strategy and in that context, I understand consideration is being given to the establishment of a group that would consider alternative approaches to dealing with simple possession offences.  There will be public consultation on the drugs strategy in the coming months and Senators and others will have an opportunity to contribute to this process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, would welcome an opportunity to benefit from Senator Ruane's own knowledge and expertise in this area.  In the meantime, however, I ask for the co-operation of Members in enacting this legislation as just a piece of the jigsaw the Government has been asked to put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I make the point clearly that this legislation is not my response or that of the Government and is not the new national drugs strategy.  That piece of work will be undertaken and there will be a second misuse of drugs Bill in the autumn of this year.  Moreover, a new national drugs strategy, which will be an action-based strategy to deal with the larger issues the Senator has legitimately raised, will be published this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#J00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I reiterate how the focus is on possession, which again mostly targets people who will be selling for their own use.

Many of the recent deaths have been due to a toxic mix of alcohol, other drugs and this substance.  It has not been proven to be due to this substance alone.

As a new Member of this House, I welcome the enthusiasm shared by all sides last Wednesday with regard to the reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

We all accept and recognise that carers play an integral role in our society, looking after loved ones and family members at a substantially reduced cost to the State.  Without them, our health service would collapse.  However, many face a serious financial burden because of substantial delays to their payments.  Fianna F&aacute;il learned last week that the average processing time for carer's benefit and carer's allowance is more than 18 weeks.  The appeals process could take a further 23 weeks.  This means a carer could be waiting more than nine months before receiving a payment.  This is unacceptable and is symptomatic of the unfairness perpetrated by Fine Gael in Government.  I ask that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, address the House and explain the delays and outline the actions he is taking to ensure that his Department fully supports and engages with the carer community.  These processing delays place additional stress on carers who are already under immense pressure as a result of their caring roles.  Efforts should be made to ease the burden, not exacerbate it.  As carers provide an invaluable service to the State, it is only fair that the Government shows them the respect they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#N00400","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The Opposition groups in order of size are Fianna F&aacute;il, Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in, Civil Engagement and the Labour Party.

I think you will be an excellent Cathaoirleach.<\/p><p>I refer to the situation in Orlando.  It is quite clear that this was a hate crime.  The people targeted were overwhelmingly gay latino men.  It seems that Mr. Mateen was a troubled person.  He had expressed violent views on gay people and was very negative indeed.  Apparently he was upset by the spectacle of two men kissing, as recorded by his wife.  Yet he was obsessed with Pulse.  He was there more than a dozen times and engaged in gay chat services.  It appears as if he may have had some trouble with his own sexual identity so that suggests that there is a great deal of work to do even in countries like America.  This is a terrible crime and highlights the situation regarding guns.  It is extraordinary that people can be put on a &quot;no fly&quot; list and yet they can still go in and buy heavy machines guns.  <\/p><p>We have a lot to do in this Seanad.  I suppose the most striking thing that is before us is Seanad reform.  I believe that virtually everybody in the House has views on this issue.  They strongly believe in the reform of the Seanad.  The Government claims to believe in the reform of the Seanad and it is by this yardstick that this Seanad will be judged.  We will be judged on whether we get substantial and real Seanad reform, not just some tricking around and loosening at the edges and so on.  It has to be comprehensive and full reform.  I look forward very much to the debate.  There is also the issue of the eighth amendment.  It is extraordinary that people in this country still feel that from their religious position they can intervene in a situation where a 13 year old girl has been raped and direct her as to what decision she should take. The same applies with regard to fatal foetal abnormality.  It is an obscenity that the mother of an unfortunate child who has no brain, no nervous system and so on should be forced, whether against her will, to keep the child.<\/p><p>We must look also at the question of direct provision on which I have legislation that I hope to present to the House.  It nearly passed the last time.  The President has called for the Oireachtas to get involved in this issue.  We nearly did it the last time and I believe we can do it again in this Seanad.  There is also the living city initiative which was introduced partly as a result of pressure from this House to rescue the inner city core of buildings.  This has been completely unacceptable.  Only 33 applications were made nationally.  This is because it was hedged around, festooned, as <i>The Irish Times<\/i>editorial stated this morning, with all kinds of inhibitions preventing people taking it up.  In particular, speaking as somebody who is interested in the preservation of the Georgian core of Dublin, I was horrified at the restriction of 210 sq. m.  As a civil servant said at the time, this was specifically to exclude what is described as Georgian mansions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These buildings are a feature of our city; they are the identifying mark.

It was a very sad occasion and sad to see such a solemn and concerned atmosphere among those attending.  We extend our concern and solidarity to those in Orlando, but it is also imperative that we send a message about the importance of a considered response grounded in respect and peace and on a concern for diversity and a recognition of diversity.

I commend GLEN, BeLonGTo and Transgender Equality Network Ireland on organising the vigil on Monday evening and the Lord Mayor of Dublin on opening the book of condolences in the Mansion House.

We would like to see further progress on this Bill, which was a Private Members' Bill accepted on Second Stage by the Government in January 2016.  I hope we will see this proceed through the House as a Private Members' Bill.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on the ruling last week of the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the application brought by Amanda Mellet.  I commend her on her bravery and that of her family and those involved in Termination for Medical Reasons because the ruling of the committee has shone a light on the need to address the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  The finding that Ireland was in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and had violated the human rights of Ms Mellet because of the prohibition in our law of termination, even in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, deserves a very prompt and urgent response from the Government.  I am disappointed to hear the Taoiseach appear to dismiss or denigrate that ruling as not being binding.  I am concerned for two reasons about his proposal to put forward a citizens' assembly.  First, it appears to be an attempt to delay taking any action on the need to abolish the eighth amendment.  The Taoiseach did not need to put the issue of Seanad abolition to a citizens' assembly before he called the referendum on that and I do not believe we need a citizens' assembly before we have a referendum on repeal of the eighth amendment.  Second, some commentary about the citizens' assembly from Fine Gael politicians has betrayed an anti-politician tenor that is disturbing, that this idea is somehow going to be better than the Convention on the Constitution, a model which I think all of us in the previous Seanad agreed was a very worthwhile model that paved the way for the marriage equality referendum.  That Constitutional Convention was made up of representatives of political parties and citizens chosen in accordance with the demographics of the country.  This sort of model would be preferable to a citizens' assembly.  If a citizens' assembly is to be held, it needs to be done expeditiously and we do not want to see any further delay.  We do not want to see any more cases like that of Savita Halappanavar or the tragic case in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.  We need to move towards repeal of the eighth amendment without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#Q00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the ruling out of order of the issue I raised under Commencement Matters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure the terms of reference for the new tender process for the issuing of driver licences would require that all post offices would act as agents, enabling the public to obtain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#Q00300","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.

Members may be aware that such policies involve an applicant taking out a life cover policy for events after his or her death and it would protect the family financially.  It is good and useful for most people to undertake such a policy.  However, people do not seem to realise that after ten years paying into such a policy, an anniversary is reached whereby an insurance company may, and invariably will, increase the premia significantly with no corresponding increase in the guaranteed sum.  I can give a brief example.  Ten years ago, an individual took out a whole-of-life assurance policy, with the premium set at &euro;90 per month and the assured sum at &euro;100,000.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ten years later, the sum insured has grown to approximately &euro;220,000, a 100% increase, but the premium has gone from &euro;90 up to &euro;800 per month.

One finds people who are coming into middle and old age and who can no longer afford to maintain the premiums on their life cover at a time when, actuarially speaking, they probably have more need of it than ever before.  This matter was raised in the previous D&aacute;il by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has identified a very significant cohort of people who are caught in the trap to which I refer.  It is a trap, because in many cases individuals have used life cover as security for their mortgages and they cannot arbitrarily opt out because then they do not have mortgage protection, which is more difficult to obtain the older one gets.

I understand completely that due to the delay in the formation of a Government and the fact the Government is in a minority in the Lower House, there will be a dearth of Government legislative proposals for some time and the volume of Government legislation will be less than has been the case for a long period.  I urge the House to make good use of the time available to it to deal with proposals which do not necessarily come from the Government but which are, particularly in the case to which I am referring, in accordance with the programme for Government.  We should not just shoehorn everything that is not proposed by the Leader into Private Members' business.  Rather, we should order the House's business so as to accommodate what the House in terms of the issues with which it wants to deal.  It is in that context that I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that No. 11 be taken before No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#S00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#S00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach b&aacute;ire moladh a thabhairt do na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair a bhfuil c&uacute;pla focal acu na focail sin a &uacute;s&aacute;id.

I am not sure how it pulled that one off, but certainly we in Connemara and in Galway will not take it sitting down.  It illustrates how this bin tax which is being imposed on people is totally unacceptable.  It comes from the privatisation of the refuse collection system which was ill-thought out and which, in our opinion, should not have been put forward.  It needs to be reviewed.  We need the Minister for rubbish - I am not certain whether it is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who is dealing with the matter or if it is has been passed over to the new Minister - to discuss this immediately.  The measure is to start in July and it is ill-thought out.  There are families who cannot afford to pay their water charges, the property tax and so forth, and they see this as another tax being piled upon them with very little choice and very little consultation.  There are questions around where the money is going, where the data are being collected and how they are being used.  I urge the Leader to have that debate next week, if possible.

From talking to councillors right around the country we know that critical infrastructure is short in many places.  We know many bad planning decisions were made where no critical infrastructure was provided on land that was zoned by people of all parties and none across local government.  We also know the Planning and Development Act clearly provides for sections 48 and 49 levy schemes for planning permissions to provide for contributions by developers to development, and ultimately they would be ring-fenced for critical infrastructure to aid, assist and bring about those developments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I refer, in particular, to housing.

I note that in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, there has been a correction regarding these announcements yesterday in the media and that this funding will not come until the back end of 2017.  I ask the Leader for clarification in this regard because, throughout the country, approvals for planning permission are withering on the vine because developers cannot get projects off the ground as a result of the lack of infrastructure and bad planning in preparing for that infrastructure.  More importantly, in some cases it is not viable and I was informed the other day of a cost of &euro;45,000 in respect of critical infrastructure before one even gets going.  As that will not happen, Members must face up to the reality.  A continuous supply of affordable and social housing is needed and I look forward to partaking in the debate on homelessness later because this also is part of this subject.

There is, of course, another Union to stay out of which I would love to have a vote but hopefully down the line, as allowed for in the Good Friday Agreement, perhaps the Seanad can fulfil the ideals of 1916 as outlined and work towards that Border poll and democratically give everyone the right to assert national independence.<\/p> <p>Ar an drochuair, is in &iacute;sle br&iacute; go gcaithfidh m&eacute; i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire trag&oacute;id a tharla sa Fhrainc i rith na seachtaine le linn com&oacute;rtas sacair Euro 2016, at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l sa t&iacute;r sin faoi l&aacute;thair, a ard&uacute; sa Teach inniu.

I hope the Chair will indulge me as I intend to ask the Leader to do something unique and I will be brief.  I refer to the fans that has travelled and which has represented both teams, and us overall, exceptionally well in their behaviour and conduct and in the revelry in which they have been engaged.  However, Members also will be aware that at present, the family of Lee McLaughlin in County Donegal has issued an appeal for people to keep an eye out for him.  He is missing and his family is unaware of his whereabouts.  We have a duty of care to our people who travel overseas, in particular for major international soccer or rugby tournaments to which such vast numbers of citizens travel.  Perhaps the Ministers with responsibility for sport both North and South, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, OFMDFM, can consider a concerted campaign on how to promote welfare and looking after one another and how to engage with people back home.

In the same way as for any group in society that is being attacked or is not getting fairness, it is an attack on a whole society.<\/p><p>Carers' week has been mentioned already.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to participate in its launch on Monday morning.  I will bring two insights to this.  First, the great majority of carers in this country, up to 80%, are female.  I would put this thought to us all here: what more practical way to support, liberate and encourage the full participation of women in society than to take the yoke of 24-7 caring from them as best we can?  The other point I would make about caring is that one does not just become a carer and cease being a lover or relative - son, brother, father, mother or whatever.  It is something that comes with living but it should not be something that absolutely consumes the person involved.<\/p><p>My being here is a function of getting support from everybody from right across the political spectrum, not only the Members of both Houses here but particularly the local authority members.  I was extremely struck - it was an eye-opener to me and it is a reflection on some of the points already made this morning - by the fantastic and often unsung work that members of local authorities are doing, and the commitment and heart that they bring to it.<\/p><p>Every entity in the Oireachtas is in support of the ratification and implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is to be ratified by the end of this year.  My request to this House and, indeed, the Leader is to ensure that we can bring that flavour of inclusiveness for persons with disabilities, their families and carers into our every debate and consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#Y00300","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his elevation and congratulate the Leader, both of whom will do a fine job.<\/p> <p>I want to highlight an issue that I highlighted several times in the previous Seanad - that is, the area of childhood obesity.  In particular, I highlight a report by the Irish Heart Foundation which has found that junk food companies or food companies which are selling particular junk food products are purposely targeting young Irish teenagers on social media sites such as Facebook.  I suppose these companies are trying to get them as young as they can but, as young as they are on there, they are being targeted.  The report revealed that the sophisticated techniques used to target children online through Facebook include tagging and comments.  They do it in a humorous way and sometimes make reference to sports stars and festivals.  It is subliminal and sophisticated.  According to a child psychiatrist - this morning I was researching this a little - these companies are using high-tech analytics to target children directly so that they can monitor them.  Perhaps Senators have seen on social media that if one shows an interest in a certain matter, suddenly one finds one has many other things to do with that on one's feed.  This is dangerous.  We have legislation in place to restrict this type of advertising, which is targeted at children in specific ways, and social media should not be any different.  According to the research, 75% of parents were extremely unhappy when they discovered that this was happening.  They had not a clue that this type of marketing was getting at their children.  We have a serious issue with childhood obesity in this country, with one child in four either overweight or obese - I must have stated that statistic 150 times in the Seanad.  We have not done enough to date.  The Government now has a Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, and I do not want that to be symbolic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want us to take this issue seriously as the situation is grave.

It is so hard to learn, when one reads the figures and is fighting for people to get carers, that there is a backlog of 11 months for appeals for carers to be provided.  We live in a society where people are living longer and we encourage people to stay in their homes, which is part of the new Government, and yet we must fight for 11 months to get appeals for carers to be provided to the elderly and other people.  Such a situation is not good enough.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to call on the Minister to address this matter because it needs to be urgently addressed.

There is a massive crisis in child care, at the root of which is funding.  As an illustration of how bad the funding situation is, as a percentage of GDP, we spend 0.2% on child care.  We are not just at the bottom of the European league; we are at the bottom by a million miles.  The next worst is the UK, which spends four times as much.  It is clear we are in trouble when the Tory Government spends four times as much as our Government on child care.  Three cr&egrave;ches have closed in Limerick in the past week.  In one case, at Tic Toc cr&egrave;che in Westbury, the workers had to sit in to get their rights with regard to redundancy payment.  At the heart of the crisis is funding.  The typical pay for a child care worker is &euro;9.80 per hour.  That is how little we value child care here, despite all the rhetoric, and is an indictment of the last Government and previous Governments for the past ten or 20 years.  That it was not addressed during the Celtic tiger period is an absolute disgrace.  Child care workers at the front line are voting with their feet.  People who are qualified with doctoral and master's degrees are leaving to take up child care posts in America, Britain and other countries where they are paid properly.  We need a debate on this issue.  We need to address the crisis.  I am proud to be a member of SIPTU, which is working hard to address this with its Big Start campaign.  SIPTU deserves support and recognition from the Department.  The workers who are at the front line need to be at the heart of the solution to our child care crisis.

We are losing our young people not only to drug problems and gambling but also to alcohol misuse.  I wish to highlight the devastating impact of alcohol misuse, drug misuse and gambling on families.  I have worked with such families for many years and have witnessed the devastation caused.  Family members can have mental health issues including depression, anxiety, stress and worry.  There is not a family in the country that does not have somebody in their lives who may have an alcohol misuse problem.  I am not talking about the final stages of addiction but rather alcohol misuse.  We have a huge binge drinking culture which is scary.  It is connected to many issues, such as road deaths and suicide.  Alcohol is a depressant and causes depression.  After people binge drink at the weekend, the devastation and the depression they experience during the week is beyond the beyond.

In 2015, there were 3.5 million outpatient attendances, which is 60,000 per week or 12,000 per day.  That includes services such as day case procedures and outpatient departments.  It shows the dedication and commitment of the nurses, staff and all the people who are working in the HSE.  I compliment them on the valuable service they provide.  The figures of 12,000 people per day and 60,000 per week attending as outpatients are sometimes not mentioned.  My colleague in Sinn F&eacute;in raised the issue of bed closures.  The health service has moved from a situation where many procedures required admission to hospital to one where many of them are now day procedures.<\/p><p>There is also the issue of general practitioners.  Many GPs seek to deal with certain areas of health care which were traditionally referred to a hospital.  It is extremely important that the contract negotiations between GPs and the Department of Health are progressed and concluded.  There is no point in returning, three or four years hence, to negotiations that should have been concluded.  It is time for the Department to move on this matter.  It is also time for it to include all the representative bodies for GPs in those negotiations, which means not only the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, but also the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP.  These negotiations are important so I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline what progress has been made on the matter over the past 12 months and whether there is a timeline for making progress to bring it to a conclusion.  GPs can then provide additional services and be adequately remunerated for them.  It will also encourage more people to come home to this country to work in the service.  The more GPs working in the service, the fewer referrals there will be to hospitals.  That is extremely important for trying to progress and provide a comprehensive health service.

As somebody who is very involved in that industry, I welcome this.  Unfortunately, however, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, made a submission stating that the council was contravening the existing wind energy guidelines.  The current guidelines are outdated and archaic with regard to the modern wind turbines that are proposed.<\/p> <p>I am not opposed to wind energy, but the equine industry is a major industry in this country.  While we all probably have an eye on the soccer this week, Royal Ascot is also taking place and every newspaper one opens carries plaudits from people all over the world for our horse breeding industry and the performance of the Irish thoroughbred.  Thoroughbreds are extremely sensitive to wind turbines.  Due to the large equine industry in Westmeath and also with an eye to the national industry, Westmeath County Council introduced the variation I mentioned, but it has been ruled out of order.  When one tries to inquire about the proposed new wind energy guidelines, not only does nobody know what shelf they are on but also nobody appears to know which Minister is responsible for them.  Today, it could be an energy matter but on another day it could be a planning issue.

Perhaps we can then have a debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#DD00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>On this first full sitting day I wish the Cathaoirleach well for his term.  I also wish the Leader and the other Members who have been elected leaders and Whips well.<\/p> <p>I will start today as I mean to go on, as I did in the previous Seanad.  A total of 43 Members of this House have been elected by councillors and it is important that we look after the welfare of those councillors.  I listened to some of the contributions in which the issue of mental health and well-being was raised.  There was a tragic incident during the Seanad election campaign in which a councillor took his own life.  During that campaign I met scores of councillors suffering from stress and anxiety.  They are unable to handle the case work they have been given, they do not know where or whom they should guide people to, and they have nobody to whom they can turn to look after their mental well-being.  I have checked this matter out with various local authorities.  There are welfare officers in each local authority in the country but, believe it or not, they are not available to councillors.  This must be addressed, and I hope it will be done quickly during this term.  It requires a little common sense and the intervention of the Minister.  It probably requires a special service to be put in place.<\/p> <p>I sat in the kitchen of a councillor's home for two hours - I will not say where in the country it is located - during which time he explained the cases he was dealing with.  They included people who are facing bankruptcy, people who are being put out of their homes and people who had marriage difficulties.  He asked me how he was equipped to deal with these issues.  He said he was not, and that he was not even equipped to listen properly.  Gone are the days when a county councillor attended a meeting once or twice a month and dealt with a few housing issues and perhaps some medical card issues.  The workload of councillors has increased dramatically as a result of what has happened in this country.  I commend my colleagues, Senators Craughwell and Boyhan, on tabling the motion, and I will propose an amendment to it relating to terms and conditions.<\/p> <p>This is about well-being.  This week is men's health week, and this issue has been shoved under the carpet.  Nobody wants to talk about it, and some people are embarrassed about it.  We normally take action after an event has happened.  In this case, unfortunately, the event has happened.  Obviously, I will not say where, as we all know what happened.  It is the result of what I have just mentioned.  On the first day the Minister comes to the House to discuss local government, he should address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#DD00300","speaker":"1387"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I join the speakers who expressed sympathy following the horror and human tragedy in Orlando.<\/p> <p>The specific issue I wish to raise is Mr. Justice O'Higgins's report.  The report, which is excellent, has generated an enormous amount of coverage on all national media, including social media.  That is reasonable given that it is a huge and important report.  One element, however, that received no coverage is very important for Garda morale, well-being and, indeed, for the provision of a Garda service.  The Garda station is identified by Mr. Justice O'Higgins as being an old RIC station from 1870, to which a flat roofed area was added around 1970.  The judge uses terms in the report such as \"not fit for purpose\", \"deplorable conditions\" and \"not sound\" to provide Garda services.  He says that while it is not the only reason there were problems, it was a huge contributing factor.  It is a relevant issue for the Leader to address.  Perhaps he would get a response from the relevant Ministers on what will be done about accommodation for the Bailieborough garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p>In the previous Oireachtas I lobbied the relevant Ministers - the former Deputy Shatter, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Harris - intensely.  I am aware that a site has been acquired for a new Garda station and that the legal procedures on that are ongoing at present.

I will hand it to the Leader later on.  The situation is chronic and immediate action is required.  I need to know that there is a commitment that the legalities regarding acquiring the site, which I gather is imminent, are have been concluded and that there is a timeframe for building the station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#DD00400","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and wish him the best in his new post.

I think Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke about how this Chamber is very diverse in terms of Members' array of talents.  Seanad reform is key but the items the House deals with are more fundamental than that.  This week is national carers' week.  Senator Kelleher spoke about people being cared for in their homes.  We need to look at the fair deal scheme and see how it can be adapted in terms of a home setting.  Putting someone into a nursing home is the last resort for most people, regardless of whether they have a disabled spouse, disabled children or elderly parents.  It should be the last resort.  We need to look at proper day-care services.<\/p> <p>Could the Leader ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the House?  Ireland is recovering but, in the area of public procurement, I have come across a number of small family-owned businesses which had public contracts for the past 20 years but which have been unable to tender for those contracts because they do not meet the size requirements for public tendering.  We need to consider this issue so I ask that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come before the House to ensure that if a family business is doing a good job, it will not be at a disadvantage because of its size.<\/p> <p>I agree with all the sentiments about the tragedy in Orlando.  I compliment Senator Lawless because he brings a perspective on guns and the holding of guns in the US.  I hope that this will be a watershed, that common sense will prevail in the US and that we can learn from what happens outside this country, which has had issues with gun crime.  We should learn from it and look at the legislation.<\/p> <p>The role of this House is to question legislation and decisions that are being made and for Members to operate collectively as a group.  This Seanad has an opportunity to do things in a slightly different way.  I look forward to this Seanad being a debating Chamber.  I take Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell's point.  I was not aware that someone could order shoes on the Internet but her basic point is a relevant one - that this is a debating Chamber and that we should have robust debate.  We do not have to agree on everything but it is important that everything is discussed to its proper degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#EE00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leader and wish them well in their roles.  I congratulate all the Senators on being elected to the House.  I am very honoured and privileged to be elected here and to be among the fine body of people I see in front of me in this room.<\/p> <p>I compliment all the Senators on their contributions.  I particularly compliment Senator Black whose contribution came very much from the heart and was related to her personal experience and journey.  If we are honest, every family in this country could tell a similar story.  It is an issue that we need to explore in more depth.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to see how we can look at online gambling and what constraints we can introduce because it is a serious problem that is getting worse, among many others.<\/p> <p>Harking back to my past, many Senators mentioned the role of country councillors.  I was elected as a town councillor in 1999 and a county councillor in 2004.  I would like to think that I speak with some authority on the issue.  The abolition of town councils was a serious mistake.  It has done nothing for towns in rural Ireland and must be addressed.  The workload has increased.  Based on my experience - and I do not say this lightly - that workload is unbelievable.  It has reached the stage that very few people will be able to enter politics because the role of a county councillor is a full-time job if it is done properly.  This issue, including terms and conditions, must be addressed at a time when we are trying to get more people, including more women, involved in politics.  By removing the town councils, we have taken away the first tier of local government and the first step on the ladder relating thereto.  This is a mistake and the relevant Minister should come to the House to address all of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#EE00400","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank all 39 Senators who spoke this morning and this afternoon.  In response to Senator Wilson, Private Members' business involves ten minutes for the proposer and six minutes for the seconder.

Today, like many Senators, my \"L\" plates are on and t&aacute; m&eacute; an-neirbh&iacute;seach.<\/p> <p>I thank all 20 Senators who spoke about Orlando.  As a member of the LGBT community, to wake up on Sunday morning to television and news coverage of the depraved killing of 49 people left one numb.  I say this as somebody who sees - and uses - our nightclubs and gay pubs and community venues as havens and refuges where men and women of all ages can feel safe and secure without the fear of being attacked verbally or physically, let alone being gunned down and where those within that community have a sense of belonging and acceptance.  I join all other Senators in sending our sympathies to the families, partners, husbands and wives of those who have been killed and I ask the Cathaoirleach to send our deep condolences to the US ambassador.  This is an act that took place during the month of pride and to those who ask why Gay Pride continues, the events in Orlando and across the world where people kill others in the name of religion show why we need Gay Pride.  It comes 12 months after a referendum in this country where we stood as a beacon across the world.  This week, across our country in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and other cities, people are organising a vigil through GLEN, LINC or the Gay Men's Health Service.  It is an example of why we must continue our work and ensure that no person who was born this way is afraid to come out and live the life they can.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know it is not a day for political statements but I agree with Senator Lawless that the issue of gun control and the right to bear arms in the United States of America is one that we must collectively try to change.  I hope that through his good offices the Senator will be able to help bring about that change, irrespective of a political ideology.  For any person under any kind of surveillance to walk into a gun shop, buy two types of weapons and, a couple of days later, do what he did begs a serious question.  It is a lesson we must all consider.<\/p><p>I hope, with the Orlando events, we can send a message to our sons, daughters and friends that it is okay to be gay and come out to live a normal life.  If we do not do it, we will go back to the days when we were suppressed.  I appeal to those of other religions not to see this as western values versus those of the Far East, or wherever.  Those of us who are gay are men and women of value, principle, and integrity.  We must all work to ensure that our society and world are better and kinder places.<\/p><p>Seven Members raised the issue of carers' week and I was fortunate last Monday morning to be with Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in University College Cork where she gave a fine speech on carers and the launch of a new study done by people at the university.  It is important that we collaborate to ensure the national carers' strategy is implemented.  There are parts that can be put in place without cost and it is important that we in this House, along with Deputies, set up a cross-party group, as we did with mental health.  We should not just pay lip service and we must ensure that the carers' strategy can be put on a footing whereby there can be implementable action points.  I look forward to working with Members on that.<\/p><p>I am happy to accept Senator McDowell's proposal on Seanad reform on behalf of the Government.  To the eight Members who spoke on it, I say that we on this side of the House will not stand in the way of reform.  It is important that if we are serious about reform, the legacy we should leave in this Twenty-fifth Seanad should be of reform to bring about change.  We may have different views on how to get the end result but as part of the process, it is important we begin a discussion on how we can implement the Manning report, which is central to the programme for Government.  I have already spoken to the Taoiseach about this and he will make known his views on this in a couple of weeks.  It is incumbent on us, in a cross-party manner, to bring about reform of the Seanad encompassing all views.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised questions on the Order of Business and it is important for us to consider waiting times.  The Minister for Health will be in the House next week to discuss issues of health.  Senator Norris, in a very fine address, and Senator Bacik raised the issue of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  The Taoiseach has proposed a citizens' assembly.  I share Senator Bacik's view and it is important we have Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas as part of that citizens' assembly.  I say that as somebody who served on the Constitutional Convention, which brought about profound change in our country.  Those who decried the Constitutional Convention should read some of the scholarly articles by Professor David Farrell and others, as in our case that convention was mould-breaking.  It allowed citizens and elected public representatives to come together to discuss matters of sensitivity and political policy and reform.  A citizens' assembly is the way to go with the eighth amendment.  For those who propose abolition there is a hiatus and for those who want retention, the answer is not kept for those who want to get rid of the eighth amendment.  It is important that we take the issue away from the body politic and the heat of the political process.  As a former chairman of the health committee that dealt with the protection of health during pregnancy legislation, I see it as important that we handle this in a sensitive and careful manner.  It is about the lives of people and different views.  It is important that we hear all sides and not just extremes, whatever our own views or ideology.<\/p><p>Senators Norris and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, a former Minister of State, raised the direct provision issue.  I commend the former Minister of State, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, on the work he did on direct provision.  I spoke to the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, already about this as, despite Senator Craughwell's view about politics and constituencies, this transcends such constituencies.  In my own city of Cork we have a number of centres-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#EE00500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>It is a national problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FF00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>It is important we hear the views of people who have rights and entitlements, who deserve our respect; we have a duty of care to them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is visiting direct provision centres and I hope he will, in time, come to the House to discuss the issue.<\/p> <p>I fully agree with Senator Norris about the Living City initiative.  In a number of budgets, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, brought up the scheme for living over shops, if one likes to use such a term.  It is an issue that should be considered by the Government so that we can not just preserve the buildings mentioned but attract people to our inner cities in areas like Cork and Waterford.  When Senator Coffey was a Minister of State, he worked very closely with the Department, councils and the construction sector to ensure we have people moving to cities.  In my city of Cork, there is much space over shops and businesses where there could be apartment dwellings, as there are in parts of Europe.  I hope we can have a debate about that as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about health and waiting times.  I am pleased to point out that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are working on a dedicated waiting time initiative.  The Minister for Health will be in the House next week to discuss the matter and we can take the issue further.  With respect to Moore Street, I will ask the Minister responsible, Deputy Humphreys, to come before the House for a debate.  I have not got the exact answer right now but I will revert to the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the issue of getting ready for full employment.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be in the House tomorrow and we can debate the issue.  I hope we can have a series of discussions about employment.  If Members are on the list to speak when we reach the end of the allocated time, I will be happy as Leader to ensure the debate rolls over.  It is a very important issue.  In the course of the last D&aacute;il we saw unemployment fall from 15.9% to 8%, which is a tremendous record, given the economic decline we experienced.  It is an issue we need to address and we, as Senators, have a role to play in that.  The report on domestic violence is shocking and significant action must be taken on the issue.  The question of the Istanbul Convention should be examined and I will certainly take that up with the Minister on behalf of Members in this House.  This morning's report was very upsetting.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of gun control, which I have already addressed, domestic violence and the eighth amendment.  I hope we will see movement on that with the citizens' assembly.  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of flood defences and it is very important, particularly the minor works schemes.  I agree that the Office of Public Works and the local councils should prioritise flood defence mechanisms.  There has been work done, to be fair to the previous Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and he worked with councils in many parts of the country in developing policy and the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management.  Senator Lawless spoke very convincingly about gun control and the events in Orlando.  I welcome him to the House.  His is an important voice not just for the diaspora but for Irish-Americans in general, as he will play a key role in articulating our views.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as we have all benefited from friends in America giving us jobs.  I spent my J1 summer there when my cousin got me a job; I would not have got it without him.  Every summer we get requests from many people looking for jobs in America.  Some of the commentary is unfair to the Senator in that regard.  He will bring an important dimension to the House and I look forward to working with him in building a cross-party approach to the illegal immigrants and Irish America.  It is important that we continue the link with America, as it is close to all of us.  Many of us have family and friends living there; although there has been change I know people who left Ireland because they were gay and they are living open and happy lives in America.  <\/p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of marketing of life insurance policies and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this important issue.  The Senator indicated that it is important that these companies have a duty of care to people who buy the products.  Sometimes the small print is not read or pointed out.  I agree with Senator McDowell's comments on Seanad reform.  The Government will not challenge the amendment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important in regard to Seanad reform that we take our time and get it right rather than rushing to be the first to have Seanad reform done.  It is important, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said earlier, that we speak as one voice and work together.  It is important that we cast aside our political differences on issues because new politics is not about opposition the whole time, but working together.  As Leader of the Seanad, I hope we will have a business committee at which we can run the business of the House.  I met with some of the leaders yesterday and will be meeting with the leaders and the Whips together again so that we can order the business of the House in a collaborative way.  On a personal level, it does not serve us well in this House that we have divisions every day on the Order of Business on the premise of bringing a Minister in to discuss A, B or C.  If we can operate in a mature manner, working together to ensure we run the business of the House properly and in a manner that ensures Members get a fair say and have their voices heard, that serves us better not just here, but also in the eyes of the public.<br\/><br\/>Bh&iacute; an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh ag caint mar gheall ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge.

I will ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come before the House to speak on that matter. <br\/><br\/>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of carers.  I agree with her regarding having an all-party committee.  I have said that we should work together on that matter.  There is consensus within the House.  We saw in the previous D&aacute;il and Seanad, where we had cross-party working groups on many different issues, from symphysiotomy to mental health, that we can bring change and we can affect how Government and how the world sees us.<br\/><br\/>The former Minister of State, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, spoke about health and criminal justice.  I agree with him.  We need to take a twin approach to the issue of drugs.  It is about justice, health, education, employment and other parts of that, and it is important that we speak with one voice.  I agree with him that the McMahon report is the beginning and it is important that we bring reform because, as I said earlier, there are young children, in particular, who are very badly affected.  We all meet them in our constituency offices and in our constituencies as we walk about every day.  Their parents cannot work and they are being treated as second-class citizens in terms of their ability to go about their lives.  It is important that we see reform here.<br\/><br\/>My colleague, friend and former Minister of State, Senator Coffey, spoke about skills and he is right; we have a deficit of skills in many areas.  When we see our tourism figures increasing and advertisements for chefs abroad, it poses the question of why we stopped the training of chefs in our country.  I agree that we need to discuss skills not just in the construction sector, but across<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>the whole economy.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, in his previous life, launched a national skills strategy.  It was an important beginning, but it cannot be left to gather dust on a shelf.  We must see active implementation of it.  I agree with Senator Coffey.  I remember he raised the issue in a previous Seanad when he was there.  It is a matter to which we need to return.<br\/><br\/>Senator Leyden, along with Senators Richmond and &Oacute; Donnghaile, raised Brexit.  It was my hope to have a debate on that this week, but both the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, are away.  I hope we will have that debate next week in the House because it is a very important discussion that we need to have.  We need to urge our Irish voters in the UK and in the North of our country to vote to remain.  From an economic point of view, the UK is critical to us and it is important that we have that debate.  I urge all Members of the House, if they have the opportunity, to travel in person to the North to canvass at the weekend or to use social media to advocate for a vote to remain.  It is not about us interfering, rather it is about us, as citizens of Europe and as Irish citizens, asking our fellow countrymen and women to vote to remain.<br\/><br\/>Senator Craughwell spoke about getting off on a bad foot.  I look forward to working with everyone to ensure this is a productive, meaningful Seanad.  We cannot produce legislation just like that.  A hiatus took place in the other House.  I have asked that some of the legislation would be initiated in this House.  It is important that we try to achieve some measure of balance in this regard.  I do not agree with the Senator regarding the constituency.  We all represent people and it is our duty to advocate on behalf of people.  The issue he raised regarding medals for the men and women who served for our country should be looked at and I will take it up with the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, on Senator Craughwell's behalf.<br\/><br\/>Senator Devine raised Cloverhill Prison.  I have not got the answer to her question on that, but I will take it up with the Minister.  She might want to raise it as a matter on the Commencement as well, to give her an opportunity to articulate that viewpoint.  I agree with her in regard to the men and women who are midwives and nurses.  They do great work every day in our hospitals.  I had the pleasure of working as a porter in Cork University Hospital when I was in college and I saw at first hand the work they do every day.  She might write to the health committee to ask it to take up the issue.  She has raised an important issue.  I have not got the answer, but I will take it up on her behalf with the Minister.<br\/><br\/>Senator Feighan raised hotel rooms and prices, and he is right.  As one of its first acts, the last Government cut the VAT rate on the basis that we would see an increase in tourism figures and that has happened.  Now we are seeing greed or profiteering where hotels have started to raise their prices.  Those Senators who stay in hotels in Dublin will have seen the increase in prices in a five-year period.  It is not just that, because it is about the tourism product we are selling and ensuring that we as a country remain viable and attractive from a tourist perspective to encourage people to travel here.  If they see escalating costs, I am afraid of what will happen.  We will take it up with the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy O'Donovan, who has strong views about the price of bed nights in Dublin and across the country.<br\/><br\/>I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for her kind remarks and compliment her on the issue she has been pursuing regarding end-of-life care.  It is an important topic and I hope we will again see a cross-party approach to it.  She has been spearheading that issue.  End-of-life care is a very important matter that we as a society have not addressed.  It is an issue we need to continue to work on.  I had the pleasure in the health committee I chaired in the last D&aacute;il of being part of the work we produced on end-of-life care.  I am glad Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has taken that up and it is important that we as a collective, in both Houses, work to ensure we have a strategy around it.<br\/><br\/>Senator Colette Kelleher also raised carers and the whole issue around home care and the fair deal.  I fully agree with her in that regard.  It is important that we see change regarding that area.  Senator Kelleher brings to the House not just her work in regard to Alzheimer's disease with the Alzheimer's Society, but also a great deal of work with the Cork Simon Community, the Cope Foundation in Cork and the disability sector.  She is right and I hope we can bring change in that area.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway spoke very eloquently about education and how we can eliminate bullying or peer pressure.  Thankfully, in the previous D&aacute;il, the two former Ministers, Ruair&iacute; Quinn and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, introduced major changes in the curriculum and the primary development area in regard to homophobic bullying and bullying in general.  I hope we will see a much better result from that.  It is important that we continue to see our education system and curriculum reflect a more modern society than was there before.<br\/><br\/>Senator Keith Swanick raised old district hospitals.  I remind him that in the last Government there was a capital investment programme in regard to our district hospitals.  I hope we will see that continue.  He is right that they are a resource we can use as a step-down facility where we can bring people to stay before we bring them back to their own homes.  I pay tribute to the former Minister, now Senator Reilly, who was instrumental in seeing change brought about there, which is important.  The Minister for Health will be in the House next week.  I hope to have debates on health and mental health.  I will come back to that area again.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan raised the infrastructure fund.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will come before us.  The Government has prioritised housing and we have seen a significant amount of investment signalled in that regard.  We are creating a stand-alone Department for housing.  It is a crisis we need to see resolved.  My colleague, Senator Coffey, when he was a Minister of State, was very strong and pivotal in starting the relaunch of the housing policy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that this work continues and I will certainly ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney to come before the House to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of Brexit.

Sport unites people and I am very happy Lee McLaughlin has been found.  I join the Senator in sympathising with the family of Darren Rodgers.  I thank and compliment the Irish supporters who paid tribute to him during the championships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FF00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#HH00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I wish our team every success in the remainder of the championships in France.  I think we all saw them play on Monday night - I know I am digressing a little but Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has raised the point - and there was a great uplift among people, perhaps not at the end of the game, which ended in a draw, but we certainly got off to a reasonably good start.  There is confidence now that we can see and it is important that we support each other.  I would be happy to talk to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile regarding the matter in question.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan's remarks are quite clear and very strong with regard to disability and carers.  The Senator has huge background experience in this regard.  I have worked with him in the past and I look forward to working with him again in the future.  It is good that we have individuals such as Senators Freeman, Kelleher and Dolan in the House in regard to the interests of people - I will not say sectoral interests - because they come with first-hand knowledge.  I know Senator Dolan is a very persistent person and I look forward to working with him.<\/p> <p>Senator Noone raised the very important issue of obesity and stated that unless we, as a nation, tackle this problem, particularly as it relates to juveniles, we will be in serious trouble.  I commend the Senator on her tremendous work in the previous Seanad and pay tribute to her for that.  I also wish to acknowledge former Senator Eamonn Coghlan whose Steps for Life programme is one that I hope will come to fruition.  We have the Healthy Ireland umbrella and I hope that, as part of Seanad's programme of work, the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, will come before the House to discuss this every important issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the matter of carers and also the issue of T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g respite services in Carlow.  I do not have an answer for her on that matter but I will certainly be happy to speak to the Minister on her behalf in respect of it.  I know the town of Carlow quite well so I would be very happy to ensure that whatever the Senator requires will be pursued there.  Deputy Pat Deering also raised this issue with me.  The matter in question is one that requires work and if the Senator gives me the details, I would be happy to take them to the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised an issue similar to that raised by Senator Coffey about the importance of education.  There is a concern around third-level dropout rates, particularly in the first year of college, either through lack of information or students choosing the wrong courses.  It is about having proper information and guidance and it is important to have a strong look at how we can keep people in suitable courses.  Equally, I am of the view that if a student drops out of a course, then he or she and his or her family should not necessarily be penalised all of the time.  The Senator is correct with regard to the issue of stress among students at second level.  I look forward to bringing the new Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the issues of the second-level curriculum and stress among students.<\/p> <p>Senator Richmond raised the issue of Brexit and the European funding of the Erasmus+ programme.  I would be happy to take this up with the Minister.  I compliment the Senator on the role he plays in the pro-European movement.  It is important - and I repeat what I said earlier - that all Members get active in the context of promoting a vote to remain.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson's suggestion in respect of the Passport Office is a good one.  If he was to go by what happens in my office, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would be aware that there is an issue with people either being late with their applications or forgetting about the expiration date on their passports.  The Senator is right in that people receive reminders regarding different bills.  This is a matter in respect of which, if possible, people might benefit from receiving reminders.  What the Senator said makes common sense.  Sometimes the common-sense approach is the best approach to take because it means that people can avoid a great deal of hassle, fear and panic.  All of us in the House would have received requests regarding passports.  The Senator is correct in this regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of child care and funding.  It is a fair point to request that a children's committee be established but it is important to recognise that the previous Government established Tusla, put in place an extra year of child care and changed the child care landscape.  However, it is also important that we work with the child care sector to ensure that remuneration levels and conditions of service are improved.  The zero-to-three or even zero-to-five age group is important.  It is vital, therefore, that we invest adequately in child care because if we do so, then the cost will be paid later in life.  We look forward to receiving any proposals the Senator wishes to put forward.  It is important to advance the issue of child care and prioritise the early years sector.  The Senator will find no issue with me in that regard.<\/p> <p>I compliment Senator Black on her very personal and important contribution to the House.  She is correct in respect of alcohol and gambling.  Concerns around online gambling need to be addressed.  I had the pleasure of working on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and it is on the Government list for publication.  It is an important Bill because we, as a nation, have an issue with alcohol consumption, not just in terms of volume but also with regard to binge drinking.  We have heard stories in recent weeks of many sporting people speaking about their gambling addictions.  It is quite easy for a person to pick up his or her mobile phone and use an app.  With the press of a button one can spend X amount of money, perhaps without even knowing it.  That might be a simplistic view but it is one in respect of which we need to be very vigilant.  I look forward to working with Senator Black on this matter.<\/p> <p>Health care was raised by Senator Burke and I believe he is right that the talks between the Department, the HSE, the two doctors' groups - the IMO and the NAGP - need to be brought to fruition because our primary care system is dependent upon doctors playing a pivotal role.  I hope to see that change happen.  With regard to attendance at hospitals I hope the hospital groups will see a change and that there will be a better and improved system by means of which waiting times can be tackled.<\/p> <p>Senator Daly referred to national guidelines on wind energy.  I will be happy to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is responsible for the planning element for that sector, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, who is involved in the other element, to come before the House to discuss this important matter.  The Senator also raised the issue of thoroughbreds, a topic on which I have also received representations and to which consideration should be given.<\/p> <p>Senator Landy spoke about councillors who are not just responsible for electing many of us to this House but who also play a very important role in terms of how government and local government work.  The Senator is correct in that the role of councillors has changed considerably.  We need to reflect on how we can put in place training and resources to improve how they do their business.  I was very pleased that Senator Paddy Burke tabled a Commencement Matter on the issue earlier.  I know that the Fine Gael group had a meeting yesterday on this on topic to see how the cause of conscience can be advanced.  It is important that all Members work collaboratively on the issue.  I know that Senators Craughwell and Bohan have their motion on the Order Paper and Senator Davitt also raised the matter in regard to councillors.  If Members speak with one voice rather than all going off half-cocked, a better return might be had for our councillors who are, in many cases, working full-time in their positions, with little or no remuneration or resources.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Reilly raised the important issue of Bailieboro Garda station.  From speaking to the Senator, I am aware that this is a matter about which he is extremely concerned.  I will ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to communicate with him on this matter.  If Senator O'Reilly requires a debate on the matter in the House, we would be happy to facilitate him.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the matter of local government and councillors.  I fully agree with him in the context of what he said.  I hope we will work together on the issue.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Donnell spoke on public expenditure reform and procurement.  This is a concern for many small and medium-sized enterprises that are locked out of the procurement process because of the tendering procedures that apply.  It is important that we should debate the matter with the Minister and I will try to organise such a debate as early as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher joined Senator Black and others in commenting on the role of councillors and in referring to concerns around online gambling.  It is important that we should also debate these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#HH00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Senator Michael McDowell has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 11 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated that he is prepared to accept the amendment.

Wherever institutions were being threatened with closure, she worked with communities to ensure patients got the care and support they needed.  She was very passionate on that issue in particular.

As leader of the Labour Party group, I am delighted to do so.  I have worked with Denis for the past five years.  Many of those who were Senators during the previous session will know Denis as an active and highly engaged Senator.  For those who do not know him and are new to the House, Denis is from Carrick-on-Suir.  He was a councillor for many years before his election to the Seanad in 2011, and he has long experience of chairing meetings at local level as a councillor as well as at national and European level.  Colleagues may be unaware that Denis previously chaired a committee within the Committee of the Regions at EU level.

Senator Coghlan comes to this position today with a huge volume of experience in local and national government along with his tremendous business acumen from his role as a business person.  He is also a husband and a father and will bring to the role of Leas-Chathaoirleach an experienced voice and a fair perspective that will embrace all sides of the House.  In all his time in this House, Senator Coghlan, I am sure, has never had a cross word with anyone.  He was elected to Killarney Town Council in 1985, Kerry County Council in 1991 and to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1997.  As we all will remember from the Seanad election just gone, Senator Coghlan's Lazarus-like resurrection, thanks to a huge outpouring of transfers, will testify to his warmth and the goodwill towards him across the political divide.  He will bring to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach a wide network of friends and contacts with which he can work.<\/p> <p>It is also as a Member of this House that Senator Coghlan has demonstrated his ability to work on many different issues.  These include banking and industry and commerce issues as well as issues regarding, in particular, the British-Irish Parliamentary Association where he was the chairperson of Committee A.  This committee produced an important report on illicit trade and police co-operation and the Government accepted the recommendation on a task force in this report.<\/p> <p>Equally, his efforts in regard to the cultural life in Kerry, in particular Muckross House, have shown his ability to work in many different facets.  Those of us who know Senator Coghlan will know and understand his love and passion for Muckross.  He was a trustee and a former chairman of Muckross House and revolutionised and transformed it into a very important visitor centre for the people of Killarney.

We are blessed on this occasion that all the candidates proposed, and the candidate I am proposing, are suitable people to be appointed Vice Chairman of this House as the Cathaoirleach was to be appointed Chairman.  All are people worthy of the position, I have no doubt.  The only way to ensure that in future this House takes its autonomy seriously and elects the person it really wants to have in a position, rather than engaging in horse-trading among various outside interests or the interests of the Government or the Opposition - because the new politics may not always prevail - is to make the changes to the Standing Orders of this House that were made to the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to provide for a system of election by secret ballot on a proportional representation basis.  That was done in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a result of a campaign.  I played a minor part in that campaign, speaking in Glenties in Donegal about the necessity of it.  A campaign was carried out to ensure that the last D&aacute;il was not dissolved without making the position of Cathaoirleach autonomous and elected by the Members without reference to party whips, diktats from the Government or deals between parties, but on the basis that each individual Member, voting with his or her conscience, experience and judgment, voted for the candidate he or she thought best.  This House should follow the precedent the other House has set to give itself the scope of private judgment to decide these matters rather than to read about them in the newspapers.  I read a fortnight ago what was likely to happen today and that people were putting together deals on positions in the other House.  This does not apply to Senator Coghlan but I read in one newspaper article that a particular outcome had been bartered between two groups, depending on support in one House for one outcome and for another outcome in this House.  That is not right.  <\/p> <p>Turning to the merits of my candidate, Senator Craughwell is a former president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI.  He has immense experience chairing individual institutions.  He has chaired conferences.  He has chaired the national executive committee of the TUI and joint meetings between the TUI, the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  He has chaired further education and training committees and the organisation and training committee of the TUI.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell came into this House by the Independent route.  He has no party political baggage behind him.  He would discharge his function in a totally independent and non-partisan way.  Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to nominate him.  In nominating Senator Craughwell, Senator Boyhan and I want to make it clear that the group to which we belong, the Seanad Independent group, is not allied to any other political party and is not part of some informal coalition.  We will exercise our independent judgment on all issues, and in that spirit and for that reason, I commend the election of Senator Gerard Craughwell as Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#KK00600","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I endorse what Senator McDowell said, first in respect of the call for a secret ballot for these positions.

That is a challenge to all of us as Senators with our respective contacts and parties.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell is neither an undertaker nor a caretaker but has proved himself very hardworking.  I spoke to several independent councillors yesterday about local government reform and local councils and they asked me would it ever be possible for an Independent to be elected to either of these prestigious positions.

We have been dealt figures and numbers on the returns in the last general election and the last Seanad election.

I wish you well in your role and I congratulate you and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I also wish the new Leader of the House and the other Members of the Seanad well in their deliberations.<\/p> <p>I am in the House on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to discuss the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  The House will recall that the Act was enacted following the callous Omagh bombing, a terrorist atrocity in which 29 innocent people lost their lives.  That appalling act lives in all our memories and our sympathies remain with the victims and their families.<\/p> <p>The 1998 Act made a series of amendments to the Offences Against the State Acts.  It principally provides for changes in the rules of evidence for certain offences under the Acts, including the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances; the creation of new offences such as directing an unlawful organisation, the possession of certain articles and collecting information; and extending to 72 hours the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  The Omagh atrocity demanded a clear and resolute response from the State in defence of the desire of the vast majority of law abiding people on this island to live their lives in peace.<\/p> <p>Section 18 of the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force.  By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2015, these sections were continued in force for a period of 12 months.  Prior to moving a motion for renewal, the Act requires that the Minister lays before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions.  The current report covers the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and was laid before the House on 10 June 2016.<\/p> <p>Given the time available, I will not go through all of the relevant sections in detail.  The report, based on information provided by the Garda authorities, sets out the detail of usage of the various sections over the period.  The report also includes a table of comparative usage for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  The report indicates that two sections, sections 6 and 12, were not used during the reporting period in question.  However, it should not be inferred that these provisions are in some way redundant as the usage of the different sections can vary from year to year.  It is the clear view of the Garda Commissioner that the Act continues to be a most important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report.  They are, in short, a necessary legislative support in the fight against terrorism.<\/p> <p>There remains on this island a persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups who are simply opposed to peace.  These groups have no support; they have no reason to remain in being and they should go away for good.  The T&aacute;naiste's decision to bring the second Special Criminal Court into operation is in response to this threat.  It is now up and running and it underlines the Government's determination to deal with serious crime affecting the security of the State.  The threat level in Northern Ireland is severe.  The appalling murder of the Northern Ireland prison officer, Adrian Ismay, earlier this year highlights the lethal nihilism of these groups, who act in direct opposition to the democratic wishes of the majority on this island.<\/p> <p>The Garda authorities work tirelessly and in co-operation with their counterparts in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, in countering the activities of these paramilitary organisations, and they deserve credit for their ongoing work.  Combatting the security threat is a key priority for the Government and the additional funding the T&aacute;naiste has secured for the Garda Vote this year will go in part towards support for measures against terrorism.  The Government is determined that these groups will never prevail and that there will be no let up in actions to tackle them.  It would be a happy day indeed if provisions in the law such as those we are discussing today were no longer needed because the threat they target was no longer in place.  The sad truth, however, is that they are still needed because that threat persists.<\/p> <p>I will now refer to the second motion to be discussed on section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  This proposes the continuation in force for another year of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  This section provides for a limited number of serious, organised crime offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court, thus removing the possibility of jury tampering or the intimidation of jurors or potential jurors.  The offences in question are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and they are section 71A - directing the activities of a criminal organisation; section 72 - participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation; section 73 - committing a serious offence for a criminal organisation; and section 76 - liability for these offences committed by a body corporate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The 2009 Act makes these scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  While this means that the Special Criminal Court will hear trials for these offences, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, retains the power to direct that the offences should be tried in the ordinary courts.<\/p><p>In order to assist Senators in their consideration, section 8(6) provides that the Minister must prepare a report, which shall be laid before both Houses, on the operation of the section.  That report, covering the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016, was laid before the House on 10 June 2016.  Section 8 was not used during the period in question.  Indeed, it has not been used since 2009.  This does not invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use if it is needed nor does it diminish its potential value in bringing organised criminals to justice.  The operation of the provision to date highlights the considered approach of the DPP in using her discretion to direct that cases would be tried in the ordinary courts where it is possible to do so.  This is proof positive of the balance that has been struck with this provision.  It is a robust but nonetheless proportionate power.  <\/p><p>In the period under report, there were a total of 17 arrests under two of the four offences covered by section 8 - seven arrests under section 72 and a further ten under section 73.  Sections 71A and 76 were not used in the reporting period in question.  Of course, there is a variety of other provisions of the criminal law that have been and are being used against organised criminals.  My Department is currently examining whether there are other changes to the law that might be made to tackle these gangs.  The Minister will be bringing forward shortly changes to the law to strengthen the powers of CAB in respect of seizing the proceeds of crime.<\/p><p>None of us can be under any illusion about the danger to society from organised crime.  Recent gang-related murders in the Dublin region put into stark relief the utter disregard of these criminals for human life and the rule of law.  Counteracting this danger presents very real challenges for the State.  However, the State has faced down such gangs in the past and it will do so again.<\/p><p>The Government is fully committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to confront these criminal thugs and to bring them to justice.  To this end, as I have said, the Minister secured substantial additional funding of &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the remainder of 2016 that will, among other things, support the necessary activities to target gang-related crime.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner has made clear her view that this provision will be required for some time to come and we must have the utmost regard for her analysis.  Trial by jury is the standard for our system and it should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can afford to ignore the threat to the rule of law from violent, organised criminals who will stop at literally nothing to protect themselves and their profits.  We have a duty as legislators to ensure that we respond robustly but proportionately to that threat.  I commend these motions to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#SS01300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>This debate has a time constraint of 50 minutes.

On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I voice our support for the two motions before the Seanad today.  Both the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 require that certain sections of the Acts be renewed by the Oireachtas on an annual basis.  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently supported the renewal of these sections and does so today as it feels that both statutory provisions are necessary.  We hope that in the future, the threat of dissident republican activity on this island will no longer be a reality but until then, we must have effective mechanisms to deal with it.<\/p> <p>In the aftermath of the shocking act of terror in Orlando, we are reminded of the ever-present threat of international terrorism.  Unfortunately, Ireland is not immune to this threat.  It is, therefore, not appropriate to remove the powers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time when there is no evidence that these powers have been abused.  Our police force needs to have the ability to act immediately in the face of terrorism.   <\/p> <p>Section 8 of the 2009 Act allows serious organised gangland crime to be tried by the Special Criminal Court similar to some of the proposals contained in the Offences against the State Act.  The operation of drug gangs in Ireland is to the forefront of our minds due to the horrific murder in the Regency Hotel in February 2016 and subsequent murders.  Communities are being terrorised and are calling for a tough response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p> <p>Opposition to these provisions is mainly based on the fact that these crimes are tried in Special Criminal Court settings without a jury.  Unfortunately, some offences cannot be tried by jury as it would jeopardise the safety of jury members.  We have a duty to ensure our criminal justice system operates fairly.  This system cannot operate if jury members can be intimidated or harmed in any way.  Gangland criminals have murdered journalists and innocent members of the public in broad daylight.  Intimidating jury members would not be beyond the pale.  Witnesses were intimidated during the trial of four members of the Provisional IRA for the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  This intimidation resulted in the lesser charge of manslaughter being laid against the four accused.  If witnesses have been intimidated in the past by dissident republicans, there is a real possibility that jury members will also face intimidation in the future should these provisions not be renewed.  <\/p> <p>Putting in place the witness protection programme for jury members, which has been suggested in the past, would be completely unworkable.  Trial by jury was provided for in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to ensure a fair criminal justice system.  Due to the nature of the crimes that are the subject of these provisions, trial without jury is required to achieve the same outcome - a fair criminal justice system.  Therefore, I support these motions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#TT00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him every success in his new role in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I think it is his first occasion in here as Minister of State.  I welcome the motions, which have my full support.  It is important that we give the necessary support to the garda&iacute;, who are working at the coal face.  History has shown that unless that support had been there, it would not have been possible in the years gone by to take criminal proceedings against certain people.  The Special Criminal Court has at all times been very effective and very fair.  The criminal justice system in this country has always been very balanced.  Where there is any threat to a fair trial and a prosecution cannot proceeding because jurors might be intimidated, it is important that the appropriate procedures are put in place.  This is the reason two pieces of legislation were passed.<\/p> <p>It is also important that there are checks and balances and that they are not abused.  This is the reason the provisions come back for review every 12 months.  It is extremely important that they receive our full support here today.  The Minister and Minister of State do not take this decision lightly.  They take it because they have received the advice that in respect of the criminal justice system operating properly, certain elements could not be prosecuted unless these procedures are in place.  This is the reason they are bringing forward these motions and why they seek the continuance of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the appropriate section in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.   <\/p> <p>I also welcome the fact that an extra &euro;55 million has been allocated to the garda&iacute; to give them the necessary back-up support because they cannot operate unless they have sufficient support and expertise to deal with criminal elements in this country.  Crime is becoming more sophisticated and a way of sidestepping the garda&iacute; and the judicial process is available to the criminal community.  It is important that we have the appropriate procedures for the garda&iacute; and the DPP.

All parties across this island must be both united and relentless in our pursuit of ending criminality.  It must be made clear that those responsible for the recent killings and the ongoing feud in Dublin or anyone involved in organised crime must face the courts and be brought to justice.  There can be no equivocation in respect of that.  If they are found guilty and prosecuted, then they must face the sentences handed down to them.  There is no equivocation in that.<\/p> <p>The Minister spoke yesterday evening in the D&aacute;il about improved and increased resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help combat organised crime.  It should be noted that in recent years it was the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that closed Templemore and stopped recruitment of members to the force, a measure continued by the previous Fine Gael Government, but now both want a tough response to such matters.  While I welcome the recent announcement of increased investment in tackling crime, it has to go beyond investment in armed response units.  If we want long-term solutions to deal with organised crime, we need to prevent young people from going down that path in life.  We need to invest in programmes with a proven track record of working, such as the youth and juvenile diversion programmes.  These are areas in which we need increased investment.  The legislation we are being asked to extend today for a further 12 months does not have the effect of ending criminality in communities.  It clearly has not worked, although it has been in existence for the past 20 years.  We also have to look at international best practice and what actually does work.  What does is increased investment at community level in meaningful programmes that prevent young people from engaging in criminality.  It is important to say that it is not only young people who engage in criminality.  Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to criminality and we will support any measure we feel will work towards ending it.<\/p> <p>The Fresh Start agreement negotiated in November last year by the Executive in the North deals with measures around stronger law enforcement and co-operation with the Government in this State, aimed at tackling organised crime and criminality.  A new joint agency task force has been established, led at senior management level by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and Revenue and Customs.  This new inter-agency task force will bring together the expertise of a range of law enforcement agencies involved in tackling organised crime gangs that seek to exploit the Border between the two jurisdictions.  The Good Friday Agreement, which preceded it, requires steps towards security normalisation, including the progressive elimination of the Act's provisions.  It is not justifiable to continue with this legislation with the Good Friday Agreement now in place for a full 18 years.<\/p> <p>No emergency exists that could justify the continuation of the draconian measures contained in the sections that are up for renewal, or the rest of the Offences against the State Acts.  This legislation has a highly corrosive effect on human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in this State.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are not alone in our opinion of that, given that the UN Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International and many other groups have stated this issue needs to be dealt with by this State as a matter of urgency.  Certainly from a northern perspective, I have worked with the PSNI and seen the change in policing, moving away from a very negative, draconian and oppressive culture.  Although the change is still incomplete and imperfect, much has been achieved in terms of independent oversight and creating a force that is community oriented and compliant with human rights.  There are lessons to be learned to set the highest possible standard for international best practice for both policing services across this island, which puts the ending of criminality, but also the rights of and protections for citizens, at its heart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#UU00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to the House.  It is my first opportunity to do so and I think it is his first opportunity to be here with us.  I welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment, having working with him on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which he so ably chaired for the past five years.  I know he will do a great job and I wish him the very best with his work.<\/p> <p>On the motions before us, I welcome the opportunity to be back debating them.  Every 12 months these provisions have to be reviewed.  It is important that the Oireachtas keeps these provisions under scrutiny, given that they interfere with due process rights of accused persons.  It is in that context that we are back here.  Having said that, we all recognise the major threat posed in particular by organised crime.  We would all be very conscious of events in Dublin's north inner city and the real fear that so many members of that community are living under.  We all watched the Taoiseach and other Ministers meeting community leaders last night in the north inner city.  Clearly, there is a significant threat from organised crime and from paramilitary crime.<\/p> <p>I should declare an interest as somebody who practised as a barrister in the Special Criminal Court in previous years.  I have been here, speaking on the renewal of these provisions, for some years.  We need to keep them under scrutiny.  On a practical level, while a report has been laid before the Oireachtas, in previous years a table of usage has been appended to the Minister's speech which we have been provided with in advance of each of these debates.  It is very useful to see for ourselves the pattern of application of the provision.  That would be very helpful.  I know the Minister of State dealt with this a little in his speech, but it is also useful to have the overview provided to us.<\/p> <p>Looking first at the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 motion and its renewal, as has been said, these provisions do depart from normal principles of due process.  Section 3 requires an accused to give notice of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf when charged with membership of an unlawful organisation, and section 4 potentially gives rise to guilt by association, allowing inferences to be drawn from conduct such as associations on the part of the accused concerning evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation, an offence which, we will all be conscious, is a very serious one.  I looked previously at a 15-year pattern of usage of these provisions and some of them were not used for many years.  This requires that we look at the utility of continuing them in force.  Section 4, in fact, had not been used for some years between 2008 and 2014 and was then used.  Having said that, as the Minister of State said, the fact a provision is not used for some years does not mean it will not be and that it will not be useful.  We need to take a balanced approach to this.  In the Minister of State's speech, he said that two sections, sections 6 and 12, were not used during the reporting period in question, that is, the past year.  While the Minister of State pointed out that it should not be inferred that these sections are redundant, as the usage varies from year to year, as we have seen in the past, it is still something that requires us to keep under review.  I understand that section 12 has not been used since 2002.  That is 14 years in which section 12 has not been used.  There is a strong question to be asked about keeping the utility of that provision under review. <\/p> <p>I will deal briefly with the motion on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  We are looking at another provision that interferes with due process rights.  Section 8 provides for the right to a jury trial to be bypassed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in respect of certain offences.  In the period under review, no cases were in fact sent forward to the Special Criminal Court through the exercise of the DPP's discretion.  Indeed, since 2009, no cases have been sent forward under that provision.  Section 8 has not been used since 2009, as the Minister of State has said.  I said last year that this indicates the considered approach that is being taken by the DPP.  She is not exercising her discretion on this in any very liberal fashion.  That is right and proper, given the encroachment that section 8 represents.<\/p> <p>However, one also has to look behind section 8 and look at the provisions it refers to, which are laid out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Looking at those provisions, it is clear from the Minister of State's speech today and from speeches and data we were given in previous years that sections 72 and 73, the two offences of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation and committing a serious offence, are well used.  The Minister of State pointed out there were seven arrests under section 72 and a further ten under section 73.  However, he says, section 71A, directing the activities of a criminal organisation, and section 76, liability for these offences committed by a body corporate, have not been exercised.  Looking back, they have not been exercised for the past three years, as far as I know.  One should look at the merit of retaining those offences in their current form and whether there is something about those offences that makes them unworkable.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Clearly the directing of activities of a criminal organisation is an offence which one would hope should have a utility on the Statute Book given the very serious offences that have been committed in the name of criminal organisations in recent months.

I certainly do not oppose these motions but we need to keep these motions under careful scrutiny and to be critical, where necessary, of aspects of these motions without simply passing them every year in a knee jerk or token way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#UU00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCathaoirleach.  I welcome Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I congratulate him on his appointment as a Minster of State.  As Senator Bacik has said, the Minister of State brought years of dedicated service to the justice committee and I was pleased, as chairmen of the health committee that worked in a cross-departmental way with him on the issue of drugs.  I wish him well.<\/p> <p>It is important that in the Minister of State's speech it says that this Act is an important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and that we must ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government have every tool available to them in the war and the fight against organised crime.  We must eradicate organised crime.<\/p> <p>I listened to Senator Dolan's comments and I agree with some of what he said about how we can tackle this through education, empowerment and rebuilding our inner cities in particular, through working in a cross-departmental and cross-sectoral community way to make life better for people.  That can begin in a multiplicity of ways.  However, if we do not allow for the State to be able to do its work and to have resources such as these Bills, then we are in big trouble.<\/p> <p>Equally, the issue of resourcing, the rostering of staff, community garda&iacute; and education are very important.  We saw the amount of money which was invested through RAPID into inner city areas.  I worked with RAPID on Cork City Council where we enhanced the public realm and domain in the streetscapes, along with the quality of life for people.  That means we must look at the issue of child care and its affordability, housing and affordable housing in tandem with resourcing our garda&iacute; and ensuing that our community leaders and our citizens, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the courts, can tackle and eradicate gangland crime.<\/p> <p>It is important that this cycle is ended and, equally, that we work together to ensure a situation whereby we do not need these types of legislation because, as Senator Bacik rightly said, some of the legislation has not been used at all.  When we talk about new politics it is important that we take new politics out of the Chamber and - following on from the visit by the Taoiseach yesterday evening to the inner city - that we can ensure there is a new way of doing business.  A way where community leaders and those who are employed by the State, by the city councils and by NGOs in tandem with active volunteers can make life better and that the culture and attitude among people will change also.  I say this as someone who has been in schools - and as the Minister of State knows from his own background - education is critical.  Empowering young people and giving them a dream of a better future and a vision of a better life is a great step forward.  I hope the visit of the Taoiseach last night is not just seen as a photo opportunity - as was reported in some of the papers today - but that this would be the beginning of something different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#VV00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their welcome and their kind words, I hope it lasts.  I am grateful to the Seanad for its consideration of these matters today. I thank Senators on all sides for their contributions to the debate on both motions.  Naturally I welcome the support expressed by a number of speakers for continuing these provisions.  I also appreciate the shared commitment that exists in the House to maintaining in place a robust legal framework for the Garda and the courts when dealing with the most serious of offences that may threaten the State and the operation of the criminal justice system.  I also recognise there are genuinely expressed concerns about the robust nature of these provisions.  However, we simply cannot ignore the fact of the activities of so-called dissident paramilitaries and neither can we ignore the fact of the grave threat from gang-related crime.<\/p> <p>The ongoing action of the Garda in combatting the paramilitary groups including, fortunately, seizures of explosives and firearms, bears witness to the real and persistent threat presented by these groups to people in this State and in Northern Ireland.  These terrorist groups have no support and no mandate.  They cannot now and never will offer anything positive.  We must do all we can, within the law, to stop them.  By the same token, the Garda continues daily to take action against the criminal gangs whose activities seek to undermine society.  The recent series of gang-related murders in the Dublin region bears witness to the ruthlessness and lawlessness of these criminals.<\/p> <p>As public representatives we have all seen the profound damage that drugs in particular have inflicted on communities across the State.  We cannot be blind to the fact that there are serious criminals who are only too happy to feed on that misery and misfortune and who will literally stop at nothing to protect their well-funded lifestyles.  I take on board the comments made by Senators Dolan, Buttimer and others about the other side of the coin such as boosting communities, education, services, youth services, youth centres and so on which are vitally important also.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that we are dealing with ruthless people.<\/p> <p>In the face of these threats we must, as legislators, do our utmost to ensure the protection of the State and its institutions and to protect the lives of our citizens.  In doing so we must strike a balance between necessity and proportionality.  This is not always an easy balance to strike but I am of the clear view that this balance is achieved by these provisions.  While they are outside the normal course of the criminal law, the measures are a response to extraordinary circumstances.  I would also emphasise that these provisions do not somehow operate in glorious isolation from the rest of the criminal law and the range of protections that are available in the criminal process and at trial for persons who are charged with serious offences.  We are fortunate to have a robustly independent and impartial Judiciary which has time and again proved to be the bulwark protecting the citizen's fundamental rights.  I remind Senators also that provisions of the Offences against the State Acts and the Special Criminal Court have faced challenges to their operation and constitutionality on many occasions in the Supreme Court and at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and have largely withstood these challenges.<\/p> <p>I remind the House also of the key role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the process, a role carried out independently in accordance with the law.  Some concerns were expressed as to the process for renewal of these provisions.  It may be difficult to identify an ideal way to do this but I would emphasise that the current arrangements place the legislators in control.  This House and the D&aacute;il, together, have the final say.  This is the democratic way and I believe it has much to recommend it.  The Garda deploys very considerable operational resources to tackle terrorism and organised crime and we as legislators must provide it and the courts with the necessary means to bring terrorists and serious criminals to justice.  I am sure that we all wish the circumstances where otherwise and that laws such as these were not needed.  However, the stark reality is that until conditions allow, these provisions are a necessary addition to the general criminal law.  I commend these motions to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#VV00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"vote","time":1465983000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 35; N\u00edl, 7.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Frank Feighan and Kieran O'Donnell; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Gavan and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#WW00100","aye":["1407","1402","1379","1380","1423","1391","1384","1376","1422","1420","1414","1383","1411","1424","1396","1415","1412","1417","1387","1393","1375","1425","1395","1392","1431","1410","1374","1427","1426","1397","1394","1421","1399","1373","1418"],"nay":["1408","1378","1388","1389","1400","1377","1413"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009: Motion","time":1465983000,"counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#XX00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (No. 32 of 2009) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 30 June 2016 and ending on 29 June 2017.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#XX00100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"vote","time":1465983000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 33; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Frank Feighan and Kieran O'Donnell; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Gavan and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#XX00200","aye":["1407","1402","1379","1380","1423","1391","1384","1376","1422","1420","1383","1411","1424","1396","1415","1412","1387","1375","1425","1401","1395","1392","1431","1410","1374","1427","1426","1397","1394","1421","1399","1373","1418"],"nay":["1378","1388","1389","1400","1377","1413"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Poverty and Homelessness: Motion","time":1465983000,"counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#YY00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:notes:<blockquote>- the most recent Central Statistics Office (CSO) Survey on Income and Living Conditions that shows the number of households suffering deprivation has risen from 24.5 per cent in 2011 to 30.5 per cent in 2013 and the number living in consistent poverty has risen from 6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent; and<br \/><br \/>- that the CSO also shows that the levels of deprivation and persistent poverty among one-parent families are even worse as the number of one-parent families suffering deprivation has risen by 13.7 per cent in just one year to 63.2 per cent in 2013 and the number living in consistent poverty has risen from 17.4 per cent to 23 per cent in the same period;<\/blockquote>condemns:<blockquote>- the consistent rise in poverty, deprivation and hardship amongst families in Ireland that has resulted in up to 5,000 families and children being homeless and housed in temporary accommodation across our cities and towns; and<br \/><br \/>- the policies that have created a situation whereby the latest statistics from 2013 show that 12 per cent of children aged 0-17 years are living in consistent poverty, up more than 137,000 from 9.9 per cent in 2012 and double the 6 per cent figure of 2008;<\/blockquote>and calls for:<blockquote>- urgent action to be taken to reduce the number of children being housed in emergency hotel accommodation;<br \/><br \/>- all local authorities to prioritise renovations to houses that need refurbishment so that children can be taken out of emergency hotel accommodation;<br \/><br \/>- funding to be made available to implement the recommendations from the Committee on Housing and Homelessness particularly to enable short term and co-ordinated actions to be taken to deliver more housing for families;<br \/><br \/>- an emergency building programme to directly build, as a matter of urgency, more social and affordable housing; and<br \/><br \/>- to increase rent support to a level that ensures no-one is made homeless or forced into poverty by unaffordable accommodation costs.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>While I am on my feet, I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his election.

I wish him the best of luck for the coming term.<\/p><p>I propose this motion on behalf of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, as we believe the scandal of over 2,000 homeless children in the State needs to be addressed and resolved immediately.  I thank the Minister of State for making himself available today to hear this debate.  At a pre-budget submission by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul yesterday, it was noted that it receives, on average, 2,300 calls per week from families that require its assistance to meet essential basic costs such as heating, food and clothing, and that is at a time of growth and recovery.  One in nine children is in consistent poverty, which means these children live in households where the income is below 60% of the national median income.  Children in lone-parent households are at a particular risk of consistent poverty and deprivation, and this deprivation can mean going 24 hours without a substantial meal, or being cold due to the fact that the parent cannot afford to heat the home.<\/p><p>Given these increases in poverty levels, homelessness among families has risen to what is now accepted to be a crisis level.  As I mentioned, more than 2,000 children are currently without a home and in emergency accommodation.  This figure does not include the many more thousands living in overcrowded homes, and thousands more still are one small step away from losing their homes.  Urgent action is needed to end the practice of housing homeless families in hotel rooms.  In the past number of weeks, Focus Ireland warned that the record number of homeless families combined with the pressure on hotel rooms due to increased economic activity means that the risk of families sleeping rough has re-emerged.  This is putting additional stress on parents and children in an already stressful position.<\/p><p>Hotel accommodation is wholly unsuitable for families, as children do not have space to play, a table on which to eat a meal or complete homework, or the privacy to develop and grow as individuals.  Educators and charities supporting children living in emergency hotel accommodation report that children are not able to get a proper night's sleep and are arriving at school sleep-deprived, which naturally has a knock-on effect on their ability to learn and thrive in school.  Often, hotel accommodation is far from schools, and this leads to days being missed more frequently.  This disruption to education has a lasting and long-term effect.  Children often report they feel the stigma of homelessness more acutely due to the fact they live in a hotel, as others who see them in their school uniform in a hotel know instantly that they are homeless.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the existence of empty local authority housing in our constituencies, and priority must be given to refurbishing these housing units so that families with children can be moved from hotel accommodation as quickly as possible, thereby giving these children the security of a permanent and high-quality roof over their heads.  Only with this stability and security can they enjoy a happy childhood and thrive.  I very much look forward to the publication of the report from the Committee on Housing and Homelessness this Friday, and I take this opportunity to thank the members of the committee for their diligence and commitment over the past number of weeks.  However, the recommendations of the committee regarding homeless families in emergency accommodation will only carry meaning and worth if the funding is provided to enable immediate and swift action; otherwise, they are moot.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged the lack of available housing has caused this crisis and it will only be solved on a long-term basis by the construction of more social and affordable housing.  We are calling for an emergency building programme to do this.  My colleague, Senator Murnane O'Connor, will speak further about this.  Families experiencing poverty and deprivation but who are currently in private rented accommodation need to be given assistance to remain in their homes in a climate where rents are ever-increasing.  It is much easier to keep a family in its home than to help a family that has lost its home.<\/p><p>Childhood is short.  The experiences we have as children shape the adults we become.  Children living in poverty and children living without the security of a permanent home live life on the margins of society.  They are unable to participate fully in the cultural activity of their community and struggle to reach their educational potential.  This has an impact on their health and opportunities in life.  Children who have experienced homelessness are far more likely to experience homelessness as adults and find it extremely difficult to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty.  In the centenary year of the Easter Rising, in particular, we must ensure all children have a home to call their own.  Therefore, I call on this House to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#YY00200","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I gladly second the motion, as it is critical.  The Minister of State is aware we have a very urgent housing crisis.

Also, can we have separate figures for Dublin and for the rural counties?  I would appreciate figures for both.<\/p><p>Second, the Minister will be aware that we have accommodation that is unfit, overcrowded, unsuitable or unsuitable due to exceptional medical needs or on compassionate grounds.  These are people in real need.  Their low priority is an indication that the Department has never highlighted them as a particular group.  When one goes to the local authority, one's name is put on a housing list.  Regardless of whether it is unfit or unsuitable accommodation, one's name goes on the housing list, but one is not in a particular group.  I ask the Minister to address this because it is an urgent issue.  These people in need must be made a priority.<\/p><p>The Department has long been informed of several sources for capitalising house purchases, whereby the rental money could be used to purchase houses instead of renting.  I have a major issue with this.  I believe the current crisis is due to the fact that we are renting or leasing and it is costing the Government and the country a fortune.  There are cases where the Department is promoting the leasing of units and has prohibited councils from purchasing priority housing for a small amount of money.  Councils are seeking to buy houses, but the Minister is not providing the money.  He is saying, in effect, that we will continue renting but will not buy the houses.  That is unfair.  I have some statistics from last year.  In 2015, some &euro;67 million was spent on renting, leasing and on hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.  We must look forward and progress.  We must buy and, as my colleague said, we must build housing.<\/p><p>I have a query for the Minister about capital construction.  This is construction of local authority houses.  There is a four stage plan for every local authority when it is building houses.  I ask the Minister to reduce this four stage plan to a single stage plan.  As he knows, when a local authority brings the first stage to the Department, it might not be returned for six months.  After sending the second stage, it could be another six months to get it back.  The timescale with this is not good enough.  We have a housing crisis so the Minister should change the four stage plan to a single stage plan.<\/p><p>There has been a housing crisis for the past two years, but I do not understand why the Minister and the Department, through the national spatial strategy, have reduced the amount of land zoned for housing.  Under the spatial strategy, local authorities have had to do what we could call de-zoning - we have de-zoned lands.  However, there is a need to build houses.  There is a report in the newspaper today of a recommendation to the housing Department to consider building 50,000 local authority houses.  I ask the Minister to change the national spatial strategy to enable us to build houses and give planning permission to build them, because we must.<\/p><p>There is major potential for the credit union sector to issue home loans to assist in meeting the major social need for housing.  I ask the Minister to examine this aspect.  In addition, I read a newspaper report today, although I understand this information emerged yesterday, that the Government is considering introducing legislation to put a moratorium on repossessions.  I beg the Government to do this.  This is probably one of the most urgent requirements of the Government - that it keep people and children in their homes.  We have a crisis and unless these simple things are addressed it will not be solved.  Renting is the reason we have a housing crisis today.<\/p><p>I have a question for the Minister relating to my local authority in Carlow.  Carlow is always forgotten.  A maximum rate is set to get on the local authority housing list and in Carlow it is &euro;25,000.  If one is earning &euro;25,000 one does not qualify to be put on the local authority housing list, yet in the neighbouring counties of Kilkenny, Laois and Wicklow the maximum is &euro;30,000.  Why is Carlow forgotten again?  Why is that Carlow people cannot be put at the top of the scale at &euro;30,000 like everybody else?  I urge the Minister to answer all of these questions, because they are serious issues.<\/p><p>In this day and age, it is criminal if every county in Ireland does not have a women's refuge for women and their children.  Carlow does not have a women's refuge, nor does it have emergency housing.  There is talk of &euro;200 million being allocated to emergency housing, so I ask the Minister to ensure that every county in Ireland has a women's refuge.  At present, there are buildings which are being sold for reasonable prices and I am aware that the Minister must work with the HSE and Tusla in this regard.  It is about everybody working together, but this must be done.  As I said, we are in a crisis.<\/p><p>I welcome the new tenant purchase scheme.  It had not been given to local authorities for over two years.  Who writes these schemes for local authorities?  Again, the most vulnerable in our community are not allowed to purchase their house.  The new tenant purchase scheme provides that there must be a 50% income coming into the household.  Old age pensioners who have just retired do not qualify and are not allowed to buy their house, even though they might have come into a certain amount of money or they might have been made redundant.  People who inherit money or who perhaps win money are not allowed to purchase their house.  Once again, the new tenant purchase scheme only suits very few.  Who drafts these schemes?  It just does not make sense.<\/p><p>My colleague referred to child poverty and homelessness.  Over the past year in Carlow, we set up a soup kitchen; we called it St. Clare's Hospitality.  With the summer approaching there will be more children and families attending, as the children are not in school.  We are trying to keep these families fed.  We also give food parcels to families that are most in need.  I am ashamed to say that when St. Clare's Hospitality set up the soup kitchen over a year ago, we could not get any streamlined funding from any Department to fund it.  We have a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis and we are setting up soup kitchens because people are hungry, but there is no funding from the Government.  With the &euro;200 million in funding and with all the Departments working together, the Minister must look after the poor and most vulnerable in our community.  I seek answers to my questions but I also seek results.  I want funding to go to these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#YY00300","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":232,"content":"<p><i>Bravo.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, and wish him and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, well.

Fine Gael agrees with much of its content and, in fact, much of what it proposes is already under way.<\/p> <p>I was formerly the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and was appointed to office in 2014 in the middle of the crisis.  Without pointing fingers or laying blame, the environment in which the Ministers are currently trying to meet this challenge must be acknowledged.  People ask why this happened.  The reason was obvious.  We had a bankrupt State in which, unfortunately, the local authorities had abdicated their responsibility for building houses for over a decade.  As a result of the economic crash, access to credit dried up both for builders and for individuals seeking to build their own homes.  In addition, repossessions began to take place.  We see the obvious result with homelessness.  It is a shame for this country.  It is something on which we all must work together, irrespective of party politics.  We are depending on local authorities, all political parties and on society in general to respond to this challenge in a responsible way.<\/p> <p>I commend the Ministers on the work they are undertaking now.  Many of the foundations for that were laid over the past few years.  The previous Government, despite the fact that the State was bankrupt when it took office in 2011, committed over &euro;4 billion to the social housing strategy, so it is not a matter of throwing funding at the problem.  I believe, as a result of my experience over the past two years, that it is about improving the efficiency of delivery of supply in both the public and private sectors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a lot to be learned in this regard.

Some Senators have alluded to the fact that there are too many barriers or stages in the approvals process.  The Minister has committed to undertaking a review of it, which is to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>Another measure taken recently is similar to the devolved scheme for schools under which local authorities can apply to the Department for a sum of &euro;2 million and it is then up to them, on receiving approval, to go ahead and build units with that amount of money.  I ask the Minister to tell the House how many local authorities have come forward to take advantage of that scheme since it was announced a number of months ago.  It is a quick, accessible way to address the housing crisis in many local authority areas and I would have thought that once the scheme was announced, local authorities would be breaking down the door of the Department to get projects up and running.  Under the scheme, no further approval is required once initial approval is given by the Department.  That is a welcome development and I urge all local authorities to take advantage of the scheme.<\/p><p>On homelessness, I agree with the content of the motion.  It is unacceptable that there are young families and children residing in emergency accommodation.  However, it is the reality in the current environment that building houses takes time because projects must go through the planning process, infrastructure must be put in place, tenders must be issued and construction must then take place.  I note that there has been criticism, some of it deserved, of the last Government and its failure to deliver.  However, I can say without fear or favour that funding, approvals and necessary mechanisms have been put in place to enable houses to be constructed.  I understand almost 200 construction projects are under way.  They were given the green light by the Department and will deliver houses as soon as possible.  It is important that local authorities and the project managers therein accelerate and complete these projects.<\/p><p>I agree with the points made by Senators opposite about voids.  Obviously, this was an issue that needed attention because much of the local authority housing stock was lying vacant or in a derelict state while people languished on housing lists.  That is just not acceptable.  Funding for local authorities was prioritised to enable them to refurbish voids as quickly as possible.  The figures in this regard are available from the Department.  Some local authorities are excellent in dealing with voids, but others are woeful.  Some view their housing stock as an asset to be managed and when it is unused, they invest in it and turn around units as quickly as possible, but others leave houses empty for months, if not years.  That is not good enough and those local authorities that do not come up to the mark should be held to account by councillors and Members of this House in order that those on housing lists can be better served.  <\/p><p>I draw the Minister's attention to a number of issues.  First, I believe we should prioritise the quick-wins, voids being the obvious one.  Existing stock must be turned around quickly and put back into use as soon as possible.  Urban regeneration is also very important because the required infrastructure is already in place in urban areas.  While it is welcome that the &euro;200 million fund has been put in place by the Government for critical infrastructure, I point to the many cities, towns and villages in which existing full serviced housing stock is lying derelict and vacant.  We need to provide incentives to unlock the potential of these sites and get the owners to either sell or let them.  That would increase footfall in the centre of towns and villages all over the country.  That would be a quick-win solution and a cross-cutting departmental response will be required to make it happen.  I know for a fact that the Department cannot do it on its own.  It will need help from the Department of Finance and several others.  <\/p><p>Part V obligations and the viability of construction are huge barriers to supply.  Builders tell us that they are finding it very difficult to access credit and if they cannot do so, they cannot build.  We can talk all we like in this House about the matter, but unless we can find sources of credit for builders, we will not see enough houses being built.  The local authorities have been provided with funding and set on the path, but they must be held to account if they fail to deliver.  In order to reduce the overhead costs associated with delivery, the last Government reduced the Part V obligations - from 20% to 10% - which exposed it to some criticism and it will be interesting to see how many housing units are provided under the new regime.  Unfortunately, for a number of years a Fianna F&aacute;il Government accepted cash from developers in lieu of housing units under the Part V arrangements.  Had that not been the case, we would have 10,000 more social housing units in the system today.  That measure was simply wrong and when I was in office, I removed that mechanism, with the result that developers are now obliged to provide social housing units under Part V, which is the way it should be.<\/p><p>During the boom years a lot of money was collected by the local authorities under Part V arrangements.  That money was supposed to be ring-fenced for reinvestment in housing, whether by way of the maintenance of existing stock or through new builds, but it appears from the figures for voids and new builds that there was very little activity in that regard.  I want to know what happened to the Part V money collected by every local authority.  I suspect some have invested it in housing, but that others are sitting on it, even to this day.  This matter should be examined very closely to determine the level of funding available under the Part V arrangements which can now be used to purchase sites and build new housing developments.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well in his role, but there is no easy answer to this problem which requires a cross-departmental, cross-societal response.  We all have a responsibility.  It is not just about throwing money at the problem but also about finding efficient ways to deliver housing quickly.  I urge the Minister to tell the local authorities to look again at towns and villages which contain derelict houses and vacant sites, in respect of some of which planning permission has been granted, instead of focusing on greenfield sites.  There is a far more efficient way to deliver housing.  I will certainly be putting my shoulder to the wheel in whatever way I can to assist the Minister and every other Senator will do the same.  This is a national problem that crosses politics and political parties and it behoves us all to respond in a responsible way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his elevation today to his distinguished position.<\/p> <p>It is an indication of the relevance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that on our first real working day we confront one of the major social issues facing the country.

I have just looked at the figures for those who have accessed homeless services in Dublin in the past two years.  In 2014 the figure was 2,306.  It has almost doubled to 3,777 this year.  That gives real cause for worry - the constant incremental increase.  We also know that in 2014 there were 20,000 people on the housing list in the Dublin City Council area.  I assume there are considerably more than on it now.  <\/p> <p>I wish to talk a little about the banks.  We have had banks putting people out on the side of the road.  It is an increasing phenomenon and the Government appeared to endorse the policy.  I remind the banks that they were rescued with money from the purses of the ordinary, small people of this country.  It was our money, but now they are turning around and putting people out of their houses.  It is disgraceful.  <\/p> <p>One of the most fundamental rights in any decent democratic society is the right to housing, shelter and a home.  We now see NAMA and others selling off mortgage portfolios to vulture funds.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are people who will be utterly callous.  They just kick people out on the side of the street.  Why was it not found possible to offer those mortgages to their original proprietors at the discount at which they were sold to the vulture funds?  That would have kept people in their homes and would have been the decent thing to do.  Now we have people in hotels.  That might sound very grand - as though it would be nice to be in a hotel.  I do not think it is very nice.  They are stuck in unsuitable accommodation and are very often told they cannot go in the front door but must go around to the tradesman's entrance at the back.  They are second-class citizens.  The children are not allowed to play and there are no facilities for them.  If one looks at the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin, for example, on the night of 24 April this year there were 102 people counted as sleeping rough.  There were certainly more than that.  Over the years, the gender breakdown shows that between 84% and 91% of these are men, mostly young men.  Behind this is a whole nexus of poverty.<br\/><br\/>We have seen over the past ten years the biggest transfer of money from the poor to the rich that I have ever experienced in my life.  We have a situation involving various definitions of poverty.  We have the consistent poverty rates.  &quot;Consistent poverty&quot; describes the situation of people whose income is below the poverty threshold and who cannot afford at least two of 11 staple items, which I will come back to in a minute.  The at-risk-of-poverty threshold is an income of &euro;10,926 - that is, just &euro;11,000.  That is about the level of the contributory old age pension.  There are 11 deprivation indicators: two pairs of strong shoes - anybody could see it is real poverty if one is not able to afford a pair of weatherproof shoes - a warm, waterproof overcoat; buying new, not second-hand clothes; eating meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian equivalent every second day; having a roast joint or its equivalent once a week; having to go without heating in the last year through lack of money; keeping the home adequately warm; buying presents for family or friends at least once a year; replacing any worn-out furniture; having family or friends for a drink or a meal once a month; and having had a morning, afternoon or evening out in the last fortnight for entertainment.  These are the qualities that give people a human life.  It provides not just for decent clothing, shelter and food but also for some degree of human dignity in terms of provision for entertainment.  The percentage of Irish people living in consistent poverty in 2014 was 8%.  That has nearly doubled from 4.2% in 2008.  The consistent poverty rate for the unemployed is 22.6%, which is up from 9.7%, so it has more than doubled in those four or five years.  Children remain the most vulnerable age group, with 11.2% living in consistent poverty.  It is particularly marked in single-parent households.<br\/><br\/>The percentage of people who are at risk of poverty was 14.1% in 2013, which was the seventh lowest in the EU.  It is very easy to trick around with these figures and say we are doing pretty well because we are the seventh lowest in the EU.  Being at risk of poverty is to live on an income below 60% of the median income.  If one looks behind those figures and if one takes away the social welfare payments and various things like that, Ireland's position falls: the actual at-risk rate in this country without social welfare supports would be a staggering 49.8%.  In other words, without the support of social welfare, nearly half the people of this country would be at risk of poverty.  That is a salutary figure that ought to bring us up short.  Consistent poverty rates have increased over the years because of the financial difficulties this country found itself in, and in 2014 it was estimated that just 370,000 people were in this category.  This is in a society with a very high cost of living.  Prices in the Republic were 22.3% above the European average in 2014, making the State the joint third most expensive place in the EU, and we have these levels of poverty.<br\/><br\/>In the midst of this, we have 140,000 children in this country at risk of poverty.  That puts into context all the bleating about treating all the children of the nation equally.  Fergus Finlay, the chief executive of Barnardos, who is well known to this House, has said the child poverty rate is &quot;a national scandal&quot;.  He has said:<\/p><blockquote>We would expect to have seen the beginnings of a reduction in child poverty rates in 2014 [...]  However one in nine children still live in consistent poverty and more than a third of children experience deprivation, while the number of children at risk of poverty has not improved since 2010.  This puts paid to the rhetoric that &lsquo;a rising tide will lift all boats&rsquo; [...] two children in every classroom are living without access to basic necessities through no fault of their own or their parents.  They are going without warm winter clothing, living in substandard housing and even going hungry.<\/blockquote><p>What condition are those children in to absorb the lessons of education?<br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to the sponsors of this motion.  It is a very good motion.  I hope agreement can be reached so that Seanad &Eacute;ireann puts its muscle, its back and its united effort behind those Ministers seeking to address this most urgent problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#AAA00700","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I wish the Leas-Chathaoirleach well in his role.

Doorstep after doorstep in Dublin provides unacceptable accommodation for people who are living at the margins of society.  This worthwhile motion is very welcome.  We can work together across all parties to try to sort out the homelessness crisis.  Outside the large cities, homelessness may not be as visible, but it is no less a challenge for those who want their own homes but have to rely on the couches or floors of family and friends or emergency accommodation.  Much human despair is unfolding every day for families.  We have also heard worrying reports of homeless children being accommodated on blow-up beds in adult hostels.  How did it come to this?<\/p> <p>Ten years ago we had housing estates being built.  When I was on the local authority, I felt the apartments or housing were of a great standard.  We felt we had addressed the housing crisis, although there was no crisis then.  One of the reasons is that there were many buy-to-let investors who were involved in business and decided they would buy apartments to let.  I was probably one of them.  However, many of them have now lost their properties because of the downturn.  I see many buildings for sale that are vacant for three or four years because the owners are still trying to deal with the banks.  That is no good to the homeless who want a place to live.  There is an issue with many of the banks, which have been very slow to get these properties sold to local authorities to ensure people can move into them.<\/p> <p>We talk about ghost estates.  We think of these as estates that were built in the past five or ten years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To me the new ghost estates in my own town are places such as Marian Road - so-called because it was built in the 1950s and 1960s.  Most of the people from such areas - which I would call quite good housing stock - moved to newer estates.  The ghost estates now are the local authority estates that were allowed to deteriorate when most of the families moved out.  The local authorities should have done much more work to address this issue.  It is very good-quality accommodation, as we are all aware from canvassing.  We go into the old traditional estates that I canvassed 16 years ago, and there is nobody living in them now.  These were quite good houses.  There is a need for joined-up thinking, and I know the Minister will do this.  That is where a lot of the work is being done.  I am pleased that the D&aacute;il agreed to establish a special Committee on Housing and Homelessness to review the implications of the problem of housing and homelessness and to make recommendations.  I believe these recommendations are logical.<\/p><p>On the main street in Boyle, Bridge Street, where 150 people grew up 40 years ago, I think my mother is the only person living over the shop.  There is high-quality accommodation in every town and village.  I speak of a small area in County Roscommon; it is not the same as in Dublin.  Even around Dublin, over shops, there is high-quality accommodation.  There is a need for some type of incentive to encourage people to live over the shop or to live in the towns and villages again.  We cannot have a situation akin to that in the US, where there was a quick exodus to the suburbs.  The suburbs were nice and they were great, but there is a need to reinvent the towns.  As a person who grew up over a shop - we did not even have a back door - I was very happy, and I still live there.  Could one raise a family there?  It may not be acceptable today, but many families were raised over shops years ago.  The fact is that there are people who are homeless, and we need to do something about that.<\/p><p>The scale of the housing construction challenge is huge.  Recently, local authorities estimated that more than &euro;1 billion per year is needed over the next five years to address the social housing shortage across the country.  A capital funding commitment is a major challenge, but it is not about money - it is about joined up thinking, such as the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  In this Chamber we can work together to try to ensure we sort out this issue.<\/p><p>The banks have much to answer for because they have been slow to wash out many of the properties that should be opened up immediately for housing.  I have seen apartments empty for four or five years.  On the question of allowing somebody in for nothing, the local authorities have been slow to address that situation.  <\/p><p>In regard to the emergency measures to tackle the crisis, much more needs to be done.  There is a need to build approximately 30,000 to 35,000 houses to make up for the lack of building during the past five years.  It is an issue of which we lost sight, and it crept up.  It was a perfect storm, although that is no good to the people who are living on sofas or in hotel rooms.  As a Government, I do not believe we will oppose the motion.  Hopefully, this is the new politics - the cross-party politics where we can accept motions and work together to try to alleviate the problem of homelessness.  In two years' time we will have another issue, but I hope it will not be homelessness.  <\/p><p>I commend the Senator for bringing the motion to the House and I support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#BBB00400","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>After &quot;calls for:&quot;, to insert:&quot;- the Government to declare a state of emergency to recognise the scale of the housing crisis and to:<blockquote>- double investment in social housing;<br \/><br \/>- fast track the approval, procurement and tendering process for local authorities;<br \/><br \/>- introduce rent certainty, linking rent to the consumer price index;<br \/><br \/>- legislate for a moratorium on home repossessions until adequate measures to deal with mortgage distress are enacted; and<br \/><br \/>- introduce emergency legislation to give tenants in private rental properties greater protections when properties are bought by vulturefunds.&quot; <\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeachas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach as ucht a cheapach&aacute;n.

Of course, Fine Gael will support it; it has no choice, as it does not have the numbers to oppose it.  There is an element of brass neck from Fianna F&aacute;il in coming forward with such a motion today, when it was the architect of the disastrous situation we find in the housing sector in Ireland.  For five years in Government, Fine Gael continued the broken policies.  To say it had not realised there was an issue or that it crept up on us is astounding coming from a Fine Gael Member, because we certainly raised those issues time after time in the Houses with all the Deputies and Ministers who came forward.<\/p><p>We have tabled an amendment because the motion simply does not go far enough.  We are calling on the Government to declare a state of emergency, as it is more than a crisis.  We are asking the Government to declare a state of emergency, admit how bad the issue is and recognise the scale of the housing crisis.  We are calling on it to double investment in social housing, to fast track the approval, procurement and tendering process for local authorities, to introduce rent certainty, linking rent to the consumer price index, to legislate for a moratorium on home repossessions until adequate measures to deal with mortgage distress are enacted, and to introduce emergency legislation to give tenants in private rental properties greater protections when properties are bought by vulture funds.  We hope there will not be a vote because we hope all Members will accept the amendment, but we will certainly push the amendment to a vote later.<\/p><p>At the latest count by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, there were almost 6,000 homeless people in Ireland, including 2,000 children.  The most recent figures for the number of homeless children in Dublin show that there were 1,723, in 839 families.  The recent Housing Agency report for the Government put the number of vacant homes across the State as high as 230,000 and included a vacant home tax among its recommendations.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Minister to take action immediately, because there may be as many as 230,000 vacant homes across the State.  I am informed that in Dublin there are 255 vacant units.  There is no point in talking about the issue; these have to be turned into homes for families.  <\/p><p>There are up 130,000 households on local authority housing waiting lists, including well over 10,000 in Galway as we speak.  Rents and house prices are spiralling out of control.  It is simply not good enough for the Government to sit on its hands and do nothing about vacant properties when so many families are in severe housing need.  We have been told repeatedly by the Government that the central cause of the housing crisis is an undersupply of housing, particularly private housing, yet the Housing Agency has prepared a report for the Government which includes a mention of empty houses.  This does not include holiday homes.  We want to see these empty houses turned into homes for families. <\/p><p>There has been a little talk about repossessions.  Last month I decided to go to the repossessions court in Galway to see it with my own two eyes.  What is going on there is an absolute disgrace.  I had a misconception that many of the people in the repossessions court had totally defaulted on their mortgages, but the opposite is the truth.  In many cases, banks and vulture capitalists are chasing people for a couple of thousand euro.  These are people who are maintaining a certain level of payment - a substantial amount, in many cases - and who have paid hundreds of thousands of euro towards their mortgages over a number of years, so it is not the case that those in the repossessions courts are total and utter defaulters who do not want to pay their debts back.  There are vulture funds in a land grab to take the houses from people who have very little debt left to repay.  It is an absolute scandal.  Even the set-up of these courts is an absolute scandal.  Cases are not heard by a judge.  The court in Galway is tiny.  I counted 21 seats, nine of which were taken up by solicitors and barristers.  The others were taken up by people from NGOs and agencies supporting people in distress.  Most of the people who had hearings could not get into the courtroom.  They had to queue in the corridor and down the stairs in Galway courthouse, which is an absolute disgrace.  That issue needs to be addressed.  They could not get a proper hearing.  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in calls for legislation to give tenants rent certainty.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I again put it to Fianna F&aacute;il that if it is so serious about this crisis, it should support the Bill going through the D&aacute;il today, and I say this to all others present as well.<\/p><p>Rents across the State continue to rise as the watered-down rent certainty measures introduced last year by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, failed to make any dent in the rental prices.  I believe Galway witnessed the highest increases in rents over the past quarter and numerous reports have illustrated this fact.  The recent quarterly rental report showed an increase in the average rent nationwide of 9.3% in the year to March 2016, with average rents now at a rate of more than &euro;1,000 per month.  In Dublin, the report showed rental inflation for the year to March at 8.8% and that it costs an average of &euro;1,663 per month to rent in parts of the city.  It also demonstrated that nationally, rents were 8.6% higher in the first three months of 2016 than in the same period last year.  Galway definitely has a perfect storm in this regard because it has a huge student population, as well as a number of reasonably affluent companies and consequently, people who come to work for those companies are taking up a lot of the better private accommodation.  In addition, Galway has rent caps that do not recognise the cost of rented houses in the rental market and a new phenomenon has emerged in Galway.  I attended the briefing held yesterday by the Society of St. Vincent De Paul and raised the issue of the hidden homeless because I wished to ascertain what was the society's experience in this regard.  There is a whole cohort of people who are couch-surfing.  I am aware of many single parents in particular who are staying with their children in the homes of friends or family, including sisters or brothers.  While some might state they are lucky to have relatives to look after them, and they are, but the stress this puts on those situations is unbelievable.  These people have the right to their own home and a right to proper accommodation and to their own space.  It is causing mental health issues and great stress and is putting huge pressure on all the families involved.  This issue of hidden homeless also must be addressed.<\/p><p>I also visited the refuge for homeless women in Galway recently, Osterley Lodge, where the waiting list is simply incredible.  Accommodation is not available for women who may be in abusive situations, particularly due to domestic violence.  They have absolutely nowhere to go and service providers such as COPE Galway simply cannot control what is going on.  It is time for Senators to put their money where their mouths are.  If this is the new politics, Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a progressive amendment to this motion.  If Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to prove it really is reinventing itself, this is the time to show Members what it intends to do.  One must remember that Fianna F&aacute;il has the control here, in that it has the balance of power.  Its Members can force through any of these measures because Fine Gael must come on board to get the majority to put through any measure.  I am calling on and putting it up to Fianna F&aacute;il Members to make sure these measures in the amendment are included, after which Members together will push collectively the Government to deliver on the promises I hope all Members will make in the Seanad this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#CCC00300","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I second the amendment and will divide my few words into two parts.  I first wish to talk about child poverty.  Members are aware that poverty and the hardship caused by poverty and social exclusion are not new phenomena.  They are aware that in 2010, under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, more than 200,000 children lived in households experiencing poverty.  Moreover, the number of children at risk of poverty rose by more than 35,000 in the three years between 2007 and 2010.  One major disservice and wrong done by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2008 was to get rid of the Combat Poverty Agency.  It was the only agency dedicated to addressing poverty and because the Government did not like what it had to say - it was saying exactly what Members are saying in the Chamber today - it axed the agency.  Had the Combat Poverty Agency been listened to at that time, an awful lot would have been learned because it had the information and evidence available for Members to formulate policies that would have prevented the crisis we face today.<\/p> <p>Child poverty cannot be addressed in isolation, but must be considered within the wider issues of poverty and all households must be lifted out of poverty by Government policies and joined-up thinking.  I am not simply talking about properly-paid employment but about essential public services such as access to health services, equal access to education and a level playing field.  In particular, I refer to a level playing field for children who are living in homes that are not conducive to their full participation in either the education system or society because of what they are going through.  As a nation, we have failed to address poverty and social exclusion.  Even when this country was awash with money, we gave more to the rich and we robbed the poor.  The protection of the golden circle was more important than keeping open community development projects, homework clubs or projects that addressed social exclusion and addiction or which helped poor mental health and many other social issues.  Eight successive cuts were imposed on lone parents alone and the price now is being paid for the failure of successive Governments to invest in families and communities.  Many of the young people who now are shooting and being shot all over this city and in other cities were children who grew up in communities that were crying out for investment and attention and we have failed them.  As Senator Norris observed earlier, a rising tide does not lift all boats and targeted comprehensive interventions are needed to tackle the injustice of poverty in all its forms.<\/p> <p>In respect of housing specifically, it is scandalous that thousands of units are left vacant by local authorities.  However, from my time as a member of Mayo County Council, I am aware that local authorities are starved of resources and when they do get some money, the manner in which it can be spent is highly restrictive.  I ask the Minister of State to address this point.  Local authorities must have autonomy on where money can be spent and how it can best be used, rather than it being purely prescriptive because local authorities and the Government are among the most reckless landlords in the State.  I know of people who have been renting council houses for 30 years and more but who are without central heating or insulation and whose windows and doors have not been replaced throughout that time.  However, they are being asked to pay rent and to live in these conditions, which is not right.  Even though money was available last year, which I welcome, this money cannot be spent on the refurbishment of the local authority stock or if it can, the local authorities certainly are unaware of that.  Consequently, I call for immediate investment into the existing local authority stock.<\/p> <p>However, as the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment stated, an emergency response is needed.  Local authorities must be able to buy private houses, as well as those that are available through the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The procurement process is holding everything up and the Government is aware it can announce however many millions of euro for housing in the next week or ten days in the full knowledge that this money cannot be spent because of the restrictions and delays in procurement.  There also is another issue in that because of the moratorium, there is not a sufficient number of housing officers within local authorities to be able to prepare the procurement papers and everything that must be done to fast-track that.  Local authorities must be allowed to have a response and the response by the local authority in Mayo may be different from the response needed from Dublin.  Many vacant private units in County Mayo could be brought up within weeks and used as social housing and I suggest this be done rather than building new homes.  In addition, this obviously would serve both rural and urban regeneration whereby families then would be living in those communities, which is badly needed to keep open the schools, post offices and everything else in rural areas.<\/p> <p>I wish to comment on the housing assistance payment because rental limits are forcing families to break the law by lying about rent.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister says time and again that there is flexibility around rent limits and what can be paid in different areas.  I categorically refute that.  Mayo County Council is not one of the local authorities given the flexibility to do that so if a tenant needs a home, they must say they are paying a certain amount in rent and go with that in the fear that they may be found out and have to pay back all that money to the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>I will finish with the issue of repossessions because I attended the court in Castlebar last Monday.  Like Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, I saw how families are being put out of their homes.  One incident backed up what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said.  The housing debt was &euro;66,000.  Last January, somebody offered to pay &euro;50,000 on behalf of the family and the bank refused to take it.  Where is the write-down and the discretion?  Where is the cut-off for families after all we have done for the banks and how the banks have been supported?  There is a major loss of revenue to the Government in respect of deals given to vulture funds.  It is not only the haircuts; it is the loss of revenue where these vulture funds, which are based abroad, do not have pay VAT.  There is drainage from the State.  That money could be put towards housing.<\/p><p>The Minister might consider training for housing officers on the dynamics of domestic violence because very many of them do not understand these dynamics.  They need to remove the barriers in order that it is easier for women and children living in horrific conditions to escape from violent homes.  I ask the Minister to support the amendment because while I have no problem with the Fianna F&aacute;il motion, the amendment is more comprehensive in respect of what we are trying to address here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#DDD00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  It is important that we look at where we are in respect of housing.  Yes, we have problems and there are many measures that can be taken immediately to resolve some of them.  I will give the Minister a simple example that relates to downsizing.  Quite a number of my constituents who occupy three or four-bedroom houses have told me that they have been contacting their local authority for four, five or, in some cases, eight years looking to move to a one or two-bedroom unit that is more suitable because they have moved on in years and need to be near shops and services.  There are suitable units available for them but they find there is no response from the local authorities.  They are occupying three or four-bedroom houses that would be suitable for families.  I am astonished.  If one goes to other areas, be they in the private or public sector, there is a much faster response in respect of dealing with issues.  This is one area where local authorities could react immediately.  I know of at least six houses in one local authority area that would be very suitable for families.<\/p> <p>I do not understand why it can take up to two years to bring a vacant house back into use.  I am talking about houses that are handed back after a person has died.  There seems to be a huge delay.  I understand that some local authorities will send out a different person to look at the house and one could find at least six to seven different people going out to look at a house regardless of whether it is the plumber, electrician or the person who will look at the windows.  Why can local authorities not set up a team that would go out on the same day and carry out an assessment of what needs to be done?  I know of one local authority where the keys are handed back to the housing department, the housing department then sends them down to the electrician or plumber to go out, it takes another six weeks for the keys to come back to the housing department, they are then sent out to another person to go and look at the house and it takes another six weeks.  It seems to go on and on.  Surely in this day and age, we could co-ordinate house inspections and how this matter can be managed to ensure the house is brought back into use at a very early stage.  Somebody contacted me last week who surrendered their house to a local authority because they had entered a new relationship and moved in with their new partner in another area of the city.  Unfortunately, the relationship did not work out and the person contacted me to find out whether they could move back into their old local authority house.  I told them that I did not think the house would be vacant to be told that it was and that all the shutters were up 18 months later.  This raises very serious questions.  At a time when we badly need houses, we are not responding in time.<\/p> <p>Some of my colleagues have raised the issue of how we manage finances.  We are paying out money in social welfare and rightly so because we need to give supports to people regardless of whether they are retired or on various allowances such as disability allowance.  However, we are paying out &euro;20 billion per annum, which works out at &euro;57 million per day.  I do not like the impression that is created that the State is not giving the necessary support.  Yes, there are areas where not all the supports that exist cater for some people, but in fairness to the State, we pay out &euro;57 million per day in social welfare.  It is about ensuring people who fall between the two stools because they do not qualify for the various supports are identified and dealt with.  Likewise, we must ensure housing support is provided to people who require it.<\/p> <p>When one looks back over the past 20 years, a scheme once operated under which if someone put money on deposit, another 25% was added to it over a period at a time when we were getting a huge amount of money in from housing.  If one looks back to before 2008, it is sad to see how little of the money coming in between PRSI paid in respect of people working for building contractors, VAT paid by building contractors, capital gains tax and stamp duty was used at the time to provide local authority housing when we needed it.  It is always difficult to say that we will rely totally on the private sector because that is exactly what happened.  It was fine relying on the private sector when there was an oversupply of housing but that suddenly changed.  When the Government changed in 2011, there was an oversupply of housing at that stage.  This has changed in the past two years.<\/p> <p>We also need to look at structures relating to housing, for example, how letting in the private sector is short-term.  In other European countries, one can get a 20-year lease and the same is true if one is in the commercial sector.  Someone renting a shop unit or office can get a 20-year lease with five-year rent reviews.  They are then obliged to fit out their own offices so they are not relying on the landlord.  We need to look at arrangements in other European countries for people who cannot afford to buy a house but who want certainty and permanency.  They are able to save some money and invest in a property.  In Germany, a person renting a property carries out all the internal work in a property such as putting in the fitted kitchen, bathroom, curtains and flooring, but they have a very low rent for 20 years so they have certainty and security of tenure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They also have far lower costs in terms of wear and tear compared to our system.

We need to develop a structure very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#EEE00200","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I wish to share four minutes of my time with Senators Ruane and Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

There are some very positive measures we would welcome.  We welcome that one of the first debates in the House highlights and focuses on such a vital, important and crucial issue.  The motion and supplementary amendments that have been proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il offer very constructive and positive measures.  I and, I believe, many others in our group would be very interested in driving forward an all-party consensus and in moving forward together in terms of highlighting these issues.  That is something we can do constructively.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight a number of issues.  The figures on deprivation in Ireland are shocking.  Deprivation involves not just poverty in terms of income but a lack of any form of safety net, security or capital reserve.  Deprivation means the lack of means to purchase the basic necessities of life.  That puts into very stark contrast those who want to manage housing in terms of day-to-day spending.  I welcome the specific acknowledgement of the very shocking deprivation levels affecting lone parents in Ireland.  One-parent families are a cause of concern in terms of the deprivation levels that exist.<\/p><p>I refer to housing and homelessness.  While it is important that we highlight the large numbers of people on housing waiting lists, we must also be aware of the large number of hidden homeless.  Some previous speakers focused on those who are staying in unsafe and unsuitable situations, particularly people who are dealing with issues such as domestic violence, because of a lack of appropriate housing and the fear of entering what is now seen to be a long and desperate journey to obtain housing or alternative housing, which may involve bringing children into unsuitable situations.<\/p><p>In addition to some of the measures that have been mentioned, which focus largely on emergency measures and initial action, I hope the House may also address the crucial medium-term housing issues which must be considered.  Another Senator<b><\/b>spoke of leasing.  An over-reliance on the use of leases at local level, which results in a block on the opportunity for local authorities to purchase sustainable housing, means that children who are enrolled in schools have no guarantee that in three or five years' time a landlord will not move them out of their current accommodation.  A short-term solution offering five or ten-year leases would leave many children disturbed in the middle of their schooling.  Such an approach would affect jobs, etc., and would require families to reroute and reorient themselves after a period of homelessness.  Such families will again be thrown into vulnerable situations.  We have seen this happen on a case-by-case basis throughout the country.  In terms of medium-term measures, I urge the State to build or buy rather than lease housing units.<\/p><p>Another medium-term danger is the capital gains tax waiver which was in place in 2013 and 2014.  In effect, it was an invitation to vulture funds to enter Ireland.  We must now address the concerns of those who are renting properties from vulture funds.  We have seen the need for such people to be given urgent protection.  In three or four years' time, when the vulture funds are able to withdraw from Ireland without paying tax thanks to the seven-year condition that was applied to their purchases, we may face a further crisis.<\/p><p>Another speaker said that this matter is not about money.  It is about money.  We need to say that we value direct investment in housing and are willing to put it on the books - it does not need to be off-balance sheet.  A cost-benefit analysis of the recent reduction in inheritance tax might be a more worthy exercise than considering the comparable cost and benefit of investing in secure homes for families across Ireland in the long term.  I urge us to move past the no-cost approach to a more dynamic long-term investment approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>A couple of Senators referred to the hidden homeless.  Last year I was with a young man in hospital when he died.  We tried to encourage him to undergo treatment for cirrhosis of the liver.  The man was aged in his early 30s and lived in a hostel.  He chose to die in a hospital bed rather than have to live on the streets again.  His fear was that if he went into treatment he would lose his place in a hostel, and instead chose to die.  I assured him that I would work with him until we secured accommodation for him in order to ensure he could go into treatment.  His view was that it did not matter because he was part of the forgotten homeless.  That experience stayed with me.  It is part of the new wave of homelessness that is happening and that affects families and local authorities.  Another cohort of homelessness comprises those with high levels of need.<\/p> <p>In the hostels I have worked in there are men who require nursing home care.  The staff in hostels are not nurses, but they act as medical professionals.  The current levels of primary care and safety nets for homeless people are increasing their life expectancy.  Investment is not being provided to ensure that hostels keep up with the men and women - mostly men - who are reaching an age where they should be in nursing homes.  Some of them have high levels of care needs but are being cared for by project workers who are not suitably qualified.  They are not being allowed to die with dignity.  The hostels are of a low standard.  Street drinkers live in them.  Even when people die in hostels, they do not do so in the comfort of a bed where they should be at their age.<\/p> <p>I recently visited Br&uacute; Aimsir hostel to carry out a survey.  I welcome that the process will continue and the hostel will increase to full capacity.  I call on the Minister and anyone else who is dealing with the homelessness issue not to forget that a cohort of homeless people is not acknowledged in any legislation.  Council housing is not appropriate for such people.  Rather, they need supportive and traditional housing with structures that allow those with high levels of needs to be cared for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Senator Kelleher has about ten seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00600","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00700","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>My experience with sharing time is that nobody ever keeps their time, which has a knock-on effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00800","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I am happy to share two minutes of my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#FFF00900","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Okay.

I was elected to Dublin City Council in 1999.  One of the very early arguments we had was about housing in the city and the provision of social housing in particular.  At that stage the city management, to a great extent, had made the decision, along with many other local authorities, to move away from the social housing model and allow the private sector to provide social housing, that is, rented, and that the voluntary housing groups would move in to provide that housing.  I found that situation unsatisfactory at the time and argued wholeheartedly against it.  Unfortunately, I won the argument and lost the war because in principle it was accepted that local authorities would stay involved in the provision of social housing but they never furthered the implementation of that.<\/p> <p>Part V has been discussed in the House on many occasions and it was a very progressive idea that 20% of housing built would be affordable and social housing.  That idea came from public representatives and community groups in the north and south docklands in Dublin city.  In fairness, we had a very enlightened Minister for the Environment and Local Government at the time,  the former Deputy Noel Dempsey, who took the idea on board and legislated for it.  If that legislation had stayed as intended in the legislation right through the boom years when we saw massive building in the city, we would have got that 20% social and affordable housing.  Unfortunately, the Minister was not to stay long enough to see it grow and flourish, and the succeeding Minister, former Deputy Martin Cullen, changed the legislation which allowed the huge building spree within the city without a provision for social housing.  He gave exemptions in the planning permissions compared with those provided by the preceding Minister, the former Deputy Dempsey.<\/p> <p>It is great to have this debate and discussion and there are many elements of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment which I would support, especially relating to the consumer.  Linking rents to the consumer price index is one of the things we fought for within Government but unfortunately were not able to deliver.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on putting that on board.<\/p> <p>I hope that when the Minister returns with his response, he may be able to update us on the provision of the 500 modular housing units.  It is very important that they would be delivered on time in order that people can start moving out from the unsatisfactory situation of living in hotel rooms.<\/p> <p>I put it to the Minister of State that there are many dangers facing us.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, met councillors from Dublin City Council on Monday night to listen to their concerns about housing issues in Dublin.  It is very important that the Minister would visit as many local authorities.  Councillors are working on the ground, they have solutions that can be implemented, and they can often be pragmatic.<\/p> <p>However, we must also watch out for new dangers that might arise.  Independent Councillor Mannix Flynn and Sinn F&eacute;in Councillor Daith&iacute; Doolan, the chair of the city council's strategic policy committee on housing, are highlighting issues that affect not just Dublin but also other European capital cities and American cities.  There is a phenomenon currently of renting homes, for example, through Airbnb and other such companies.  There are approximately 1,700 units for rent in Dublin.  I am concentrating on Dublin in this issue, because while the situation is also very urgent in Cork, Mayo and other counties and cities, the major crisis in homelessness at the moment is in Dublin.  There are 1,700 units advertised between various websites, from apartments to homes for rent, and I believe this is a high percentage of the rental units available to families.  These units can make a lot more money if they follow the Airbnb model.  One two-bedroom apartment in the centre of Dublin city was able to make &euro;79,000 per annum.  Why would a landlord who owns a one or two-bedroom apartment not place that unit on one of those Internet rental sites?  There may be a few extra service and management charges but the profits of renting to tourists are vastly greater than renting to families who live here.  We need to keep a weather eye on that.<\/p> <p>Seattle in Washington state has already moved to bring in legislation, San Francisco is currently reviewing the situation and Amsterdam has brought in legislation.  Berlin is also going through a major housing crisis and is moving very quickly now to bring in controls and legislation over the tourism rental market.  When we have such a scarcity of units in our capital city, we have to be aware that this phenomenon could have a negative effect, even though there are many positives such as increasing accommodation for tourists and investment.  However, while we are experiencing a particular danger, we need to be acutely aware of the situation.  We cannot afford to lose 1,700 units from the market in such a very fast-moving area.<\/p> <p>During the formation of the Government and the negotiations between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, one of the agreements was that rent supplement would be increased by 15%.  I urge necessary caution with regard to that increase because the figures I have seen in the Department show that a 15% increase in rent supplement would cost approximately &euro;56 million and would generate slightly in excess of 100 units.  Most of that money would go straight to landlords.  It would be better spent on providing built accommodation.  The uplift from the current protocols is between 20% and 30%, or &euro;220.  I fear that the Minister's negotiating team of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il were misguided.  Their intentions may have been correct to suggest additional funding for rent supplement, but the Minister must be very cautious that he is not just putting in a subsidy for landlords instead of increasing additional units.  A blanket increase of 15% would just go to landlords and would not create the additional units we all want.  There is a real and urgent need to ensure the protocol continues.  Reference was made to its operation in Mayo up to two months ago when it is in fact in operation in Mayo and people are accessing it.  The protocol is operational throughout the country unless that has changed since.  I would be concerned about that.  I would be very grateful if the Minister of State could update us on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#GGG00800","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has a maximum of 15 minutes.

It is important that we have this debate and I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling the motion, with which we agree and that we accept, but I do not agree with all of Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment.<\/p> <p>It is important that this House has the chance to discuss the housing situation and the effects it has on the children and their families in emergency accommodation and the solutions to the problem.  I am conscious that the Seanad was not formed in time for Senators to be part of the committee that has been debating the issue in recent weeks, which will produce its much awaited report on Friday that will feed into the action plan for housing.  In addition to today's debate perhaps the Seanad could find a mechanism to discuss the issue further before we finalise the action plan for housing.  As I said this morning when I spoke at a conference, the only way to solve the housing situation is by all of us working together and coming up with ideas.  We might not agree with all the ideas but we need to put them all on the table, talk through them and pick out the best ones.  That is what we will do with the action plan for housing, which will be published in July.  It will set out the stall for what we hope to do over the next six months, 12 months and two years to tackle the emergency situation and to bring about the changes we need to fast-track planning and social housing provision.<\/p> <p>The Seanad might find more time to debate the issue.  I will meet with anybody who has ideas and solutions to tackle the issue and I will talk through them as best I can.  I was involved in the Action Plan for Jobs and the success of the plan was based on stakeholder engagement and for everyone to have a chance to put forward actions and for us to follow through with the implementation of the plans.  The same logic will work for housing if we all work together, step by step and action by action to implement the changes we need in order to solve the problem.<\/p> <p>Many of the problems relate to the lack of housing supply.  Reference was made to that by various speakers.  One speaker referred to zoning more land.  I accept that might be required in some areas but the country has the potential to develop 400,000 housing units on land that is already zoned.  In Dublin alone enough land is zoned to provide 88,000 housing units and enough planning permission has already been granted for 25,000 units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#HHH01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>That is in Dublin but it is important that the Minister of State would take rural areas into account.

It is not just a question of social housing, we need more private housing as well.  There is a considerable under-supply of housing and that is what we must address.  The housing action plan will do that.  For those who are new to the House, we used the same process to address the jobs situation and we created an Action Plan for Jobs.  When it was first published in 2012 everyone laughed at it and said it could not possible achieve what it set out to do.  The target was to create 100,000 jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs exceeded the target and when the private sector is included more than 135,000 jobs were created.  I was nervous about the plan when it was first put together but it did work so I have every confidence that a similar process and action plan for housing will address the problem with the lack of housing.<\/p> <p>All debates such as the one we are having now will feed into the process.  Seanad Members did not get a chance to become part of the housing committee because the Seanad was not constituted at the time but now Members have a chance to discuss the matter in the Seanad, other meetings and through the Department.  We will engage with all.  Plenty of good ideas have been mooted today.  I cannot answer all the questions asked but I will get the information Members need and we will work together on the issues.  We will tease out all the good ideas that have been made.<\/p> <p>I told the House the Leader could run fast so I invite him to do his business.  The motion gives us an opportunity to put on record the Government's commitment to robustly tackling the significant challenges.  I pledge that housing is the No. 1 priority for the Government.  Housing is the first item on the agenda.  We must address the issue as the current situation is not acceptable.  We will address the issue and fix it.  As the Minister of State working with the senior Minister, Deputy Coveney, it is No. 1 on our agenda.  The Department is now called the housing and planning Department and that is what we are about.  That is what we will try to fix with the help of the ideas suggested by Members.  We will work closely with Members.<\/p> <p>We are preparing an action plan for housing that will be published in July at the latest.  It should be ready before July.  The action plan will build on the considerable work already carried out and under way in this area.  It will also draw on the important work carried out by the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which is due to submit its report to the D&aacute;il shortly.  I hope many of the recommendations following the work that was carried out will feed into the action plan as we move forward.<\/p> <p>The plan will include actions to expedite and boost the supply of all types of housing, including social housing, rental accommodation, student accommodation, transient accommodation and all other types of accommodation we need to tackle the issue both in the immediate short term, medium term and long term.  The plan will focus in particular on those experiencing most difficulty in accessing the housing and rental market at the moment.  Many such people are in emergency accommodation, which is not acceptable.  Emergency accommodation is not suitable for the long term and that is one issue we are trying to address.<\/p> <p>Both the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have initiated early engagement with those who have been working in the housing and homelessness area for many years to discuss the broad approach to the action plan.  The Minister is on the record as describing the situation as an \"emergency\", particularly in urban centres.  I agree with him in that regard.  We must and will tackle the emergency.  The housing of families and children in unsuitable emergency accommodation is not right.  It is not sustainable and it is certainly not a solution.  The Government is therefore firm in its determination to take action and to take it urgently.<\/p> <p>In Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the Government set out a child-specific poverty target to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two thirds by 2020.  It is clear that only by adopting a whole-of-government approach can we hope to address the serious challenges posed in meeting that target.  My Department, for its part, is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to deliver on the commitment that every child should be safe and protected from harm with a place to call home.  We could all agree that is a target we must achieve and as quickly as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the house building sector is struggling to get back on its feet.  With the downturn in the economy the sector came to a virtual standstill and that lasted for the best part of a decade both in private housing supply and also in the provision of local authority housing.  We are trying to ramp up capacity again through local authorities in order to build houses so that local authorities can have their own housing stock and not just lease or rent them.  The capacity to do that was completely and utterly done away with in local authorities.  We must rebuild the capacity as quickly as we possibly can.  It has taken longer than we would like but it is happening and we must expedite the process as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>There is also under capacity in the private sector and it is not delivering either.  When I addressed the conference this morning I said that everybody has to play his or her part in order to increase the amount of housing stock.  We must build at least 25,000 houses a year.  In the next couple of years we will probably need 30,000 houses per year.  Last year we built 12,500 houses.  More than half of them were one-off houses outside Dublin.  They were no addition to solving the current crisis in Dublin.  The target we must reach is at least 25,000 houses per year, and we must reach it as quickly as we possibly can.  After we deal with the emergency situation in housing we must then have a sustainable construction sector that will always be in the range of 12% to 14% of GNP, which is what it should be, not at in excess of 26% which is where it was previously or at 6% where it is today, but in the middle.<\/p> <p>I addressed the issue of the availability of land for house building.  Affordability must also be tackled.  We must try to develop houses at a price people can afford because there is no point in developing houses such as some of the 4,000 houses currently in construction that are way out of the price range for most people and will not help us solve our problem so they are not much addition to us.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If people are spending most of their income on mortgages they have a lot less money to meet the many other demands of life.  This affects the real economy and people's quality of life and ability to raise families.  It also puts many working families in more precarious financial positions and at risk of homelessness, which we cannot allow to continue.  The housing situation is, therefore, affecting every sector of Irish society and it is putting at risk our hard-won gains in terms of employment, recovery of competitiveness and the attractiveness of Ireland as a place to work, live and grow a business.  <\/p><p>It is important to recognise that we have made a start in terms of addressing the situation.  A &euro;3.8 billion social housing strategy has been put in place.  The problem is not an availability of funding but our inability to spend that funding quick enough to address the situation.  While additional funding will be required into the future, for now money is being made available to address the situation.  We are also reforming Part V to make delivery of social housing possible and viable, many of which changes Senator Coffey when Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was involved in making.<\/p><p>We are implementing a range of actions on homelessness and putting in place rent certainty measures, thereby giving hard-pressed tenants greater stability pending increased supply coming on-stream.  We are lowering development contributions and putting in place a rebate scheme for housing at more affordable prices, from which Dublin and Cork will benefit.  A vacant site levy is being introduced, although for legal reasons this cannot kick-in until 2019.  However, the threat of its application will progress site development at a quicker pace.  Revision of the departmental guidelines will also help in terms of the Department's work with NAMA and its plan to provide 20,000 new homes.  These are all useful efforts to try to stimulate the housing market.  The Government accepts that this is not enough and that it has not thus far helped to solve the problem.  Simply providing money is not sufficient.  We must drive the spend of that money, work with the local authorities and reform the planning system.  The Part VIII system has been reformed but it needs to be driven further with, perhaps, more changes required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#HHH01400","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The local authorities need to be reformed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>They have been reformed.

Deputy English does not live far from me and I know that he is a hardworking Minister.  He has listened to the proposals put forward today, for which I commend him.  However, there are a number of points with which I take issue, including one made by Senator Coffey.  Having been Minister of State with responsibility for housing for some time, Senator Coffey will be aware that many of the problems that have arisen have nothing to do with money or the position which the then Government found itself in.  The perfect storm was created.  The spatial strategy which was fully implemented deals with only 20% of need indiscriminately across Ireland.  The increase in the cost of build also arose on the watch of the previous Government, 30% of which increase was in regard to regulation and oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ01500","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Incorrect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ01600","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Construction workers continued to be demonised and there is no support for small self-employed builders.  There was also no PRSI net available to builders if they got caught out badly, which many of them did.  These measures and others, such as the 20% deposit, have fed into the housing crisis.  It is not sufficient for us to put our heads in our hands and say the crisis arose because of a lack of money and so on.  All of the measures I have just mentioned have played a part in the development of the crisis.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Coveney, referred on radio to the provision of a &euro;200 million fund for infrastructure and the build of between 15,000 and 20,000 houses over three years.  He then went on to say that this money would not be available until 2017, which was a bit confusing.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy English, would update the House on that matter.  Perhaps I misunderstood what the Minister said, much of which is reported in today's newspapers.  As mentioned earlier by Senator Humphreys, it feels a bit like groundhog day in Punxatawney, with the Government caught in recurring groundhog nightmares.  <\/p> <p>During the election of 2011 we were promised that the lack of social housing would be immediately addressed by the incoming Government.  In 2014, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, promised 35,000 social houses would be built or long-term leased and an additional 75,000 house rentals would be provided.  They are the facts, which is crazy.  We were also told 13,000 new builds would be delivered in 2015.  These figures were off the wall.  What did we get?  How many new social houses were built by 2015?  The answer is 75, although I may be one or two off the mark?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ01700","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>There were 13,000 provided across all schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ01800","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Senator Davitt without interruption please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#JJJ01900","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Senator Coffey is incorrect.

We are looking at a multifaceted approach and there are just a couple of points I would like to make.<\/p> <p>My first point is around the issue of local authorities.  We would expect that the local authorities provide all possible incentives to development, both residential and commercial.  There is a need for that.  However, I understand that in 2013, when Phil Hogan was Minister, guidelines were sent around to every local authority with a request to revise their development contribution schemes, and approximately one third of the 31 local authorities have failed to do so.  In some areas in Mayo - where there had been, say, additional investment in water and sewage infrastructure - one could pay up to &euro;5,000 just for that aspect of one's planning contributions on top of the regular price in other parts of the county.  In the Minister of State's speech, he referred to dealing with the issue of development contributions.  If this circular was sent out to the local authorities and the county manager failed to bring this before councillors for a democratic debate, bearing in mind that these development schemes were set up at the peak of the Celtic tiger era and that, in the case of Mayo, it comes back to the discretion of the manager, that is not any way to do business.  Especially in the likes of Mayo, the cost of development contributions is a deterrent to development and one should not have to go cap in hand to a county manager asking him or her to do this or that.  It should be done in a democratic fashion, and those who are interested in developing should know where they stand, which, in turn, would encourage them.  It is poor that this is the rate, and I would ask that this be taken up with the local authorities that have failed to deal with this to date.<\/p> <p>The other issue is the number of empty premises, particularly in town centres throughout the country.  Much of the emphasis has been on the main housing crisis in the big urban centres, but there are housing problems throughout.  Now that we are addressing these in an ambitious fashion, as the Minister of State described, similar to the Action Plan for Jobs, we must look at the situation of empty buildings in the middle of the market towns.  It is something I have spoken on previously.  Instead of leaving houses that have a lot of architectural value empty when the last person on a street passes away, and nobody goes into the houses - in rural areas, the problem is that people are building further and further out - we need to revitalise, repopulate and give a bit of a boost to small independent traders.  The latter matter must be brought into it, because in talking about sustainable housing one is also talking about sustainable communities.  The whole package must be brought to bear.  There is a problem in that regard the length and breadth of the country, and no matter how good and how much full employment we get, in going into these towns, many of which are market towns, one will get depressed.  I can well see how people would be depressed, because that is what one sees.  When going around knocking on doors, I see it myself.  It is something that we must tackle and have a vision for.<\/p> <p>I would suggest that, rather than having developer-led initiatives as in the past, when sometimes there were incentives for development for which there was no clear market demand, we have a scheme providing for an area in the centre of a town to be zoned in conjunction with the local authority in a holistic approach, such that either an owner-occupier or a first-time buyer would receive either a grant or a tax incentive to buy such a property.  We would be going back to places where people are prepared to live.  When I go to continental Europe and see lovely towns and villages, I often think they are not lovely by accident.  They are lovely because they have had a lot of TLC, a lot of planning and a lot of care.  Then we should follow with amenities for these towns and villages - a playground or whatever else is needed.  Indeed, in the case of rural areas, we should have a vision whereby within a certain radius one can be assured that one will find an ATM and a GP.  Not all of these facilities will be implemented overnight, because there are other factors, including the difficulty of retaining GPs for various reasons.  We have this vision, both urban and rural.  That would be a way to go, and we must also support independent businesses by helping them, as opposed to the large multiples such as Tesco and Lidl, with commercial rates breaks.  The large multiples are a different animal altogether, yet they are all being charged rates pretty much on the same formula.  When one thinks about it, they are a different animal altogether, in terms of the market they control, compared to the small independent traders, which give vitality.  Of course, the vision must mean that we no longer look at small towns and say that we must have corner shops everywhere.  We also must acknowledge that retail has changed.  I am going back to the point about communities.  Housing and communities go together.  Consumers are buying online.  We create a different image and vision, and this is the challenge, through debate, that we have.<\/p> <p>Finally, one of the objectives the Minister of State cited is for people to stay in their own homes.  From my own experience, the practice of mortgage to rent and intervention by the local authority have not been the success that would imagine.  Much more attention could be given to that.  Then one would see benefits, with people able to stay in their own homes.<\/p> <p>One issue that was raised this morning on the Order of Business - the problems of pyrite and mica - comes under the remit of the Minister of State.  For those affected - both in Mayo and in Donegal, although I would be more familiar with Mayo, especially with pyrite in the blocks - we all would like to think we know where this is heading, which is that people will get assistance.  I understand the complexities.  They were overcome in the local authorities here around Dublin and further afield.  I heard about a case a fortnight ago in which the person could not sell their house.  It was when the person came to sell their house that the survey revealed the problem.  I have heard of a couple of cases in which people could not afford to retain structural engineers to do the tests.  The expert group needs to get out on the ground, sooner rather than later.  It was indicated earlier that would not happen, perhaps, until September.  It must happen sooner in Mayo.  The drum has been beating for a long time.  Things have been looked after here on the east coast.  They need to be looked after on the west coast.  These are people's homes.  In fact, if it is not sorted, these people will be out of their homes and we will have another problem to deal with, aside from the stress that they are going through.  I ask the Minister of State whether he is in a position, now or at another point, to get back to me on some of those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#KKK00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving his time.

Everyone today has used the word \"crisis.\"  Somehow, they cannot use the word \"emergency.\"  There seems to be some terrible fear that if we say the word \"emergency,\" we are opening up the floodgates.

I am not sure I want local authorities buying affordable accommodation in the market as I want first-time buyers buying affordable properties.  Our local authority spent &euro;500,000 on a house that needed to be done up in Blackrock, County Dublin.

We do not divorce ourselves as a political body because we are in the Seanad, D&aacute;il or the council.

We are a society beyond crisis and in an emergency that is only growing.  We have had at least two years of emergency and it seems we have done nothing but grind to a halt.  As public representatives we have a moral responsibility to demand adequate resources to guarantee the provision of homes for our people.  Previous Governments failed miserably and ignored what was coming down the road.  I have put that to both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, as they ignored an issue that was not rocket science, the lack of homes being built in the face of the growing needs of our population, especially in the Dublin region.<\/p> <p>Homelessness has hit thousands of ordinary families and our mindset on the issue has changed from the single man spoken about earlier.  The count was 109 last night.  Our image now has changed to ordinary families who have lived precariously but have had jobs, with children being comfortable and looked after.  When the jobs were lost in the downturn, they lost their homes because of greed, increased rents and a lack of social housing when many people have to wait at least ten years for such housing.<\/p> <p>As another Senator mentioned yesterday, I am concerned about the mental health and well-being of the 2,000 children currently in emergency accommodation.  As an experienced councillor with a mental health profession, I see these people come to my clinics every week.  Children who are seven, eight or nine are beginning to suck their thumbs again.  They are beginning to be incontinent and doubly incontinent again.  Most tellingly, they have gone dumb and cannot speak of their distress and anxiety.  They are reverting to infantile behaviour and refusing to continue to walk, jump and play.  They are sitting in a corner, dumb.  Day in and day out they are being reared in prams.  They have to get out of accommodation during the day, roam the streets and be accepted, quietly, at night, as if they are an embarrassment to the owners of these hotels.<\/p> <p>There are thousands of so-called hidden homeless who are unaccounted for in box rooms throughout the State.  Every family with a spare room has offered their daughter, son, friends or other family members the space of box rooms.  This cannot go on as it is an emergency.  We must treat it as such.  Let us stop using the word \"crisis\".  We are accountable to those in dire need and we are public representatives.  Let us stand up to the plate.  Fianna F&aacute;il had a good discussion about women's refuge and we must take the issue in the context of the Women's Aid report.  It had horrific findings of damage and destruction - physical, emotional and mental - done to women and children.  We must ensure there is adequate financing and resources for people caring for women and children in such cases.<\/p> <p>I ask Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to stop shouting from the rooftops, as they so eloquently put some of their speeches, and support the amendment moved by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, along with the motion for rent certainty to prevent homelessness.  It would go some way to mitigating the increase in rents by linking it to the consumer price index.

In the local authority I worked for there is a 12-week turnaround for housing, which is quite good.  I think it is similar throughout the country.

Who in this room can say they have not made mistakes or done things they might regret today?  I agree with Senator Devine that this is an emergency.  We throw out statistics: tonight 2,121 children will sleep in emergency accommodation, 1,700 of those in this city alone but as the Senator said, behind each of those is a family.  We can only look in horror at what the repercussions of that situation will be in years to come.<\/p> <p>There are two ways to tackle this emergency.  First, introduce emergency measures, such as increasing rent allowance, which is all we can do.  There is no silver bullet solution to the housing crisis.  We need a strategy and a vision.  In my county we talk about the number of hectares zoned for housing.  How much of that zoned land could be built on tomorrow?  How much infrastructure is there?  In my county there is a serious shortfall in infrastructure.  Without the infrastructure, zoning land is a waste of time.  <\/p> <p>Second, we also must explore what type of housing we need.  Families today are much smaller than they were 20 or 30 years ago.  There are more separations and divorce, partners move out and need accommodation.  Those are all factors.  We need to consider long-term leases on property.  For a long time the mentality in this State was that renting a house was a short-term measure, for six months or a year.  Now people can end up renting for 20 years.  Families need to be protected and perhaps we need legislation to give them long-term security, so that they will know where they will be and will not get a letter one day telling them they have two or three months to vacate the property.  <\/p> <p>I was at a conference last weekend where a gentleman quoted a statistic from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that every week 200 houses go out of commission in this country.  That is a frightening statistic.  I was not aware of it before then.  What do we do about that?  Do we tax that property?  Do we give the owners an incentive to bring them back into commission?  We need to consider all these issues.<\/p> <p>The tenant purchase scheme is back in vogue, whether we like it or not and we can argue about its economics.  Those in Part V housing are precluded from purchasing their houses.  The Minister of State might consider that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#MMM00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members who contributed to this debate with their insights into this housing crisis.  I thank Fine Gael for supporting the motion.  It means a lot that this House is passing this motion on an agreed basis.  As Senator Norris said, this sends out a very clear signal that this House is prioritising housing and homelessness.<\/p> <p>In her very eloquent contribution Senator Devine said how important the issue of homeless children is.  In my work I have come across the infantile behaviour these children are reverting to.  I have seen children who live in buggies and have not developed their core strength and cannot walk at the correct time.  This lack of development will work against them later in life and we should take this into consideration too.  It is an emergency.<\/p> <p>Senator Coffey referred to the timing between granting funding and delivering these housing units.  These children do not have that time.  We should seriously consider some system to take care of these children.  I think it was Senator Kelleher who referred to a system for tracking these children.  That is a very good suggestion and we in Fianna F&aacute;il would support it to monitor these children as they move through the system.<\/p> <p>Senator Coffey referred to the Part V requirement.  He mentioned the cash in lieu of abiding by the requirement.  I admit it was perhaps a mistake and we hold our hands up.  However, I put it to him that moving the requirement from 20% to 10% will have the same effect as accepting cash in lieu.  The Minister of State might reconsider that.  <\/p> <p>Senators Coffey, Mulherin and Feighan referred to urban regeneration.  Senator Feighan reflected on his experience of growing up over a shop.  Many generations in Ireland were reared on main streets, above shops.  I support what Senator Mulherin said, that perhaps we should consider a tax incentive for first-time buyers and owner-occupiers to come back into towns and villages and live over the shop or take over terraced houses.  There could be a grant for them to upgrade these properties and bring them up to modern living standards.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Norris also referred to how vulture funds have put people out of their homes, which is something the Government should look at.  It was referred to by another speaker that a four-year window will close rapidly and that will present its own problems in another few years.<\/p><p>Senator Mulherin referred to the pyrite situation in the west of Ireland.  The east coast has not completely resolved the matter.  In my constituency of Dublin Fingal we have a serious pyrite problem.  I have met families who bought starter homes but cannot move home due to the pyrite problem.  Some families want to remain in their starter homes but want to perform home renovations and add extensions to accommodate their growing families.  Unfortunately, they are unable to carry out such works until the pyrite situation is resolved.  People have put their lives on hold for ten or 11 years at this stage.  I urge the Minister of State to look at the matter and to make sure that people no longer keep their lives on hold.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said that Fianna F&aacute;il had a brass neck to table this motion.  The only brass neck in this Chamber belongs to Sinn F&eacute;in.  As my colleague, Senator Davitt, has pointed out, Sinn F&eacute;in is in power in local authorities in Dublin yet the party has done nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#MMM00400","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#NNN00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Senator, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#NNN00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Many speakers have pointed out-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#NNN00400","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>That is absolute nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016061500002#NNN00500","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1465983000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>-----that the vast majority of the more than 2,000 children who are homeless live in Dublin.
