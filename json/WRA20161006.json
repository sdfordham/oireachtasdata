Entitlement to the BTEA is conditional on having an on-going entitlement to the qualifying scheme payment.  Changes have been introduced gradually to the BTEA following a review carried out on employment supports schemes in 2012.

Participants spend 12 months on JobPath and receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports.  If the jobseeker secures employment they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.<\/p>  <p>  Seetec has 32 years&rsquo; experience in the UK of delivering employability, skills, training and rehabilitation programmes that are designed to support people into sustained employment, education and training or to support rehabilitation.

Unlike the UK service, JobPath contracts stipulate a significant number of requirements, including an in-built &ldquo;Service Guarantee&rdquo; which means that each jobseeker will be guaranteed a baseline level of service including frequency on meetings with case officers, treatment with courtesy and respect and  a transparent complaints process.  As part of the contract terms Seetec  is subject to penalty payments if it fails to achieve satisfactory scores in independent research on customer satisfaction with its services.  Payments are also contingent on Seetec satisfying Department inspectors that it is complying with the terms of its contract and most significantly payments are based in the first instance on Seetec securing sustained employment for its clients with these payments being phased over a 12 month period of employment.

USC is payable on earnings above &euro;13,000 per annum, the threshold for payment of the USC having increased significantly over the years, from &euro;4,004 in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The principal employment supplement payment for families with children is Family Income Supplement.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service, others would have worked abroad and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g. caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.  In some cases, a person might never have been in insurable employment.  If such people do not claim a State pension, their details will not form part of the statistics generated by management of those schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore there are no statistics available to my Department detailing the number of people who spent period(s) outside the Irish labour market, and who, as a direct result of those periods, would not qualify for a State pension.  Such statistics would comprise largely of people who have not paid PRSI for many decades, and who in many cases would not have made a claim under the State pension system.<\/p>  <p>  Public service pensions are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600040#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment Eligibility","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[28779\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which exceptional needs payment applications are being assessed to take account of the actual family circumstances, with a view to ensuring the payment remains available to those with an obvious requirement in view of the fact that such payments now replace bereavement grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[29187\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which exceptional needs payments have replaced bereavement grants in respect of the overall cost of funeral expenses where matters such as grave space costs are outside the control of the applicant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 172 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and may not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service for a significant period, others would have worked abroad during their working life and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to abolish either the State pension (contributory), or the State pension (non-contributory), as both are very effective in ensuring that older people have a decent standard of living.  In addition, workers who pay PRSI over their working lives receive a benefit which allows them make further provision for their retirement without losing that benefit via a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[28796\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600041#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will review the processing times and criteria for persons availing of community employment schemes and T&uacute;s as a matter of urgency.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>Participants for T&uacute;s are selected by my Department from those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for 12 months or more.

This also sought the Government's observations including by reference to the ongoing development of the Legal Services Regulation Bill of 2011.  The 2013 Notice of a potential breach is a public document and has, therefore, been a matter of public record.  It should also be noted in this regard that a breach as notified has not yet been determined and it remains, therefore, a &ldquo;potential breach&rdquo;.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Early inquiries raised by the European Commission in 2012 were made by reference to section 123 of the 2011 Bill dealing with the advertising issue and its possible further refinement to ensure compliance with the Services Directive.  From then on the matter was negotiated on the basis of the new provisions being developed by the Government under the Bill and with a view to providing the level of &quot;certainty&quot; of compliance desired by the Commission in the new legislation.  This arose naturally from the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Bill of 2011, including its advertising reforms, came to attention as a specific deliverable under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Programme of that time.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I am happy to say that the legislative solution, negotiated with the European Commission, is that now found under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  Under this provision the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will assume responsibility for the regulation of advertising by both solicitors and barristers - thereby replacing the professional bodies in that function which they had exercised historically.  Hence, the potential infringement has been for resolution by negotiation, at the legislative level.  This has been on the basis of there being a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority that would regulate lawyers&rsquo; advertising instead of the legal professional bodies.  <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">While the Notice of a potential infringement has not technically been lifted, it remains the intention of the Government to continue to address the Commission's concerns through the independent regulation of lawyers' advertising by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority under section 218 of the 2015 Act which will soon be commenced.  Exchanges and clarifications with the Commission are ongoing on that basis.  The Deputy will also wish to note that section 218  also contains a consultation provision whereby the new Regulatory Authority will, before making new advertising regulations, consult with the professional bodies and with the other interested parties concerned.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As the Government is, and remains, the notice party to these ongoing infringement proceedings and the negotiated solution with the European Commission is being achieved under new legislation, there has been limited direct contact on the matter with the professional bodies.  In the case of the Law Society this has been by way of obtaining clarifications on aspects of the application of their existing advertising regulations at the request of the Commission.  In the case of the Bar Council my Department has consulted the relevant provisions of the Council's Code of Conduct and of its Advertising Guidelines for members. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I hope that the Deputy will find the information I have been able to provide in this instance, while also taking into account the fact that the relevant infringement proceedings to which the Government is party are ongoing, to be of assistance in clarifying the current situation.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600044#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[29200\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a use it or lose it by year end rule is or has been in operation within her Department when devolving funding to agencies under her remit on an annual basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Department does not have a defined rule in relation to this matter.

The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a capital nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.<\/p>  <p>  The changes to the AMRF arrangements which I introduced in Finance Act 2014, with effect from 1 January 2015, allow an AMRF owner draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the owner's discretion.  In general, drawdowns from AMRFs (and ARFs) are subject to income tax, PRSI (up to age 66) and USC.<\/p>  <p>  The 4% annual draw down arrangement, replaced the facility that existed previously, whereby an AMRF owner could draw down the accrued income and gains of the AMRF (subject to tax etc.) as and when they wished.  This change was prompted by a concern to allow all AMRF owners, particularly those with relatively modest retirement funds, access to a more certain level of annual drawdown from their AMRF, rather than the uncertain level of drawdown that dependence on investment performance had given rise to heretofore.  This is particularly important for those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds.<\/p>  <p>  As indicated earlier, the primary purpose of the minimum guaranteed pension income condition applying to the ARF option is to ensure that where this condition is not met, that there is a capital nest egg available to the individual in older age.  This condition has been in place since the inception of ARFs in 1999.\u00a0 At that time, it was set at &pound;10,000 which, on the introduction of the Euro in 2002, converted to its Euro equivalent of &euro;12,700.  This was significantly higher than the maximum rate of the contributory State pension payable in 1999 (i.e. &pound;4,628 or &euro;5,876).  It is clear, therefore, that there was no intended link between the State pension and the minimum guaranteed income limit, and in addition that it was never envisaged that the State pension on its own would be sufficient to satisfy the guaranteed pension income test.  Thus, it was always envisaged that an individual would need an additional source of pension income to meet the requirement.<\/p>  <p>  I should add, that when I extended the ARF option to all defined contribution arrangements in Finance Act 2011, the conditions to be satisfied to allow an individual access to an ARF were also amended.  In the case of the guaranteed pension income requirement, this was significantly increased to &euro;18,000 (i.e. one and a half times the annual rate of the contributory State pension at the time) and it was my intention that it would track the annual rate of the contributory\u00a0 pension over time.  However, I rescinded this change in Finance Act 2013 and the guaranteed pension income requirement has remained at &euro;12,700 since. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the fact that the contributory State pension has more than doubled since 1999 while the minimum guaranteed pension test for ARF purposes remains at &euro;12,700, the gap between the two has narrowed appreciably.  If the two were to be aligned, it would have to apply across the board and not just for the type of special case related to health mentioned in the question.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, however, I have no plans at this time to make such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Data","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[29020\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 193 of 27 September 2016, if he will provide a breakdown of the number of multiple property owners in ranges (details supplied) for each of the years 2013 to 2015 inclusive; and the way in which confidentiality may be breached should the ranges requested be provided.","asker":"1259","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[29061\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600045#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 193 of 27 September 2016, if he will provide the total number of properties owned by the 11 persons in the 200-300 category; the total number of properties owned by the 11 persons in the 301-400 category; the total number of properties owned by the fewer than ten persons in the 401-500 category; and the total number of properties owned by the 14 persons in the 500-plus category, in tabular form.","asker":"1259","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that as regards the numbers of properties owned by multiple property owners, the table shows the numbers of properties in the same ranges as provided in response to Parliamentary Question Number 193 of 27 September 2016.\u00a0 <table><tr><th>Numbers of Properties Owned Between<\/th><th>Total Number of Properties<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>200 - 300<\/td><td>2,513<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>301 - 400<\/td><td>3,723<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>401 - 500<\/td><td>3,250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Greater than 500<\/td><td>16,301<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In relation to Question 29020\/19, I am advised by Revenue that a breakdown of numbers of owners of 1,000 plus properties in the ranges requested by the Deputy cannot be provided due to confidentiality considerations.

This would prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions with a likely loss of employment and tax revenue. \u00a0Notwithstanding this, the previous Government was not prepared to stand in the way of EU Member States that wished to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013. <\/p><p>The UK intention to commence the process of leaving the European Union increases the difficulties of introducing such a tax given the potential for the UK to compete more strongly using different domestic measures for such financial services activities outside the EU.<\/p><p>In any event despite significant engagement by the relevant Member States there has been no agreement on the introduction of an FTT and it is not clear whether agreement will be achieved in the near future. <\/p><p>Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424.13 million and I understand receipts to end September 2016 were over &euro;287 million and is expected to raise up to &euro;498m in 2016.\u00a0 If Ireland was to participate in the FTT it would require us to abolish this Stamp Duty.<\/p><p>In relation to the question raised by the Deputy on the potential economic and employment impact of an FTT in Ireland I would refer to the joint Central Bank of Ireland\/ESRI report published in April 2012\u00a0which considered the possible economic impact of the application of FTT <i>()<\/i>.\u00a0 The report analyses the potential economic impact on the financial industry at that stage based on the Commission's 2011 FTT proposal.<\/p><p>While I appreciate that the study may be somewhat dated at this point the report's conclusions are a useful indicator of the possible impact of introducing an FTT in Ireland.  Given that it is Government policy not to introduce an FTT, I do not consider it prudent to allocate resources to further studies or exercises in this regard at this time. <\/p><p>The joint Central Bank\/ESRI report recognises that assessing the likely impact on employment and tax yields due to migration of activity is difficult.  This continues to be the case as it is difficult to assess behaviour arising from the introduction of such a tax and second round impacts on investment and employment. <\/p><p>In 2012 the financial sector's share of overall economic output in Ireland was around twice as large as that of many other European countries and in 2016 it remains a significant element within the economy in terms of employment and gross value added.  There is significant employment in the sector with around 35,000 individuals employed in international financial services.<\/p><p>The report sought to identify financial services sectors which could be impacted by an FTT. \u00a0It suggested that insurance, banking and financial intermediation, and fund management and security broking were potentially vulnerable to an FTT.  Fund management in particular has been one of the growth areas of the financial services sector in Ireland with some large employers and with a total estimated 13,000 employed in the sector.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The report concludes that the firms with the highest propensity to migrate following the introduction of an FTT are likely to be in the non-banking sectors which account for the smallest share of gross value added.

A home reversion agreement is one where an owner sells his\/her home to a Home Reversion Firm (in return for a discounted sum or an income or both) subject to the right to continue to live in the residence until the person permanently moves out or dies.  In substance, this type of agreement involves an up-front property transaction.  Lifetime loans (sometimes called lifetime mortgages or reverse mortgages) on the other hand are credit agreements where a loan is provided and secured on the borrower's home, interest payments on the loan are rolled up on top of the principal amount throughout the term of the loan, the borrower retains ownership of the property and the right to continue to reside in the property and the loan is eventually repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the property after the borrower permanently moves out of the property or dies.  Both of these are niche products, usually provided to people aged 60 or older.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that, from February 2008, the Central Bank of Ireland is the body responsible for the authorisation and supervision of Home Reversion Firms.  However, specific authorisation as a Home Reversion Firm is not required where the firm is the holder of another authorisation from the Central Bank in accordance with Section 29(1) of the Central Bank Act 1997.  Firms authorised to provide mortgage credit in the State may provide lifetime mortgages.  The Central Bank has advised that details of Home Reversion Firms currently authorised in the State and firms authorised to provide credit in the State can be accessed via the Registers section of the Central Bank's website.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further advised that the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (CPC) contains a number of requirements for regulated entities regarding the provision of information to personal consumers relating to lifetime mortgages and home reversion agreements.  The CPC also requires that personal consumers are made aware of the importance of seeking independent legal advice.  In particular, prior to a lifetime mortgage being taken out the CPC requires that a personal consumer must be informed of:<\/p>  <p>  -  the circumstances in which the loan will have to be repaid  <\/p>  <p>  -  details of the interest rate that will be charged  <\/p>  <p>  -  an explanation of the impact of the rolling up of the interest over the duration of the loan  <\/p>  <p>  -  an indication of the amount required to repay the loan at maturity <\/p>  <p>  -  the effect on the existing mortgage, if any; and <\/p>  <p>  -  an indication of the likely early redemption costs which would be incurred if the loan was redeemed on the third and fifth anniversary of the loan and at five yearly intervals thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to a home reversion agreement being taken out, the CPC also requires that a personal consumer must be informed of: <\/p>  <p>  -  the circumstances in which the agreement comes to an end;  <\/p>  <p>  -  the effect on the existing mortgage, if any; and <\/p>  <p>  -  in the case of a variable-share contract, an indication of the potential change in the breakdown of the ownership of the property between that held by the home reversion company and the personal consumer, over the duration of the agreement<\/p>  <p>  Also, certain warning statements must be provided on advertisements, application forms, the regulated entities website and other documents related to lifetime mortgages or home reversion agreements.  For lifetime mortgages, the personal consumer must be warned that while no interest is payable during the period of the mortgage, the interest is compounded on an annual basis and is payable in full in circumstances such as death, permanent vacation of or sale of the property.  For home reversion agreements, personal consumers must be warned that the money they receive may be much less than the actual market value of the share in their home.  For both lifetime mortgages and home reversion agreements, personal consumers must be warned that the product may negatively impact their ability to fund future needs.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, any other loan to a consumer borrower which is secured on residential property, such as a \"top up\" mortgage, will also be subject to the relevant housing loan provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 and the relevant Central Bank Codes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600046#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":224,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600046#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[29176\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600046#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of applying a 9% special rate of VAT on the purchase of all new residential properties for use as a primary dwelling only; and the cost for applying a 9% special rate of VAT to such properties with a purchase price below &euro;350,000 only.","asker":"1217","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that, while precise figures on the amount of VAT from the residential housing sector are not separately identified on VAT returns, the cost of applying a 9% special rate of VAT on the purchase of all new residential properties is tentatively estimated at &euro;190m.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the application of the 9% rate to properties with a purchase price below &euro;350,000 only, I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a &ldquo;fail&rdquo; ceased in 1968.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.\u00a0 Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.\u00a0 In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher-achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower-achieving end of the Higher level distribution.\u00a0 This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics, colloquially known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of &ldquo;bonus points&rdquo; for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).\u00a0 In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students.\u00a0The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.\u00a0 By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.  The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[29015\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the dropout rate in third level institute of technology courses; the measures his Department propose to remedy the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>In line with the overall mission of higher education in Ireland there has been a steady increase in student enrolments over recent years. \u00a0The most recent report by the HEA on retention and progression, entitled 'A Study of Progression in Higher Education 2012\/13 TO 2013\/14', is available on the HEA website, <i>www.hea.ie.<\/i>This is the fourth in a series of progression analysis released by the HEA and examines those 1<sup>st<\/sup>year undergraduate new entrants enrolled in the academic year 2012\/13 and traces them to the following academic year 2013\/14.\u00a0 The report gives an in-depth analysis of the non-progression rates by NFQ level, sector, discipline, gender, age, nationality and socio-economic group. \u00a0There are many factors identified as influencing the likelihood of progression such as Gender, Age at commencement, Prior Educational attainment, nationality and socio-economic grouping.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The report shows that 84% of full-time undergraduate new entrants in 2012\/13 progressed to their second year of study in 2013\/14.\u00a0 The rates of non-progression in 2012\/13 varied within and between sectors ranging from 26% and 28% at levels 6 and 7 to 17%, 11% and 6% at level 8 in universities, institutes of technology and colleges respectively. <\/p><p>The report demonstrates that the overall new entrant non-progression rate was 15% in 2007\/08 and has remained constant at 16% from 2010\/11 to 2012\/13. \u00a0However, rates of progression do vary across the sector and between disciplines and further work will be done to see how students can best be supported to continue on their course or transfer to another programme.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The HEA through the System Performance and Strategic Dialogue process also monitor progression rates within the institutions on an annual basis.  Institutes report on retention measures in place within their institutes to combat high non-progression rates.  The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.\u00a0 In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practicals and maths enabling courses.  In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.\u00a0 The group working with practitioners and industry are examining areas such as career guidance, pathways, provision and pedagogy. <\/p><p>One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (&lsquo;National Access Plan&rsquo;) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups.

The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. <\/p><p>To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group is being established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice. \u00a0The group is being convened by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and will include representatives of relevant stakeholders.  Considerations of members will be informed by recent, qualitative research by the National Forum for Teaching and Learning on the reasons why students leave higher education (National Forum for Teaching and Learning, 2015).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[29016\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600047#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will acknowledge the lack of apprenticeships suitable for a number of employment vacancies such as chefs and in the hospitality sector generally to upskill young unemployed workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Apprenticeship Council was established in early 2014 to oversee the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas.  Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.

The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report of the study was published in November 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one of the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  Established earlier this year, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group is being chaired for the first year by SOLAS.

As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will be funded to deliver new social houses this way.   <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant houses who cannot afford or access the money required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or AHB.  In return, the property owner will sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but is a minimum of ten years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.   <\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have ongoing management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the relevant local authority having regard to the location and suitability of the property for social housing and also the extent of repairs that might be required. <\/p>  <p>  I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this scheme over the next five years.  I am hopeful that this can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021.  Early indications are that in excess of 150 new houses can be made available for social housing through the scheme in 2017.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600050#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600050#WRM01750"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[29045\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600050#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the figures for homeless persons nationally and in the Dublin region; and the number of these persons who have been deemed not entitled to be on a social housing waiting list nationally and in Dublin.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>Official homeless reports are published on my Department's website on a monthly basis and can be accessed using the following link:.<\/p><p>These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS).

It should be noted that the employment supports are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to individual circumstances and a person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes.<\/p>  <p>  One of the principal supports is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities.  For those in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of 6 months or who are in receipt of invalidity pension and who acknowledge, on a voluntary basis, that they may have capacity to undertake some level of employment, the Department&rsquo;s partial capacity benefit scheme is available to assist them to return to the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  These supports, which are estimated to cost almost &euro;44 million in 2016, play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Disability allowance (DA) recipients who, on a voluntary basis, wish to take up rehabilitative employment may avail of the DA employment disregard, which allows them to take up work and earn up to &euro;120 per week without their social welfare payment being affected.  Earnings of between &euro;121 and &euro;350 per week are assessed at 50% for means test purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The measures contained in the strategy seek to address any barriers to employment and improve pathways to work, with the impact on employment building up over time.  Among the DSP commitments contained in the strategy is the setting up of an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities through the examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities and net income earnings from employment.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the CES, the Department is progressively rolling out its full INTREO service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, people with disabilities who present at an INTREO Centre will be offered an interview by an employment support officer with a view to agreeing a suitable action plan. In addition, relevant officers in INTREO Centres are being trained to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.  To date, over 60 employment support officers have received this training.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600052#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Statistics Office Reports","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600052#WRO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[22495\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600052#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on the quality of life issues facing young persons that have come to light from the Central Statistics Office data 2013.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>Since the crisis, there has been widespread agreement on the need for broader measures of social well-being that go beyond income and economic growth.

The analysis by the ESRI is based on data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The researchers defined someone as having a QoL problem if they experience problems on 3 or more of 11 indicators on income poverty, deprivation; financial strain; health problems; mental distress; housing crowding and quality problems; neighbourhood problems; lack of social support; institutional mistrust; and lack of safety.  They found that in 2013 just over a quarter of adults experienced multiple QoL problems.<\/p>  <p>  The research shows that, in line with national poverty and deprivation measures, older people experience lower levels of QoL deficits than adults under 30.  Young adults are 1.8 times more likely to experience QoL problems than older people.  For younger adults crowded accommodation, housing quality problems, deprivation and financial strain are most important.  In contrast, lack of safety, health and neighbourhood problems are more important to older people.<\/p>  <p>  The paper highlights the varied challenges facing adults at different stages of their life-course and the importance of multidimensional measures that look beyond peoples&rsquo; income to a more holistic QoL perspective &ndash; to their health, housing, social interactions, living environment and personal well-being.

","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must satisfy a number of criteria.  One of these is that they have at least 520 paid contributions (i.e. 10 years).  However this of itself does not qualify someone for a full rate contributory pension.  As with such pensions in other countries, there is a separate criterion to decide the rate of payment for those who do qualify.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced in this State, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.<\/p>  <p>  For those who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and\/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.<\/p>  <p>  - Increases for Qualified Adults.<\/p>  <p>  - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness. <\/p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension of up to 95% of the full contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service, others would have worked abroad and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances. In some cases, a person might never have been in insurable employment. <\/p>  <p>  The statistics requested by the Deputy are not available to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Any questions regarding the number of public servants affected by the Marriage bar, or the consequent impact to the public service pension provision would be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600053#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Benefits Data","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[29181\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the fluctuation in the number of persons in receipt of long-term unemployment benefit and jobseeker's allowance in each of the past eight years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and jobseeker's allowance for 12 months and over in each of the past eight years is detailed in the table.<\/p><p><b>Long-term Live Register registrants by scheme, 2008-2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance<\/th><th>Change over previous year -Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance<\/th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit<\/th><th>Change over previous year -Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Sep-16<\/td><td>157,353<\/td><td><\/td><td>2,196<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>170,607<\/td><td>-7.6%<\/td><td>2,094<\/td><td>-44.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>184,601<\/td><td>-6.6%<\/td><td>3,737<\/td><td>-50.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>197,702<\/td><td>-1.9%<\/td><td>7,546<\/td><td>-41.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>201,434<\/td><td>+6.1%<\/td><td>12,994<\/td><td>-19.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>189,830<\/td><td>+20.5%<\/td><td>16,095<\/td><td>-17.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>157,530<\/td><td>+70.3%<\/td><td>19,537<\/td><td>+62.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>92,525<\/td><td>+67.0%<\/td><td>12,038<\/td><td>+38.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>55,397<\/td><td><\/td><td>8,709<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Data","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[29182\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of cases that are pending a decision in respect of an application for domiciliary care allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>There are currently 2,294 applications for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) pending a decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Grant","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[29183\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will improve the respite care grant in the course of the forthcoming Budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>My Department continues to empower and support carers in their caring role through its payment of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant (CSG) formerly known as the Respite Care Grant (RCG).

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.<\/p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, both long term unemployment and youth unemployment continue to fall.<\/p><p>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.4% in Q2 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 51.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q2 2016 was 95,900; this compares to 204,300 in Q1 2012.<\/p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 15.9% (32,400) in September 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 17.0% (35,200) in August 2016 and a peak of over 31.1% (70,500) in 2012.<\/p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate long-term unemployed and young unemployed people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).<\/p><p>A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see Table 1 attached to this reply).<\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p><p>I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in long term unemployment and youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":458,"content":"<p>Question No. 172 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[29188\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the replacement of one-parent family allowance has adequately addressed the issues arising with particular reference to the need to maintain an adequate payment in the household; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>My Department estimates spending &euro;500 million on the one-parent family payment scheme in 2016.  The scheme supports almost 40,800 lone parents and over 73,500 children.  In addition to this, my Department estimates spending &euro;177 million on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment scheme in 2016.  The scheme supports almost 15,000 lone parents.   The aim of the reforms to the One-Parent Family Payment is to better engage with lone parents to assist in the transition from welfare into employment.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.<\/p>  <p>  Access to my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service is critical in achieving this outcome.  Lone parents who transition to jobseeker&rsquo;s transition or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to a Case Officer who assists them in producing a personal development plan.  This tailored plan helps access appropriate education, training and employment support opportunities based on their individual circumstances and requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The final phase of the one-parent family payment age reforms were introduced on 2 July, 2015 bringing maximum age of the youngest child for receipt of the one-parent family payment to 7 years for all recipients.  Approximately 25,500 customers transitioned from the one-parent family payment scheme on that day.  The majority of customers transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment and the family income supplement.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this did result in a reduction in payments for some lone parents, who were working while receiving benefits.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the measures for lone parents contained in Budget 2016, a lone parent on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage saw an increase in their overall income of just over &euro;28 per week (or over &euro;1,450 per annum) from approximately &euro;306 in 2015 to &euro;334 in 2016.  This is as a result of the budget measures and the increase in the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2016 found that employed lone parents experienced an increase of 2% in their household income while unemployed lone parents experienced an increase of 1.8%.  The cumulative impact of Budgets 2015 and 2016 also shows that budgetary policy increased the average household income of employed lone parents by 2.8%.  This compares favourably to an average household increase of 2%.<\/p>  <p>  The latest Quarterly National Household Survey for quarter 2 2016 contains information in respect of employment rates by family composition. In the year to the end of June 2016, the number of lone parent families who were in employment increased significantly by 3.6 percentage points to 56.4%.  This represents four times the increase of all adults with children in employment over the same period.  Interestingly lone parents whose youngest child is aged between 6 and 11 years of age experienced the single largest increase in employment.  Over the year the percentage of these lone parents in employment increased by 7.5 percentage points to 57.2%.<\/p>  <p>  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, many of whom would have been affected last in July 2015 by the reforms, is clearly significant and cannot be dismissed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[29202\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600054#WRQ02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a use it or lose it by year end rule is or has been in operation within his Department when devolving funding to agencies under his remit on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p><b><\/b>My Department has 2 agencies under its remit:<\/p><p>1.

These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach raised the issue with Prime Minister May at their first meeting in July, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, in each of our contacts since his appointment including at our most recent meeting in Dublin on 13 September.<\/p>  <p>  In doing so, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to raise this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.

There remain a number of outstanding issues, but there is an urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.

It should be noted that, while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade processes applications received from outside the State, the decision to award the Centenarian Bounty is the responsibility of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.<\/p><p>Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p><p>- the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million;<\/p><p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;<\/p><p>- measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.<\/p><p>The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 72 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources. <\/p><p>It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. <\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450<b><\/b>Home Care Packages<b><\/b>and<b><\/b>130<b><\/b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.  A further 60<b><\/b>clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  <\/p><p>Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. <\/p><p>The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  This will be considered in the normal way in the context of each annual Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600056#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications Data","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600056#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[29001\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600056#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical card applications received per county in each of the calendar years 2012 to date in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[29002\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600056#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical card applications refused per county in each of the calendar years 2012 to date in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[29003\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600056#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical card applications awarded on appeal per county in each of the calendar years 2012 to date in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 to 195, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine these matters and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

However, the National Suicide Research Foundation recently confirmed that, since 2004, there have been at least 21 murder-suicide cases in this country.  The impact of these events can be devastating, particularly on families and communities. <\/p><p>The National Suicide Research Foundation has also examined the international research literature in the area of murder-suicide.  The outcomes reveal that:<\/p><p>- People involved in murder-suicide are most commonly men;<\/p><p>- The average age of the men involved is 40 and 50 years (age range: 19-86 years);<\/p><p>- Fathers rather than mothers are more likely to take their own life or attempt suicide after they have taken the live(s) of their spouse\/partner and\/or child or children.<\/p><p>Although the available research does not provide information on specific factors associated with murder-suicide, internationally there is consistency with regard to a number of factors that may contribute to an increased risk of the occurrence of these tragic situations:<\/p><p>- 80% of the persons involved in murder-suicide had a history of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression;<\/p><p>- 70% of females and 30% of males had previous contact with a psychiatrist or other mental health care professional;<\/p><p>- Persons involved in murder-suicide show higher rates of prior non-fatal suicidal acts compared to those who take their own lives but not the lives of others;<\/p><p>- 30% of males had recently experienced a decrease in status at work or job loss;<\/p><p>- In 90% of murder-suicide cases involving mothers and in 60% of cases involving fathers, a desire to alleviate real or imagined suffering in their children was reported, for example due to a perceived future of shame without them.<\/p><p>With regard to responding to murder-suicide, in 2011, the National Office for Suicide Prevention published guidelines for responding to situations of murder-suicide and emerging suicide clusters, based on international evidence and best practice.  The guideline document underlines a pro-active approach in that each local health area needs to prepare a response plan that can be activated when these very tragic situations occur.<\/p><p>I would also mention that where murder-suicide in general is concerned, it is usually far more complicated than a simple analysis that mental illness is the cause.  The murder of a family, particularly where children are concerned, grabs public attention because it is one of the most unthinkable of crimes.  It must be remembered that the vast bulk of people who suffer from mental illness are not violent, and the vast bulk of violent acts are committed by people who are not mentally ill.  Indeed, people with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of crime - not the perpetrators of crime.<\/p><p>I will raise the question of whether a study into the cases of murder-suicide in this country would be helpful, in the context of other research needs, with the National Office for Suicide Prevention and the National Suicide Research Foundation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600057#WRT00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600057#WRT00950"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[29053\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600057#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details of waiting times for the 20-week anomaly scan for expectant mothers in all hospitals that provide this scan, in tabular form;

The advent of this transition period was to help to facilitate the switch to the new regulatory framework, which involves non-anonymous gamete and embryo donation for use in donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of non-anonymous gamete and embryo donation, through the provisions of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, is in recognition of Ireland's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that a child has a right to know his or her genetic identity. In order to uphold these rights, through the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, it is first necessary for specific preparatory work to be undertaken, for instance, in relation to the establishment and operation of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and in the preparation of regulations on a range of matters pertaining to DAHR procedures.<\/p>  <p>  An inherent consequence of the transition period is that it defers when the provisions in the Act relating to parentage following DAHR procedures come into force.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll<font color=\"#1F497D\">-<\/font>out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been well over 100 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months. <\/p><p>Since the procurement commenced in December 2015, the contract award timeline\u00a0is being kept under constant review to ensure that the process is robust and delivers effectively and it became apparent earlier this year that further time was needed and this was communicated publically before the Department entered into dialogue with bidders.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a\u00a0range of factors including\u00a0the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at\u00a0key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is\u00a0being\u00a0intensively managed, to ensure\u00a0an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least\u00a025 years. <\/p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys in July 2016.

The work of the task force will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the task force's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Mitigation Plan","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[29056\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"in view of the importance of the issue of climate change and in view of the commitment in the programme for Government to produce a national low carbon transition and mitigation plan and following the establishment of the Climate Change Advisory Council, if the council will issue a public advisory\u00a0statement\u00a0ahead of the publication by his Department of a draft plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[29057\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"in respect of the national low carbon transition and mitigation plan, the person who will be consulted in its development; the process that will be undertaken to develop the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 11(3) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Climate Change Advisory Council\u00a0is independent in the performance of its functions.

This was a consequence of the mapping process, which has been underway since 2013, and which demonstrated that there was a significant fibre-deficit across Ireland\u00a0that this would require a major network build.  It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up\u00a0in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to\u00a0allow ESB to enter the\u00a0telecoms market. \u00a0Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.2m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 200k more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated.\u00a0 Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012.\u00a0 At least two operators\u00a0have announced ambitious\u00a0fibre-to-the-home roll-out plans, one\u00a0of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy. <\/p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project.

Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at\u00a0key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is\u00a0being\u00a0intensively managed, to ensure\u00a0an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least\u00a025 years. <\/p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX02700"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[29192\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100600061#WRX02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if a use it or lose it by year end rule is or has been in operation within his Department when devolving funding to agencies under his remit on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>My Department complies with the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13\/2014 - Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds.

The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a Circular in 2014 regarding the management and accountability of grants to public bodies from Votes of Government Departments.
