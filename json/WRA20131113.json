This is an increase of 1.7% and 7.6% respectively on the 2012 figures.<\/p><p>  Successful transformation of our health services requires a corresponding transformation of the existing funding model.  The first stage in transforming this funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets.

The WHO recognises that international rankings of maternal mortality are, therefore, problematic given the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates of the levels of under-reporting which exist in most countries.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, taking full account of the MDE results, Ireland has amongst the lowest levels of maternal mortality in the developed world and this will continue to be reflected in WHO statistics.  Finally, it also needs to be noted that Ireland is a small country and rare occurrences such as maternal mortality will be subject to significant fluctuations in rates where the data are based on a single year or even where data are aggregated over several years.  As evidence of this, the 95% confidence limits for the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Ireland's MDE covering a three year period (2009 to 2011) range from  4.6 to 12.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 maternities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300068#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Reform","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300068#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[48060\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300068#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timescale for the appointment of chairpersons and board members to the new hospital groupings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure.  These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including <\/p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, <\/p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, <\/p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The price of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.<\/p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines.  Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. <\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August.  The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on 20th and 24th September respectively.  Once the IMB has assessed the initial 20 priority products, then a further list of priority products will be identified and assessed by the IMB and the process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.<\/p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway.  First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.  Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300068#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation Provision","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300069#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[47994\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300069#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the problem of the empty and unused ward in the new West Kerry Community Hospital in Dingle, where a number of beds could be opened and thus alleviate the serious shortage of residential beds on the Dingle Peninsula; if he will make this a priority for Kerry Health Services in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.<\/p><p>  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p><p>  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents. <\/p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. <\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE responds pro-actively to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals in these circumstances. <\/p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.

The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.  <\/p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access GP services that are free at the point of use. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300069#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300069#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[48064\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300069#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way the Budget 2014 figure of &euro;113 million, under the heading of probity savings for medical cards, was reached; the way he expects this cut to be made; if he has estimated the number of full, general practitioner only and discretionary medical cards that will come under this heading; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are a number of separate measures currently underway to ensure sustainability of the market, which include cost control initiatives, revised Risk Equalisation Credits to protect community-rated health insurance for all and the ongoing consideration of appropriate regulatory measures necessary to support the market.<\/p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs, I have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  In June of this year, I  appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin,  who will work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. I want all insurers to address the base cost of their claims and to see all procedures provided in an appropriate, safe, healthcare setting. Work on this review process is progressing well and I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.  <\/p><p>  I am committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  A permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) was introduced with effect from 1 January, 2013. Prior to the introduction of the permanent RES, an Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy had been in operation from 2009 to 2012. Yesterday I received Government approval to the immediate publication of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child. This will help direct support, in the form of higher risk equalisation credits, where it is needed most and will subsidise health insurance for the most vulnerable patients. Under the Health Insurance Acts, I set the rates for risk equalisation credits and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty require to fund those credits.      <\/p><p>  The decreasing membership of the health insurance market, in addition to the adoption of industry-wide strategies, represents a significant challenge to the long term continuation of community rating and sustainability of the market. In particular, the proliferation of plans available on the market and the increasing segmentation of the market due to strategies adopted by the commercial providers is of growing concern to me. I am open to considering any practical measures or initiatives which help to maintain affordability, and provide greater clarity, for consumers seeking to purchase health insurance. I intend to address this further in the New Year in order to simplify things for the consumer and will consider the regulatory measures necessary to ensure a smooth transition from the current system of a voluntary private health insurance market to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300070#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300071#WRE00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300071#WRE00050"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[48427\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300071#WRE00100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Canadian C130 Hercules aircraft which was present in Shannon on 6 November at gate 42 was carrying passengers or cargo.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>Landings of Canadian military aircraft at Shannon are subject to the conditions that apply to all foreign military aircraft that land in Irish airports, i.e. that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.

However, I am informed by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) that caution should be taken with interpreting this disaggregated data due to their small sample size and therefore high margin of error.  According to the data, the combined employment contribution of the NACE codes 20 and 21 in the second quarter of 2013 amounted to about 37,500 employees, or around 2.0 per cent of total economy-wide employment.  My Department is not aware of any official data on the indirect employment resulting from the sector.

Since Q3 2011, net employment has increased by some 27,800.  A number of measures were introduced under the Initiative including the introduction of the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism-related services. Measures to reduce the cost to employers of taking on new employees included a halving in the lower rate of Class A employer PRSI from 8.5% to 4&frac14;% on jobs paying up to &euro;356 per week (&euro;18,523 annually) to apply between July 2011 and the end December 2013. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated numbers of income earners whose main source of income is taxable under the PAYE system and whose annual gross income is less than &euro;18,512, are set out as follows for tax years 2007 to 2013 inclusive.<table><tr><th>Tax Year<\/th><th><div>2007<\/div><\/th><th><div>2008<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012e<\/div><\/th><th><div>2013e<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Numbers (000s)<\/td><td><div>773<\/div><\/td><td><div>716<\/div><\/td><td><div>658<\/div><\/td><td><div>644<\/div><\/td><td><div>612<\/div><\/td><td><div>644<\/div><\/td><td><div>642<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>Source: <\/i>Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Estimated numbers are rounded to the nearest one thousand.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that Gross Income referred to above is as defined in Revenue Statistical Reports.

Work published by my Department found that in year-on-year terms, compared with a range of counterfactuals there was a net employment growth differential of 8-9% in this sector between Q2 2011 and Q2 2012 since the introduction of the reduced rate (MTFS, November 2012). A July 2013 Deloitte Report prepared for Bord F&aacute;ilte found the total increase in jobs following the VAT reduction could be estimated at c.10,000.  The Initiative also provided additional public capital investment of some &euro;109 million targeted specifically towards schools, local and regional roads and national energy retrofitting. Estimates suggest that between 8 and 12 jobs are created directly for every &euro; 1 million in additional capital expenditure, indicating these measures alone directly supported the creation of over 1,000 jobs.

For example, Revenue has answered in excess of 580,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 200,000 letters or emails since March 2013.  Revenue has further advised me that because LPT is a new tax it is difficult to anticipate service volumes and as a consequence the number of agents required.  Revenue has acknowledged that exceptional delays in accessing the Helpline, which is the primary contact point for LPT queries, were experienced by some callers in the days immediately following the issue of the 2014 notifications. Access was also hampered on an intermittent basis on those days by technical issues in the service provider&rsquo;s telephony system which, have since been resolved. <\/p><p>  In response to the demand for service, Revenue ensured that extra resources were deployed to the helpline within two days of the peak period occurring and also deployed extra resources to its own internal support service to cater for the more complex queries.  It has put contingency plans in place to further rapidly increase the number of agents on the helpline should it be necessary to do so.  In total there are now 200 agents fully deployed to LPT telephone call handling.  In addition to the extra staff deployment, callers can now leave their telephone contact details on the system in preference to waiting for service and will receive an out of hours call back from the LPT team.  Revenue has extended the helpline opening hours from 9am to 5pm to 8am to 8pm since 6 November and will maintain these hours for the peak filing periods.<\/p><p>  Revenue has also extended the paper filing date by one week to 14th November to allow people further consider their 2014 payment method before committing their preferred option to Revenue.

The purpose of this fund is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. Authorised credit institutions are required to make contributions to the fund in the form of a resolution fund levy.

This was reflected in the report on Economic and Monetary Union prepared by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank.  The SSM which is the first part of this process was formally adopted by ECOFIN in October and has entered into force. The next important step is the establishment of the SRM. Such a mechanism is considered necessary on the basis of the principle underpinning the banking union that where supervision is centralised it should be complemented with a centralised resolution authority. <\/p><p>  The SRM proposal consists of the Single Resolution Board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by contributions from the financial sector. As the Deputy notes the ultimate decision maker in this process is the Commission, as only an EU institution can carry out such a function and not an agency. While the SRM proposal is under consideration at the Council, the view of the Commission and most Member States is that we should proceed on the basis of the current proposal. <\/p><p>  On the second issue raised by the Deputy regarding resolution of a bank, Article 16 of the draft proposal sets out the procedures to be followed. <\/p><p>  The first step involves the ECB or a national resolution authority making an assessment whether:<\/p><p>(i) an entity is failing or likely to fail;<\/p><p>(ii) having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, there is no other reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector or supervisory action would prevent its failure within a reasonable timeframe;<\/p><p>(iii) a resolution action is necessary in the public interest. <\/p><p>  If the Single Resolution Board is of the view that all of these conditions have been met, it is required to make a recommendation to the Commission that the bank be placed into resolution. If the Commission agrees with the Board, then it will decide accordingly. If it is however of the view that the conditions are not met, there is a due process that must be followed, but ultimately it can decide not to place the entity in resolution and in such circumstances national insolvency law will apply. <\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s final point, there are a number of measures in the proposal which require the ECB to work in conjunction with the Single Resolution Board to ensure consistency so that the system works effectively. Both share the objective of ensuring financial stability and growth in the Euro area. This is considered a crucial step to overcome the current financial fragmentation and uncertainty, to ease funding conditions for sovereigns and banks and to break the link between the two. This is in the best interests of Member States and the banking system as a whole.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, Article 12 of the SRM proposal sets out the resolution objectives, which include the need to avoid significant adverse effects on financial stability <i>&ldquo;in the EU and Member States concerned&rdquo;<\/i>.

The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child.  A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer\/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child.  This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.  <\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.

","asker":"1110","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>As the Deputy has noted, the main tax incentive for innovation in Ireland is the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit which gives a company a tax credit of 25% for expenditure on qualifying R&amp;amp;D.  As was highlighted in the Report of the Review of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit 2013, which is available on the tax policy website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>, this is a very competitive regime by international standards and has been very successful at incentivising investment in R&amp;amp;D in Ireland and supporting employment in Ireland.  The proposal from the Deputy seems similar to the Patent Income Relief scheme which was previously available in Ireland, and which was abolished in 2010.  The decision to abolish this relief was made following consideration of a recommendation to this effect in the Report of the Commission on Taxation (2009).  The Commission on Taxation was of the view that the exemption for patent income was not an effective measure in incentivising enterprises to engage in research and development activities in Ireland and that it had been used instead as a tax-efficient means of remunerating employees and directors.<\/p><p>  The R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit regime provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&amp;amp;D activities.  The scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere in the world, and has been most successful in this regard, as was confirmed by the 2013 Review. <\/p><p>  Further, the &ldquo;key employee&rdquo; element of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit was introduced in 2012 to allow the benefit of this tax credit to be transferred to an individual employee in certain circumstances, and may reward employees for innovation in the way suggested by the Deputy.  This element of the regime is only in its early stages but is gathering momentum and is viewed very positively by innovative firms: according to our independent survey of R&amp;amp;D active firms, which was conducted as part of the 2013 Review, over 70% of firms surveyed are positively disposed to the key employee provision.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to address the broader issue and to assure the Deputy that my Department is always looking at ways that the tax code may be used to incentivise innovation in Ireland.  As was noted in the recent 2013 R&amp;amp;D Report, the responsibility for developing a policy environment that fosters innovation cuts across a number of Departments, including the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as my own Department.  As tax is only one method of incentivising innovation, this report has recommended that the relevant Departments work closely together to make sure that the policy outcomes of each different government support are aligned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300073#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Question No. 56 answered with Question No. 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":145,"content":"<p>Question No. 57 answered with Question No. 53.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300073#WRG01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courses Accreditation","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300073#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[48513\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300073#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding ongoing negotiations between Quality and Qualifications Ireland and a college (details supplied) in Dublin 14 regarding the accreditation of its courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The making of valuations for rating is the Commissioner&rsquo;s sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>  The procedures for making an application for a determination of valuation are prescribed in section 27 of the Valuation Act, 2001, wherein it is provided that any one of the following - an occupier of a property, a rating authority, a person as respects a property to which he\/she is an interest holder or an occupier of a property that appears on a valuation list - may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of an existing valuation or for a new valuation to be determined in respect of a new building. The statutory fee prescribed for the service is &euro;250 which should accompany the application to the Valuation Office.<\/p><p>  Under section 28 (4) of the Act, a Revision Officer appointed by the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised. MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.<\/p><p>  Should the foregoing MCC criteria be satisfied, the appointed Revision Officer will consider the application and determine and issue a valuation for the subject property within a period of six months from the date of his appointment.  The notice of the decision by way of a Proposed Valuation Certificate will issue to the applicant, who, if dissatisfied with the decision, will have the right to make representations in respect of the proposed valuation and will have 28 days to do so, from the date of issue of the certificate. The Revision Officer is required to consider the representations prior to finalising the valuation and issuing a Final Valuation Certificate and amending the Valuation List.<\/p><p>  If dissatisfied with the outcome of the representations, the occupier will have a further statutory right to make an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and thereafter to the Valuation Tribunal.  The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and individual ratepayers.  In relation to the appeal process, I might mention that legislative proposals are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas which would result in the first appeal to the Commissioner being removed, in which case, the appeal would be to the Valuation Tribunal only. This is one of a number of legislative proposals set out in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill which is currently awaiting a Committee stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. However, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to determine how such proposals proceed or otherwise.<\/p><p>  Regarding the levying of rates, the position is that under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the determination of valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Rates can only be collected by the rating authority on property which has been valued under the Valuation Act, 2001 and there is no mechanism to otherwise collect rates pending the determination and issue of the valuation under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300076#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300077#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[48450\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300077#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the annual infrastructure and capital expenditure by the State on a regional basis and a county basis over the past five years.","asker":"1080","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for setting the overall capital allocations across Departments and for monitoring monthly capital expenditure at Departmental level.

The current range of payment options includes payment to an account in a bank, building society or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators, payment at a local post office or payment by cheque. <\/p><p>  The Department has undertaken a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches. This resulted in the preparation of a Payment Strategy which was approved by Government and will be published before the end of the year.  The aim of the Payment Strategy is to modernise the Department&rsquo;s payment delivery approach by delivering payments to customers electronically and in a way that facilitates direct debits, ATM withdrawal, point of sale deductions and online payments by customers. The Strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash. At present, 50% of all social welfare payments are disbursed in cash. This amounted to approximately &euro;9.5 billion distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year. The analysis undertaken for the Payment Strategy indicates the very significant variation in the cost of different payment methods. The cost of issuing a welfare payment in cash is six and a half times more than paying to an account in a financial institution and three times more than issuing a payment by cheque rather than EFT.<\/p><p>  The Payment Strategy sets out a multi-phased approach to be implemented over five years. The first phase has commenced with contract negotiations underway with An Post to maintain existing over the counter cash services. This will ensure that customers can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future. It provides an assurance in the continuity of cash payments to customers for up to six years while other aspects of the Strategy are progressing. <\/p><p>  The next phase of the Strategy will be the progressive migration of customers to Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments.  The move to electronic payments for social welfare transactions is a trend that has been apparent for some time, and we have seen that most new social welfare customers (aside from jobseekers) are choosing EFT as their preferred method of payment.  Last year four out of every five new customers claiming child benefit elected to be paid into an account. The Department does not intend migrating higher risk customers to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate any potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment. <\/p><p>  Moving to electronic payments will require a significant effort to assist and support suitable customers over the five year period.  The Department will work energetically to help customers and their representatives in the transition period.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that customers will not be refused a payment simply because they cannot receive it electronically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300080#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300080#WRO00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300080#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[48444\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300080#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will investigate the acquisition, for the State, of Tullira Castle, Adrahan, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Tullira Castle, built in 1882 with an adjoining fifteenth-century tower, is included in the Record of Monuments and Places maintained by my Department under the National Monuments Acts.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Commercial decisions by individual private operators in relation to its infrastructure are a matter for the company concerned.  Any regulatory issues surrounding the provision of services are the responsibility of ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kerry, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kerry.  This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by service providers.  ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the roll-out of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300081#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Expenditure","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300081#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[48469\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300081#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of applicants in County Meath that have received funding under the better energy warmer homes scheme and the better energy homes scheme; the total amount of State funding that has been paid out to applicants in County Meath under each of these schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Homes and the Better Energy Warmer Homes Schemes are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the Better Energy Programme.

In addition to this dedicated Unit there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue namely:<\/p><p> - the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p><p> - the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive;  and<\/p><p> - a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>  Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff in the New Communities and Asylum Seekers Unit in the Department of Social Protection facilitates victims moving into mainstream social services.  There are also a wide range of training and awareness raising activities ongoing and extensive consultation structures exist with up to 70 State Agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations and International Organisations.<\/p><p>  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking including those persons who have been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  These services include accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive develops individual comprehensive Care Plans for all persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking (including those who have been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation) addressing all of the support services that are required.  My Department also provides funding to Ruhama who work with predominately with female victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  A detailed Guide to the Procedures for supporting and protecting victims of human trafficking, along with other Guides and leaflets, are accessible on the dedicated anti-trafficking website <b>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie<\/b>.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of Human Trafficking (including the trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation) is set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons 2009-2012 which set out 144 Actions to address this issue.  A copy of the National Action Plan and a Review of the Plan are available on the dedicated Anti-Trafficking site www.blueblindfold.gov.ie.  A new National Action Plan to cover the period from 2013 to 2016 is currently being prepared.  A process of consultation with other state agencies and civil society which will significantly inform the direction and content of the new National Action Plan.  The prevention and detection of human trafficking and the protection of its victims has also been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300085#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300085#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[48480\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300085#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on suspicious cars driving around an area (details supplied) in Dublin 9 last week.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

The advice for 2014 is that landings should be no more than 889,886 tonnes. <\/p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, mackerel is Ireland&rsquo;s most important fishery, and the long running situation whereby both Iceland and the Faeroes have been engaged in unacceptable and irresponsible fishing of this stock has been, and is, a matter of deep concern to me. My approach as Minister has always been to engage in the negotiations between the EU and the other Coastal States (Iceland, Faeroes &amp;amp; Norway) with a view to protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests while at the same time being prepared to go some way towards meeting the expectations of Iceland and the Faeroes.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I have placed this issue on the agenda of the Council of Fisheries Ministers on numerous occasions, most recently at the meeting held on the 17th of October.  In advance of that meeting, I also held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Damanaki, Spanish Fisheries Minister Canete, UK Minister Eustice and Scottish Minister Lochead to press Ireland&rsquo;s case.  At the Council meeting, I sought information from the Commission (who negotiate on behalf of the EU at the Coastal States meetings) on the current state of play in the negotiations and, in particular, details on the Commissions&rsquo; discussion with Norway, a key partner for the EU on this issue.<\/p><p>  I have consistently argued that any new offer to Iceland must be jointly agreed with Norway on the basis of equal burden sharing, that Iceland should not be granted access to EU waters as a part of any deal and that any deal must also protect the interests of EU Member States like Ireland who have relied on this fishery for over 40 years. I have always made it clear, however, that I was not opposed to a deal and recognized that Iceland (and Faeroes) should be provided with fair and justifiable quota shares.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, I asked that the Commissioner and my fellow Ministers give serious consideration to a proposal developed by the European Pelagic Industry that would involve a tiered approach with different percentage shares for each of the Coastal States depending upon the level of the Total Allowable Catch advice from year to year.  The core concept behind this proposal is to protect those fleets that have developed and now depend upon the mackerel fishery over a long number of years. <\/p><p>  I was pleased that the Commissioner and many of the Member States took away this concept for more detailed examination in advance of the Coastal State negotiations in London on the 22nd  of October, and with the positive consideration of all of the points raised by me.<\/p><p>  At the negotiations in London on 23\/24 October, in addition to my officials, Ireland was also represented at industry level.  Unfortunately however, there was little by way of concrete progress.  In large part this was due to the fact that a new Norwegian Fisheries Minister had only been appointed the previous week. One positive aspect was that, again at Ireland&rsquo;s instigation, there was a detailed presentation to, and exchange of views with Member States, from the European Pelagic industry on their proposal. <\/p><p>  Another round of Coastal State negotiations is now due to take place in Clonakilty from 18-22 November.  Ireland will play a constructive role at those negotiations and will leave no stone unturned in an effort to reach a solution that is balanced and fair to all of the parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300087#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Applications","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300087#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[48448\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300087#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area aid application will be cleared for payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 and 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases were impacted upon by the requirement to have achieved a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011.

","asker":"1014","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which operates under the aegis of my Department, has a statutory remit to encourage and support regular school attendance. The NEWB monitors school attendance nationally and I recently launched the Analysis of School Attendance Data for the 2010\/2011 school year.  These data show a continued improvement in student attendance from 2009\/2010 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006\/07 &ndash; 2010\/11 and the continued positive trend over recent years is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  While every incremental improvement represents real progress the number of children who miss school each day remains a significant cause for concern. The report highlights the need for sustained and focussed approaches to supporting student attendance, especially within particular groups in society.  In the case of schools serving disadvantaged areas, the data shows that absences over 20 days in these schools are down 1% on the previous year&rsquo;s figures (2009\/10) and 3% from 2008\/09. The overall improvements in attendance data in general demonstrate the positive impact of targeted investment programmes and the progress that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.<\/p><p>  Within the NEWB, the Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Board&rsquo;s general statutory function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. I am advised by the NEWB that the Education Welfare Service worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer and a multidisciplinary approach, in collaboration with schools, families and other services, in order to address the issues underlying poor school attendance.<\/p><p>  The NEWB is also developing guidelines for schools on the development of school attendance strategies. The guidance will provide practical advice to schools in their task of enabling children to maximise their attendance, participation and retention in schools. The Board intends to complete this work within the current academic year.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills DEIS school support programme (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) is part of a continuum of interventions designed to address the needs of 3 to 18 year olds from disadvantaged communities. DEIS adopts an integrated approach with early intervention as a core principle. Designated DEIS schools are supported in developing school based plans to facilitate self-evaluation against a range of self-determined targets, including the setting of targets on school attendance as a prioritised area of activity.  My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach is taken to effectively target our respective resources to support children at risk of poor school attendance and early school leaving.  In relation to DEIS schools, the NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (74 front-line Education Welfare staff); Home School Community Liaison Programme (comprised of 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (comprised of 124 school cluster projects involving 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools in relation to attendance, participation and retention. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.<\/p><p>  The amalgamation of the NEWB&rsquo;s services into the new Child and Family Agency upon its establishment will further consolidate the development of services aimed at children and provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in such services. The Child and Family Agency will have a specific legislative remit to promote educational outcomes through its educational welfare programmes.  In the case of schools servicing disadvantaged areas, work to improve outcomes in school attendance will be a collaborative venture involving the existing three service strands, schools themselves, parents and young people, other Departments, agencies and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300090#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Justice Strategy","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300090#WRY00650"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[48467\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300090#WRY00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she intends to publish a successor strategy to the national youth justice strategy 2008-10; the reason no successor strategy has been published to date; her assessment of the impact of the 2008-10 strategy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Orthodontic referrals are generally received via the Public Dental Service school screening programme. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined in accordance with the Modified Index of Treatment Need. The dental health component has five categories ranging from 1 (no need for treatment) to 5 (great need). Further sub-divisions of these categories are substantially based in accordance with the causes of malocclusion, e.g. misalignment of teeth. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment. <\/p><p>  At the time of assessment those with urgent clinical need are prioritised. It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only.

I wrote to the HSE on Thursday 31 October to confirm that the Executive has until 15 November to submit its Service Plan. In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible.    A key priority for 2014 will be to further support the eight designated cancer centres, within available resources, to maintain continued improvements in diagnosis, surgery and multi-disciplinary care.<\/p><p>  I welcome the huge improvements that have been made in recent years, led by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. It is very encouraging to note that five year relative survival for all cancers is rising and is now 56.4% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, as compared with 49.6% for people diagnosed in 1998-2002. Clearly 2014 will be a very challenging year for the health services. In meeting this challenge, the goal, wherever possible, is to cut the cost of services rather than the level or quality of the services delivered, and to accelerate the pace of reform. The reform programme for hospitals, as set out in <i>Future Health, <\/i>  aims to deliver more responsive and equitable access to services for all patients; to organise public hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups, which can deliver better patient care for less cost; and to ensure that smaller hospitals continue to play a key role. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300094#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300094#WRCC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[48532\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300094#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the EU new cross border directive will be implemented; the amount of funding provided to initiate same; the expected health care benefits to the Irish consumer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>The EU Directive on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare provides rules for the reimbursement to patients&rsquo; of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State (Member State of Affiliation) and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883\/04).<\/p><p>  The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country.

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.<\/p><p>  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p><p>  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents. <\/p><p>  Since the beginning of 2011, the Government has taken measures and provided funding to ensure that an additional quarter of a million people have a medical card.

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. <\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.

The data available on the private health insurance market in recent years shows a number of factors which are affecting private health insurance costs.  The reduction in the numbers holding private health insurance, the age profile of those holding private health insurance, increases in claims costs, increases in premiums, and the overall state of the economy are all having an impact on the private health insurance market and its sustainability. <\/p><p>  I am determined to address rising costs in the private health insurance sector in the interests of consumers.  I want insurers to address their base costs, and have made it clear to insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  Last year I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, comprising representatives from the private health insurance companies, my Department, and the Health Insurance Authority, to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  I appointed an independent Chairperson Mr. Pat McLoughlin who is working with my Department and the insurers under the auspices of the Forum on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market and I expect to receive his initial report shortly.<\/p><p>  While competition is evident in the Irish private health insurance market, insurers have concentrated on competing for younger lives. Competition in a community rated health insurance system needs to be supported by risk equalisation, a mechanism to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers. There has been a history of challenges to risk equalisation in Ireland, with the original risk equalisation scheme struck down in 2008.   A temporary scheme was introduced in 2009, which I greatly improved in 2012 and I also put in place a permanent scheme of risk equalisation for the first time in 2013.  There is a need to continue developing risk equalisation in order to protect the health insurance market and to ensure competition is on the basis of service and quality, not risk profile and I encourage insurers to compete actively to insure all lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Regulation","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[48545\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, in the context of private health insurance, efforts have been made to encourage all insurers to take on a cross-section of the age cohort thereby preventing advantageous trading by any insurer; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the need to ensure that there is a fair and balanced private health insurance market in Ireland. The Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2012 provide the statutory basis for the regulation of the health insurance market in the interest of the common good.  At the centre of the common good in a community-rated health insurance market is inter-generational solidarity between all insured persons. Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. The objective has always been that the price of a policy should reflect the risks and costs of the entire pool of insured persons in the community, rather than the risks and costs on a person by person basis and indeed on an insurer by insurer by basis.<\/p><p>  The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are a number of insurance companies in the market. If a mechanism to share risk and attendant costs is not present, an insurer with a less profitable risk profile can quickly find themselves in a perilous position financially. The standard transfer mechanism is known as risk equalisation   and it is a key element of health insurance, not just in Ireland but internationally. Risk equalisation is a process that aims to equitably neutralise differences in insurers&rsquo; claim costs that arise due to variations in the health status of their members. The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole, and to distribute fairly the differences that arise in insurers&rsquo; costs due to the differing health status of all of their customers. Risk equalisation aims to make health insurance more affordable for older people by supporting community-rated premiums. In general, younger people pay more and older people pay less than what would normally apply in a risk-rated system. <\/p><p>  I am committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  A permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) was introduced with effect from 1 January, 2013. Prior to the introduction of the permanent RES, an Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy had been in operation from 2009 to 2012. Yesterday I received Government approval to the immediate publication of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child. This will help direct support, in the form of higher risk equalisation credits, where it is needed most and will subsidise health insurance for the most vulnerable patients. Under the Health Insurance Acts, I set the rates for risk equalisation credits and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty require to fund those credits.      <\/p><p>  These measures will ensure that we continue to protect community rated health insurance, which is a vital part of our health system, now and in the future as we move to Universal Health Insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[48546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111300095#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of instances reported whereby patients seeking treatment for cancer have been put on waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>The quality and safety of our health services, including cancer services, has been a focus over the past number of years and this will continue in 2014 in the context of the HSE Service Plan for 2014.

In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible. A key priority for 2014 will be to further support the eight designated cancer centres, within available resources, to maintain continued improvements in diagnosis, surgery and multi-disciplinary care.<\/p><p>  Clearly, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer is a high priority for my Department and the HSE. I welcome the huge improvements that have been made in recent years, led by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. It is very encouraging to note that five year relative survival for all cancers is rising and is now 56.4% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, as compared with 49.6% for people diagnosed in 1998-2002. The HSE has established symptomatic breast clinics and rapid access, lung and prostate clinics in each of the eight cancer centres. Performance of these clinics is monitored through the collection of key performance indicators. The HSE has advised that in Q3 2013, access targets for both urgent and routine referrals to breast cancer clinics are being exceeded in the designated cancer centres in aggregate (95%).  In relation to access to lung cancer clinics, 94.9% of patients in Q3 2013 in aggregate were offered an appointment within 10 working days, just under the target of 95%. While further progress is required in relation to access targets for prostate cancer clinics in Q3, the percentage of patients being offered an appointment within the target time is 50.2%, up from 47% last year.   All referrals to these centres are triaged and urgent cases are prioritised and appointments offered to all appropriate patients in the first instance.<\/p><p>  With regard to paediatric cancer care, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin is the national tertiary paediatric and adolescent referral centre for all cancer services.

The Public Service Stability Agreement 2013- 2016 (The Haddington Road Agreement) provides for health service staff to increase their working hours.  The value ascribed to this element of the Agreement is in the region of five million hours annually for the health workforce as a whole.  In the case of nurses and midwives, the standard working-week has increased from 37.5 to 39 hours.   Given the number of nurses and midwives in the public health service (about one-third of the workforce), these additional working-hours represent significant additional capacity. <\/p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement also provides for the implementation of the Graduate Nurse\/Midwife Placement Initiative on an agreed basis with the health unions.
