I am accompanied by Dr. Tom McDonnell of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, which is an ICTU-funded economic research unit.  He is happy to assist in answering questions.  Core domestic demand grew by 3.4% in the third quarter of last year and the short-term outlook for the economy seems reasonably positive despite the threat posed by Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding US policy.  I am informed by NERI that its baseline estimate for real GDP growth in 2017 stands at 3.4%.  NERI forecasts that domestic demand will increase solidly in 2017 on the back of a strengthening labour market while the end-year general Government deficit should be close to balance, albeit marginally negative.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the unemployment rate is improving and we believe that it will reach 6.5% by the end of this year and it is reasonable to expect that hourly and weekly earnings will finally start to rise significantly in 2017.  Such an increase in wages is long overdue with average hourly earnings lower now than they were in 2009 and essentially stagnant since 2013 despite three years of fast employment growth and declining unemployment.  The medium-term outlook is less positive with a Brexit related recession possible in 2019.  Brexit is set to have a negative and long-lasting impact on the Irish economy.  We did not say any more about Brexit in our written submissions, but we will answer questions on it if there are questions.  We did not wax lyrically about the subject because we attended this committee before with a separate grouping to discuss that matter.  <\/p> <p>  What are the correct responses to the changing global economy and the external threats to our collective economic prosperity?  We must act strategically and increase our efforts to build up the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity over the long term.  To this end there needs to be much greater public investment in productive infrastructure such as public transport, rural broadband, the intercity motorways and renewable energies along with higher levels of investment in education, publicly funded R&amp;D and in the development of an advanced innovation system.  Such investments will enable the economy to develop sustainably and will improve living standards through productivity-led growth.  In particular, public capital investment needs to be doubled from its current unacceptably low level.  Congress proposes that an explicit target should be set by Government for total spending on public capital as a percentage of total economic output.  A target of 4% of economic output over the economic cycle is broadly appropriate.  The public investment target could fall as low as 3% when the economy is booming and could rise as high as 5% during recessions.  The Government&rsquo;s proposed rainy day fund could facilitate this with money adding to the rainy day fund during boom times and then being withdrawn from the fund in recessionary times.  This would enable investment to operate as a counter-cyclical force within the economy.  <\/p> <p>  This leads us on to budgetary priorities.  Congress has consistently argued for an inclusive equality-proofed budget that places the welfare and betterment of the majority at its very core and that will prioritise higher living standards and deliver this through a transformative programme of investment in infrastructure, services and service delivery.<\/p><p>This must be reflected in a sufficient, fair and progressive tax system.  Not only do the long years of crisis demand that the process of social repair begins without delay, but recent events in the US, the UK and across Europe make this a compelling necessity.  To the extent that the Government has leeway, namely in the dreaded fiscal space, it should use that limited space to increase investment in the social wage by prioritising four key areas, which we have set out consistently in our pre-budget submissions.  These are housing and homelessness, which is now an emergency, child care, community health services, as well as education and training.<\/p><p> Government spending needs to be increased in each of these four areas as part of a strategic plan to improve living standards and social inclusion.  We must begin with housing.  We do not have a housing and homelessness crisis but an emergency.  Existing policy approaches and the market have failed.  This should be a source of shame for all people, especially for policymakers.  In such circumstances, the needs of the citizens require that the State steps in and leads the solution with a major programme of home building.<\/p><p> Money spent on education and health must be treated as an investment and not a cost.  Our health service will only be fixed by moving to an adequately resourced and universally accessible single-tier public system.  Likewise, investment in an accessible, inclusive education system is a prerequisite for an equal society and a thriving economy.<\/p><p> Policy failure in child care can be addressed by raising investment to European levels.  The high cost of child care in this country is a major barrier to labour market entry and, significantly, contributes to the loss of high quality skills, experience and knowledge in the workforce.<\/p><p> Overall, by improving and augmenting the social wage, we can generate tangible improvements in living standards and address some of the corrosive social deficits which have arisen over recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#D00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Ms Patricia King referred to the dreaded fiscal space.  These are the parameters with which we are all working, however.  Even those of us who submit alternative budgets have to work with the figures presented to us, even if we have differences of opinion as to how the rules should be applied.  The difficulty we face next year is that there will be a &euro;500 million carryover cost because of measures introduced in last year's budget for which a full-year cost was not applied.  Accordingly, the fiscal space has shrunk from what it was a year ago.  That means the discretionary spend has significantly reduced and there will not be huge scope for investment or cutting taxes, if that is what the Government proposes to do.<\/p> <p>  The only way we can increase the fiscal space is to either achieve savings in public spending or increase revenue and taxes.  Ms Patricia King spoke about a fair and progressive taxation system.  What concrete proposals has ICTU made for expanding the fiscal space by way of discretionary tax measures?  Has it proposals on spending and savings?<\/p> <p>  An argument can be made that the capital spend should be decoupled from the fiscal rules.  Many organisations which have attended the committee have supported this.  Ireland has one of the lowest capital spends in the European Union.  That happened because the economy collapsed and the easy thing to do was to stop and slash capital spending.  Ms Patricia King mentioned transport, broadband, education, research and development.  There are significant capacity problems in many of these areas which will require significant investment.  How can we do that if we are operating solely on the basis of a shrinking fiscal space and we have to adjust for carryover costs?<\/p> <p>  I have argued with other delegations before this committee that if we have a shrinking fiscal space with less money available, as well as demands in education, housing, capital needs and so on, how can we continue to reduce the tax base by phasing out or abolishing the universal social charge, as the Government is doing?  Is that the best policy decision?<\/p> <p>  Obviously, public sector pay will create pressures.  We have no agreement on it and there are no provisions made for 2019, 2020 or 2021.  To unwind FEMPI, the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, would cost in the region of &euro;1.4 billion.  There are different commitments to do this and it depends on how it is done, when it is done, who is prioritised and so on.  What is the position of congress, notwithstanding the Lansdowne Road agreement and it seeing out its timespan?  In the context of a new agreement, what is congress's demand for outstanding public sector pay for 2019, 2020 and 2021?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#D00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have consistently set out in pre-budget submissions and other places our view of a fair taxation system.  The OECD, the IMF, EUROSTAT and others say Ireland is not a high-tax or a high-spend economy.  When one does a comparison with other European countries, one finds in the pattern that Ireland has a very poor social wage system.  Across the EU, be it the EU-15 or wider, the employer social contribution - PRSI - is much higher than it is here.  When discussing competitiveness, the cost of wage and labour costs, much inaccurate information comes out about the employer social contribution.  The fact of the matter is that one of the key features of the Irish labour market and our taxation system - if one calls it that - is this low social contribution on the employer side.

The National Competitiveness Council and other organisations come out with various sets of figures periodically.  Ireland has the lowest social wage, as well as the lowest value the worker gets from that social wage, be it sick pay or whatever.  The comparisons come out bad on the workers' side.  Employers, as well as several political representatives, make statements about tax levels.  On the face of it, it is a low-tax regime.  However, when a comparison is done with other EU member states, one is looking at an entirely different picture.  From congress's point of view, we want to get into a space where there is much more equity.  Compare what workers in Ireland have against what workers in France have with sick pay, maternity benefit and child care.  We all know child care costs in Ireland are the second highest and highest in the OECD for couples and lone parents respectively.<\/p><p>What happens in other EU states in respect of the provision of those services?  The answer reveals a far better picture in other states, even, dare I say, in the United Kingdom, although that comparison will take on a different hue shortly.<\/p><p> We have said in our submissions that reforming the revenue base requires reform of capital taxes and tax breaks.  We believe a minimum of &euro;180 million could be raised in budget 2017.  I have absolutely no doubt that we will say the same thing for the next budget with particular attention paid to reliefs available at marginal rates and the suite of reliefs related to capital acquisitions tax.  In our judgment, there is considerable room to extract unfair tax reliefs and so on.  They should be stripped out.  We have heard political representatives support and object to the idea.  We have consistently argued that there should be a net wealth tax focused on households with net assets in excess of &euro;1 million.  We have priced it and we believe it could collect &euro;300 million in net additional revenue during 2017.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the USC charge in principle.  This is relevant for the example I have just outlined relating to child care.  There are others areas in the education system and so on where we believe it should realise a real social charge.  It should be a social contribution.  It should be hypothecated effectively to deliver what it is supposed to deliver.  That would bring about a far fairer and more transparent system.  If we are putting in a given amount by way of social contribution, then a given service should be provided as a result.

Essentially, there are five ways to do it.  We can simply allocate a larger amount within the fiscal space on the basis of faster expenditure growth.  That can only be done through discretionary revenue measures, as we know.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has indicated the position on current spending.  The estimated additional expenditure in a standstill scenario, i.e. taking into account demographic and price changes, is already at the point of the allocation for current spending.  The only way we can dig into current spending is through potential efficiency savings.  Without changing the composition there would have to be cuts.  There is an investment clause.  However, it does not apply to Ireland because it is only relevant when the output gap is at a certain level, in other words, when the economy is close to recession.  There is a structural reform clause.  This is very difficult to invoke and it has never been shown in practice.  We would need to show that the reform undertaken would generate a faster rate of growth and would definitely lead to a more productive economy in future.  It could be imagined in a post-conflict situation or after a severe recession where there is a clear infrastructural deficit.  For example, five or ten years ago it might have been relevant for rural broadband.  It might be tougher now.  It is something where we would have to see a productivity increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>It might be still relevant to that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#E01400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It could still be relevant.  However, the argument would have to be made on a specific project like that rather than in respect of the overall envelope.  My research has shown that as one area where there would be definite gains.  We also have special purpose vehicles and the European Investment Funds.  These can be used to get certain items off-balance-sheet.  I know that is being examined at the moment in the context of additional funding for housing.<\/p> <p>  We can front-load capital spending because of the four-year horizon currently in use.  Essentially, the increase in capital spending could be approximately 25% in the first year and a similar amount could apply in subsequent years.  That would be a way of bringing forward capital spending but it does not get around the point that the fiscal space is extremely low for budget 2018.  Potentially, the figure is as low as &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million.  Reference has been made to new measures.  In the context of a growing population and price pressures and so on, arguably these factors are not fully knitted in to the figures.<\/p> <p>  Short of changing the rules, to increase capital spending we are going to have to cut current spending - already the levels will not provide improvements in 2018 - or increase taxes.  That is really it.  In future years, we could increase capital spending perhaps by putting less money into the rainy day fund or perhaps by using the rainy day fund as a supplementary form of capital spending.  It would be a counter-cyclical measure used to spend more during recessions and less during booms.

That ranges across agri-food, chemical-pharma and wood, to name a few.  More accurately there are about 209,000 jobs in the sector, and with ancillary jobs on top of that the figure is nearer to 300,000.  Taking the whole services sector into account we are talking about 600,000 to 700,000 jobs.  We can then look at the import and export business that is done with the UK.  In 2015, the CSO figures showed an export level of about &euro;13.7 billion and an import level of about &euro;16.4 billion.  That gives a round figure of approximately &euro;30 billion between the two countries.  The point that we have made consistently at any of the consultations that we have been invited to is that all of these jobs are underpinned by the business that these companies do domestically and abroad.  If one plucks out that &euro;30 billion export trade business with the UK we believe that any trade barrier put in place in the absence of any agreement between either the EU and the UK or a specific agreement between Ireland and the UK - we do not know what will come out of these negotiations - could have very serious consequences for those jobs.  It is probably inappropriate to say that if our trade drops by 5% then we will lose 5% of jobs.  That is probably too course a mechanism to use.

I am a bit worried about that because I believe that the negotiations are going to start fairly quickly.  I have spent most of my life negotiating and I know that one usually has to get oneself ready fairly quickly for going into negotiations of that size.<\/p> <p>  Another thing that concerns me is that we set out our view at the session about jobs and enterprise in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.  I attended the second panel and contributed on it.  The policy position outlined by the Government representatives was that there are rules in Europe, particularly state aid rules, which would not allow any subventions or otherwise if the effect of Brexit is that people lose their jobs.  I said that there surely must be some level of subvention to help companies to transition and to be given a period of time to find diversified markets.  The answer was that Europe is based on these rules and that therefore there cannot be anti-competitive subvention.  My point on that is that we are in a unique scenario here.  We cannot stand by and have thousands of workers and their families lose their livelihoods, and we cannot allow ourselves to be hoisted on the petard of EU rules.  We should be clever and come up with something which preserves those rules and allows us to do something else.  <\/p> <p>  I got not sense that people who are going to be in these negotiating rooms would look for this, which worries me.  I am sharing here what I have already shared publicly.  I try and see these things in simple terms, because there is huge potential to get involved in very long-winded discussions relating to Brexit.  The executive of congress made a decision that we become very focussed on what it is we want to protect.  We agree with the common travel area and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  We agree that the Northern Ireland scenario is unique and that there should be no hard Border.  We are very clear on that, but we are focussing, in our discussions with anybody who will listen, on the protection of the jobs of our members North and South of the Border. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary also asked about employment rights, and I will briefly refer to it.  There is a strong possibility that when we get into the dogfight regarding trading with our nearest neighbour there will be companies who will try hard to maintain their trade.  That is understandable.  They want to preserve their business.  As time moves on the UK intends to leave the European Convention on Human Rights and has introduced its Great Repeal Bill.  It will pick and choose the legislation it maintains in terms of workers' rights and social rights.<\/p><p>If Ireland, and particular companies, are to maintain a trading relationship between the two countries we may have to match what is happening in the UK.  If that does not match the terms and conditions we have here then companies will start to push under the heading of competitiveness, which is a word that dogs me every day because it is a code for a lot things, including diminishing terms and conditions of workers.  The view then will be that particular companies will only be able to continue in operation if the terms and conditions here match the trading circumstances in the UK.  That is what I call the race to the bottom element of employment rights.  I have raised this issue in several arenas, including an august select body of the House of Lords, which took place in Buswells Hotel.  The employers bodies, of which there are a number, are not opposing what we are saying but they are not saying that it will not happen.  Over the last nine months since the Brexit announcement was made, I have heard particular companies in this country say that we will have to match what is happening in the UK.  That is scary for workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Since Brexit was announced there has been one substantial announcement of a significant employer in the North planning to move operations to the South.

I have not heard any commentator speak about Brexit in relation to the race to the bottom argument, which I accept is a legitimate issue to raise.   In other words, I have not heard comment to the effect that because the UK will not be in the European Union and will no longer be a party to the convention on human rights, we will return to a very historic relationship between employers and employees in the UK.

Our judgment is that the companies concerned will locate, in the main, in one or two areas, possibly Dublin and Cork.  There is reason to believe that those jobs will be what we would determine as commuter jobs in that people will work in Dublin Monday to Friday and return home to the UK at weekends and so on.  Child care services and housing infrastructure around the Dublin area is so bad that there are issues around whether all of the jobs that could transpire will do so.  That is another matter.  The jobs in the financial services sector will be, most likely, at the high paid end of the business.  In terms of mobility, the jobs that move are the bonus related positions and so on.  The high tech jobs are also more likely to be in at the higher end of the payscale.<\/p> <p>  The agrifood sector is regionally based.  As members will be aware, it is closely linked to the live supply from agriculture, such that a definitive characteristic of this will be how that will be dealt with.  I am not sure that farmers will be as badly affected because they have a much broader export market than the UK.  In the last number of years, they have been diversifying a lot.  In terms of retail, Ireland imports a considerable amount from the UK and this causes significant job creation here.  Any impediment or turbulence in the market could affect that.<\/p> <p>  It is going to take longer for all of this to happen, but within a period of five to seven years, unless this is managed very tightly there is a strong possibility of a huge job loss scenario.  We need to find a way through the EU negotiations to deal with this.  The State agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland, have been advising on transitionary circumstances and how to diversify.  They do not believe that funding is of any use in this regard.  We need to teach people how to diversify and to get companies to diversify their markets.  Diversifying markets takes time.  What does one do in the interregnum?  What happens to the jobs?  I am happy to say that a huge amount of the jobs about which we are speaking today are jobs, collectively bargained, and with decent enough rates of pay and conditions.

Notwithstanding any impact on agrifood, goods trade in food and live animals to Great Britain was down &euro;217 million, or 5.5%, in 2016, which is quite significant.  If one strips out machinery and transport equipment, goods trade with the UK was down only 1% in 2016.  NERI is tasked with identifying major swings one way or the other.  Because there is so much uncertainty associated with the upcoming negotiations, it is difficult for somebody like me to make hard forecasts in terms of what is likely to happen.  It is difficult to foresee anything other than an extremely hard Brexit.  The negotiations are likely to fail and go badly.  As that happens, which will be, probably, in late 2017 to early 2018, we will start to see an impact on the economy.  If the trade barriers go up in 2019, as appears likely, that is what I would identify as the most risky in terms of a potentially large negative shock to the economy, as a level effect.  It should not affect growth levels in subsequent years but there could be a fall in that one year and there could be chaos for Irish exporters for a period as the uncertainty continues and new markets are sought.<\/p> <p>  The increased uncertainty associated with all of this is a disincentive to investment because companies cannot be assured about access to markets and so on.

From our perspective, we argue that there should be a holistic approach to planning the development of towns, etc.  Clearly, there are severe problems for workers, even in commuting, how they get to work and where work is located.  That has significant social impact and even physical and mental impact in terms of workers commuting for hours to a workplace and then having to do the same to get home.  There are also all the issues and fallout from that.  Any of the discussions I have taken part in - as I stated, we have had one meeting so far - have been about building holistic communities with health services, hospital services, education services and communities rather than having only low paying jobs available in a particular community and people having to travel further, for instance, to the city, if they want to earn better money.<\/p> <p>  When we are building communities, suburbs or whatever of Waterford, Galway and Limerick, which cities were mentioned as ones that could be expanded, we must have quality housing and we must make plans for that housing to be available for all who need it.  In fairness, a number of sectoral groups, such as Engineers Ireland and Architects Ireland, have quite progressive comments to make about how one does that.  We are not experts in how towns are built, but what people want is to be able to live within a reasonable distance of their workplace, have relatively easy access to schools, health services, and so forth, and to develop a good community around them.  Getting up at 5 a.m. to be at a desk for 9 a.m. and leaving work at 4.30 p.m. to get on a train and not getting home until the children are in bed asleep has been the pattern that has developed over the past 20 years.  As one who has been for years a victim of the N11, I would say I know every leaf on every tree on the way in because that is what one does as one sits for hours in traffic.<\/p> <p>  We would argue strongly that agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have a big role to play in that conversation.  We argue that because their job is to attract industry to Ireland.  We believe they should do that on the basis of decently paid jobs located in line with that framework.  This should all be joined-up thinking.  As I said, the conversation is at an early stage.  We will argue that we deal with ordinary people who want to lead a good quality of life in a community which has an emphasis not only on work but also on leisure and in which the amenities are available to everybody.  We will argue that we do not make the mistakes we made previously where we built low quality housing for people because we think they are working class.  I grew up with those mistakes.  I saw that all around me.  We should have a much more innovative, equal way of dealing with society in order that people can at least aspire to enjoy a decent living in the community or town in which they live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>The NERI will make a submission to the planning framework review.

The process begins by looking at what we think will happen to the populations in the various areas and, looking at it from an economic point of view, identifying a small number of regional hubs to act essentially as champion urban areas - Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and probably two others - where a disproportionate amount of the resources should go with the goal of encouraging and coaxing people to move to these urban areas.  The process begins by completing the network that links Dublin to all the regional areas, including the north west which is currently isolated and is likely to become even more isolated after 2019.  Alongside that, the process begins by linking the regions to each other.  Waterford through to Cork, Limerick, Galway and up to Sligo and Letterkenny should be completed as a motorway network.

We have the potential to move ahead of the curve in a number of areas of scientific and technology development if we had such investment.  Developing medicines is another area.

By this, I mean the deep dissatisfaction with the inequalities created by globalisation, for which the EU bears much of the responsibility as it pushed a neoliberal globalisation agenda that has helped to produce inequality.  Where this feeds into much more specific problems is the whole area of increasingly unequal distribution of wealth.  We need to discuss this issue more as budgets approach because we often hear about the nuts and bolts and nothing of the overall trajectory we are trying to achieve.  People like Thomas Piketty have drawn a picture of this for us.

The left and trade union movement need to talk about closing this gap and using tax as a mechanism to redistribute wealth.

We and others have been in despair at the failure to address the housing emergency.  Much of the discussion focuses on financing housing construction and the narrative from the Government is that loads of money is available.  This begs the question as to why social housing is not being delivered at a faster rate.  While finance is important, the discussion needs to move on.  If, as the Government claims, there is substantial money available from the European Investment Bank, credit unions and so forth, what is the problem?  Does Ms King agree that a large part of the problem is that Governments have moved away from the old method of delivering public housing via direct construction by local authorities and that, in addressing a social housing problem, they insist on involving the private sector, which causes all sorts of delays, problems, trade-offs that hamper the delivery of public housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#J00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Perhaps we will ask Ms King to respond before proceeding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#J00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the diversification of industry.

This came up briefly at the Carrick-on-Shannon consultation on Brexit where one of the contributors on the panel, who represented an employer group, made the point that farmers must think about switching to forestry and so on.  While there is nothing wrong with aspiring to make such a switch, if a farmer's job is to rear 50 head of cattle and bring them for slaughter to the local factory and Brexit creates an impediment or trade barrier which prevents the factory from selling the meat, he will be left with 50 head of cattle.  There is no point in telling him to consider planting trees as there is a timeframe involved.  The farmer must earn a living and if he is not rearing 50 cattle for a factory and wishes to make money from forestry, he will need a plan and timeframe for diversification if he is to do so.

While it is a very good idea to diversify, people must be given a pathway to enable them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#J00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>State aid rules may be cited as an impediment to achieving this outcome but we must get beyond that in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  My final point on this issue encompasses some of the other issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p><p>During the financial crisis, we were in Europe.  One of my concerns is that Europe put its foot on Ireland's neck and told us not to burn the bondholders because it set the rules and we had to do things its way.  Those of us who lost pay, pensions or, unfortunately, jobs knew what that meant - we would be sacrificed.  If it was done once, it can be done twice.<\/p><p> My next point is for whoever will lead these negotiations on Ireland's behalf.  There will be bright and brilliant European people involved, but if their main aim is to protect the European model, they will not worry about the man with 50 head of cattle in Leitrim any more than they did when making rules on fiscal Europe.  Speaking as someone who has engaged in complex negotiations for years, the Irish negotiating team must get into Mr. Barnier's head, tell him what we want out of this and let it be known that, if we do not get it, we will veto the decision.  We cannot just accept that these jobs are going to go.  It is a simple point and people might dismiss its simplicity, but I am making that comparison.  We have had experience of Europe.  Let us face it - social Europe has been gone for ten or 15 years.<\/p><p> I represented workers in the arts and culture sector for years.  It is one of the lowest-paid sectors in our economy.  That is terrible.  We have been fighting for 12 years to get legislation through on collective bargaining rights for workers in that sector, which might be a reflection of how people view it.<\/p><p> I might not have answered all of Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s questions as fully as he wanted, but I will comment on housing.  The familiar statistics and charts tell their own story about local authorities pulling out of housing but we need to get right the issue of land, its price and what developers are doing with it.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, a body that I am attached to on behalf of ICTU, has done good work.  Those who read that work will get a good exposition of the situation as regards land and its price.  Every area&rsquo;s representative bodies have come up with good stats on the cost of land as a component of building ordinary, semi-detached, three-bedroom houses.  It is in the range of &euro;45,000.  We are told that 27,000 planning permissions are ready, but why are they not being executed?  It is because of an ongoing row.  We do not hear of it verbally, but there is an issue with the availability of land.  That land is the base price component of housing and the cause of much of its cost thereafter.<\/p><p> The private sector goes into business to make a profit.  That is understandable.  The private sector is seeking housing incentive packages from policy makers, for example, 9% VAT.  Since the Kenny report, land in Ireland has accumulated a large amount of betterment that the public has not benefitted from but from which developers have.  That is wrong.<\/p><p> The Deputy might not have read about it but we have argued that there should be compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, on land.  A CPO can be applied on a route from Cork to Dublin, but what is more important than housing people?  This is the social housing point of view but CPOs should also be considered in respect of vacant properties.  We understand property rights, courts and everything else but it might be possible to make this process work and allow the State to take over after a certain time.<\/p><p> There must be strong State involvement.  The State should start providing houses, as it used to do previously.  Some of us grew up in them and know them well.  The land issue, which is not often debated, needs to be dealt with and the price of that component of housing should be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Does Dr. McDonnell wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#K00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I agree that the economy needs to be diversified.

We have geographic disadvantages, of course.<\/p> <p>  To do what the Deputy has described is more of a medium-term project.  He was right to say that state aid rules make it difficult.  The Asian tigers pursued a developmentalist model whereby they championed particular sectors and industries.  They did this by being entrepreneurial states, that is, doing it themselves or by identifying champion companies.  The semi-States are the closest equivalent in Ireland.  They also subsidised particular industries and sectors.<\/p> <p>  If we want to convert much of the landscape from cattle to forestry, we will have to change the underlying economics to incentivise individuals.  That would mean subsidies for forestry and the gradual rolling back of CAP.  Forestry is capital intensive, there are upfront costs and income streams are not great.  It is a big risk to take.<\/p> <p>  Regarding disillusionment, people need hope and a sense of the potential for progress.  There has been an increase, at least since 1980, in the wealth distribution gap.  Much of the inequality in wealth is intergenerational, that is, certain people have inherited wealth rather than earned it.  Therefore, the policy solution is to nip it in the bud, which means a strong inheritance and gift tax that redistributes at that point with the money being, for example, hypothecated for social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#K00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Everyone else got a supplementary question.

Even in the private sector, the recent Morgan McKinley report stated that the gap was 16%, although another narrative has that at 14%.  There should be no gap.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of contributing factors.  Child care is a major factor in people, particularly women, being debarred from the workforce and from developing and utilising their skills.  If they have children during their careers, they are penalised in the labour market for that period.  Consider also the rates at which men and women progress.<\/p><p>All of that would indicate that if, as I have done myself, one has reared children, that is not going to be a help in one's career.  We have got to change a lot of attitudes.  For example, though I will not say that it will solve all of the problems, I would advocate one of the things that is being proposed, even in the UK, which is that companies with more than 250 employees would have to show their statistics on the gender pay gap, how women are not progressing and related matters.  That sort of name and shame stuff starts to build awareness and actually gets people to acknowledge that there is an issue and a problem.<\/p><p> We could have a much longer conversation about this.  I saw recent CSO figures on employment levels in the Irish economy for 2016.  They said there were 1.06 million males working in the economy and 895,000 females.  There was a little piece in it in respect of those who are engaged in home care duties.  They registered 10,000 men engaged in home care duties for 2016 and 435,000 women.  That in itself paints a picture.  The only good thing about it was that I looked at the 2014 figures and there were 465,000 women in 2014 so it is going in the right direction.<\/p><p> There is a whole big picture that we certainly do not have time to discuss but it is unacceptable.  Policy-makers, in our judgment, should spend some time working with those of us who are trying to get rid of that inequality in the system.  To me, there is not lot of engagement on it.  There is in particular areas, but it is seen as specific problem rather than an overall labour market issue.<\/p><p> On the issue of the various different grades in the public service, our judgment has been, as the committee will know, these were cuts that were imposed.  We tried to mitigate as far as we could and we only got so far in the Haddington Road agreement.  I was engaged in that myself so I am fairly familiar with it.  We have asked the public service pay commission to look at this because I have been on record several times in 2016 saying that different rates of pay are untenable and cause all sorts of internal friction, regardless of whether one is in the private or public sector.  Whoever dreamt them up, they should not have passed the test on human resources never mind trade unionism. They are, in my judgment, a long-drawn-out problem which ultimately leads people to see an inequity in the system.  They should not have been imposed in the period of austerity.  We have asked the commission to consider and address it in an ongoing way, apart from the disputes that people are legitimately involved in to try to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms King.  I appreciate that she has been here a long time already so I will just go back to what we are about.  We are looking at the review of the capital programme and so I would like to ask Ms King a couple of direct questions about what she would support in the review.<\/p> <p>  Bearing in mind the comments that she has already made about supporting a regional report, would she broadly support the completion of the motorway system that was undertaken at the height of the boom?  I refer, in particular, to the N4 to Sligo, which remains unfinished.  Would she also support the notion of the Atlantic corridor?  Would she support the notion of developing a contact like the road from Limerick, for example, to Kerry; to Tralee and Killarney, but also the road from Limerick to Cork?  There are a lot of people employed in that region in pharma, which Ms King referenced already, but also in agriculture and food processing.  We have to make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance and, while roads would not necessarily be the first priority, the most dangerous thing of all is to have a half-finished road where people exit from a full motorway system because this can cause a tremendous number of accidents.  I think we know about those.  That is one question.<\/p> <p>  I know congress has been involved in respect of the subject matter of my second question for a long time.  I was both angry and shocked by a statement and interviews in the media in the past couple of days by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the effect that he is giving the nod, very strongly, to a third terminal at Dublin Airport which he envisages would possibly be privately-owned.  I know congress is not necessarily part of a formal partnership, but I find that notion coming from a member of the Government at this point extraordinary.  There was a lot of public money invested in the second terminal.  While business at Dublin Airport is growing, my understanding is that there is still capacity there.  More importantly, airports are strategic national assets.  In the context of the development plan, would ICTU share the view that assets like airports, which are publicly-owned in this country, should continue to be publicly-owned in terms of their development?  I do not know if ICTU has a position on it, but certainly earlier Ms King was talking about various races to the bottom.  I see all the signs of that in the proposal for a third, privately-owned, terminal at Dublin Airport at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of upskilling of people for potential job changes, does ICTU have any view?  Ms King probably has more insight into it than many of us.  When I was in government, and particularly when I was the T&aacute;naiste, I worked very hard to get the apprenticeship programme started again in public organisations such as the ESB.  The organisations in question did restart it.  I am really shocked that, notwithstanding the development of SOLAS, the numbers taking up apprenticeships are very small.  Does ICTU have a view as to how that might be improved?  We know that more than 55% of people leaving secondary school are going on to some form of third-level, higher or further education.  However, many of the remainder would be interested in apprenticeships.  There are very few opportunities being offered to them and I would be quite fearful of those young people falling behind.  The number of women apprentices also remains depressingly low.  The German and Austrian models, in which there is very strong employer buy-in to sponsoring apprenticeships, offer us a very good model for providing really good opportunities for young people.<\/p> <p>  In the context of previous discussions on housing, does ICTU have a position on affordable housing?  There are many young people employed in the public service and other employments, as the Secretary General of ICTU pointed out.  Many of them have now been in employment for eight to ten years.  They may want to buy a house on their own, they may be in a relationship, they may have started a family.  In the housing debate, my view is that affordable housing is important, particularly for younger people or, perhaps, for older people where there has been a split in a relationship and where the person who is leaving the family home will have to find another home.  A large number of the people affected by that are generally men, perhaps in their 50s.  In terms of its conversation with Government, does ICTU have a position, not just on ending homelessness on which I think there is universal agreement, but on affordable housing, which is a key starter fact for a lot of young people who are working and who, with loan support and access to credit, would be able to take it up?  It just seems to have fallen out of the picture almost completely.<\/p><p> Will the delegation tell us more about what effectively is a strike by developers and builders when it comes to building housing?  Perhaps Dr. McDonnell has a view on that.  The number of housing starts is appallingly small.  Do the witnesses have an idea for a mechanism to solve the problem?  There will be a minimum additional inflow or availability of capital funds of an extra &euro;2.5 billion in terms of the review.  Does congress have ideas about what would be best value in terms of that additionality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#L00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked many questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#M00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Yes, I will leave it at that but I make two other points about Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#M00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I sit on the board of the Dublin Airport Authority, so I will not say anything that is in appropriate in that regard.

As the Deputy will know, if a national apprenticeship is offered, the skills level must be thorough.  Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, must underpin everything, and rightly so.  If somebody claims they have been through an apprenticeship as an electrician or commis chef, we want them to be a fully qualified electrician or commis chef.  The process is more complex than anybody on the council envisaged.  A lot of hard work is going on in a variety of areas.  The council put out a call for apprenticeships and received responses from employer groups which were prepared to sponsor.  Some of those were oven ready, so to speak, some needed more work and some were way off.  There are three lots.  The council is making another call because some key groups did not come forward in the first phase.  One such example is child care.  I have argued strongly that an apprenticeship training scheme in child care is necessary, progressive and good.  I hope that the child care community come back on that.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of another area that I believe would drive up numbers, there is an established grade in the health sector called health care assistant which, in my judgment, would be very positive, and I have contributed this at the Apprenticeship Council of Ireland.  There are thousands of people working at that grade in the HSE alone, apart from the private employers and so on in the health services.  If we were to get such an employer interested in taking up that on the apprenticeship scheme, which, as the Deputy rightly said in her contribution to the employers when they attended the committee, which I read, is a combination of the German-Austrian model.  It is work-based and classroom-based training.  That would drive up the numbers greatly, but it would not just be about driving up numbers but also about getting a good, strong practical training standard at that grade level in the health sector.<\/p> <p>  The calls have been made and a lot of hard work is going on with apprenticeships.  The target is 31,000 places.  If we were to succeed in getting key apprenticeships in those sorts of areas, it would be much easier to achieve the gender balance.  I am heartened by the level of work that is going on to develop apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  The council has discussed getting involved with and having conversations with the Central Applications Office in order that these are real offers and that when young people coming up to the leaving certificate are making decisions with their parents about what courses they are going to take, apprenticeships outside of the construction sector are real options for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>All of the committee members would agree that this is what should happen.

My colleagues are working on a paper, which is currently out for external review, so I do not wish to comment too much to pre-empt that, but it is possible to finance this within the public sector, although, of course, not the entirety of the annual need.  To do so will require up to &euro;2 billion per year to generate 10,000 housing units.  My expectation is that what we are seeing is a lag and that the evident demand that exists, particularly in Dublin, will be met with increasing private sector supply.  With house prices continuously increasing it simply makes more sense to do so.  I anticipate that private sector building will increase, and also on the commercial side.<\/p><p> There is a competitiveness aspect to this as well.  Rising rents, mortgages and so forth will have to be reflected ultimately in increasing wages just to stand still, and obviously there is a competitiveness aspect to that.  Of course, if we want to get those 50,000 London jobs, for which we, Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and other places are fighting, that means there must be a quality of life within the city.  That means we must deal with the housing so the State is essentially building the place to which they can come, \"Field of Dreams\" style.  In addition, Patricia King has repeatedly referred to the child care issue.  That is a major issue for quality of life in Dublin as well.<\/p><p> The State must take a far more substantial role, and the envelope that has been identified and suggested by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of capital needs is clearly insufficient out to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>During the debate on NAMA, I proposed the social investment clause which the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, accepted.  It was one of the few changes a Minister for Finance ever accepted in anything.  I am disappointed it has not worked out or been utilised more.  However, there is something that might be helpful to the committee or to Ireland in general.  Patricia King referred to NESC on a number of occasions.  If it was possible for an opinion to be published again by such a body setting out those proposals regarding mixed models of funding and so forth, it might be very useful to do it now.  Certainly, there is a strong perception of huge inhibitions because of the rules referred to earlier on state aid and the structure on which NAMA was based suddenly coming in for later attack.  In fact, there have been suggestions in the public media by a group of developers that they are contesting even the current NAMA housing section on the principle that it constitutes an unfair state aid.  If there was advice through ICTU or NESC that was strong and robust, it might give the Government more courage in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I was delighted to hear Dr. McDonnell mention the Maynooth line.  The electrification of the Maynooth line in the current plan is not sufficiently prioritised in my view.  In terms of product, that is the one that will produce the greatest commuter benefit and has the highest potential to reduce private car flow into Dublin.  There have been a number of positive developments, such as the line up to Broombridge and the opening of the tunnel under the Phoenix Park, but the electrification is being long-fingered now.  Does ICTU have a view on that development?  The west side of Dublin, like Fingal, is the key population development area for the future and the electrification of that line would accelerate the trains, particularly if it was carried out far down on the line.<\/p> <p>  I have a final question.  In the context of the challenges facing Ireland with Brexit, do the witnesses think it is possible, perhaps using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a model, to make a proposal for a compensation fund for Ireland in respect of the costs that will arise from Brexit and the re-adjustments, re-alignments and so forth that will have to be made?  ICTU is part of the European Trade Union Confederation.  The fiscal stability rules were set by Germany quite a long time ago but the EU does not appear to have found a satisfactory mechanism for change up to now.  When one talks to people privately they are quite open to change but no mechanism has been found yet.  Are there ideas in the European trade union movement as to what the mechanism would be?  The Italians want to invest more capital and for that not to count as part of the deficit.  There are many other examples.  Greece would like to do that and it would make a great deal of sense.  From the witnesses' wider international contacts do they see any model which, perhaps, the committee might put forward to the Government as a means of getting over this huge inhibition relating to the fiscal rules?  I have met Andrew McDowell, as I am sure the witnesses have, who was formerly the adviser to the Taoiseach and is now the European Investment Bank's representative to Ireland.  He is dying to spend money and we are dying to receive it, but we do not seem to be able to bridge the gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#N00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>On the last question, I would not say he is dying to meet us to talk about it.

We became very aware of it in the Dell situation when all those jobs were lost.  We should not pre-accept that there will be huge job losses.

I had to put a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I will have to leave again soon.  We do a great deal of multi-tasking here.  I wish to pick up on the question asked by Deputy Burton relating to the national planning framework.  The committee received a submission from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, on 8 February last which I believe was spectacular in the lack of sustainable thinking displayed.<\/p><p>IBEC connected its submission to the national planning framework and gave a presentation on it again this morning to Oireachtas Members.  It was more motorways and dual carriageways everywhere with thousands of kilometres more of motorways.  They said we must finish our 20th-century solutions before we start looking at 21st-century solutions.  I could not believe it because we are one of only two states that will not meet its climate targets in Europe and we are one of four states not meeting renewable targets.  If one drives out on the N7 in the morning there are tens of thousands of people stuck in traffic jams and all these union members are spending an extra two hours per day getting to and from work.  This is a huge imposition on the quality and the cost of work.<\/p><p> I am slightly nervous as Deputy Burton seems to be talking up motorways to Sligo and from Cork to Limerick.  For four decades we have sprawled, and we have sprawled spectacularly, because we have spent four to one on roads versus public transport.  Everything in my political antenna says that we are being set up for the same thing again.  Pretty much every Deputy from around the country is going to say that they want motorways everywhere and that they must have dual carriageways here, there and everywhere.  The numbers are going to be stacked up on that.  I do not know what but it will take something to try to change our ways to bring development back to the centre.  It is part of the corruption of land and land pricing that Ms King spoke of earlier.  We must radically change our development process.  The planning experts know that and have said that but everything I hear is the opposite; we are just going to keep building more and more roads and sprawl further out.<\/p><p> We have had a very good experience in recent years of talking with ICTU and other trade unions on the ideas around just transition, a recognition that the jobs are going to come to the centre, in sustainable solutions and in efficient high-tech clean industries.  That is where the economic future is.  Our country has no interest in it, our political and public systems have no understanding of that and we are going to miss the opportunity.  I plead with ICTU as it has an interest in just transition.  Maybe it could use its voice to say funding should be spent on public transport first on this occasion.  It will not advantage workers to be stuck in yet longer traffic jams.  Galway's issues will not be solved by another outer ring road at &euro;600 million.  If we put that amount into some decent public transport solutions in Galway we might start to see the city really develop with further jobs.  It is a fantastic city but it is about to gridlock and no amount of roads will solve that problem.  The only way to solve it is with proper public transport and planning but we are not doing that.  I was slightly worried when Dr. McDonnell listed off about a half a dozen other projects.  This would eat up the entire capital freedom we have, we would not have the public transport and we would be another decade or two going towards unsustainable sprawl the direction in which, God help us, IBEC wants to drive us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#N00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487772000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I consider that the main point is that the capital budget as outlined by the Minister is wholly insufficient.  I identified those roads - as the Deputy said - but I also made the point at least twice already that I believed public transport to be just as important.  The Deputy is correct that Galway's problems are internal to the city and I made that point also.  Deputy Ryan is right that it is a great city but it is extremely hard to go anywhere after 3.30 p.m. and one does not get into the car between then and 7 p.m. as traffic will not be moving.  Public transport must be the answer for that city, as it is for Dublin.  That goes beyond buses and involves further extensions for Luas and light rail and ultimately linking up all of Dublin city.  The same goes for Cork, Limerick and other urban spaces that are large enough to do that.<\/p> <p>  Housing policy must look at putting people into the centre of cities.  There may be implications for maximum heights for buildings which I know is not necessarily liked by the Green movement but there is a debate to be had there.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the just transition, the Deputy is right.  We are going to have to do it anyway and perhaps a commitment to climate change targets is one area where there could be a sense of European purpose to come out of the Council meetings in March.  Green infrastructure throughout the EU, with the ultimate aim of becoming completely sufficient in renewables, is something that NERI and ICTU would completely support.  Obviously there would have to be transition mechanisms to deal with workers who are in the polluting industries and that applies also to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to potential for a globalisation fund.  Although I would associate that with Brexit, in this case it would be a de-globalisation fund.  Ms King responded that the goal should simply be to keep those businesses going and tapered subsidies were suggested.  There will need to be some mechanism in place, some kind of EU fund to deal with the industries that will go down because of these measures.  It must be a combination of both.  NERI is currently working on developing an enterprise policy for Ireland that would apply at a European level also.  I assure Deputy Ryan that the green economy is very much central to that policy. <\/p> <p>  As for the planning framework review, the emphasis must be on the cities and in getting people to move to the cities.  That, however, will create what would be perceived as losing regions.  Ultimately, that is where our analysis would lead us.  The perception will be that if one focuses on Limerick, Cork, Galway and Dublin, then all the areas that are not mentioned are immediately going to kill their view because they would be seen as the losers.  The importance of a motorway network and rural broadband is that they ensure other regions of the country are not isolated from the economic hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1487772000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Whatever about Kilkenny and the other cities we need to develop, Dublin will not have any big public transport projects for ten years.  There is no budget for the interim solution for providing for bus, cycle and walkways.  There are no plans for Galway, Cork or Limerick.  There are no plans for Kilkenny other than to build more roads in the city centre.  We are in a bit of a crisis on the planning front and while we need higher density centres, there is no point in having the higher density unless there is public transport because it is the only way to service the higher density population centres.  When economists assess a scheme, they will look at the cost-benefit analysis of a road and they love it because it will show all the figures.  Yet, they cannot do an economic analysis that shows the benefit of planning for better, sustainable transport options; the social and societal benefits we get from having land use and transport planning done together.  I wish to flag this slight crisis in our cities because they are starting to gridlock as the economy grows at 5% per annum.  My city is going to gridlock and it needs radical change in investment in public transport and emergency funding.  There is nothing in the current budget.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is brilliant at spending and the reason the construction industry loves public private partnerships is because the industry knows how to do them and roll them out.  We have done nothing but motorways in the last 20 or 30 years, other than a couple of Luas lines.  The construction industry loves it, those companies know how to do it, they get money for it and it will all be done.  If that scale and urgency of investment went into public transport in all our cities, it would benefit the regions.

This attraction would be based on the lowest possible wages and conditions and the public transport provider who is trying to offer a better rate of pay and a wage, gets knocked off the market because it cannot compete with the lower-cost operator.

This request is neither a matter of public concern in relation to legislative powers <i>per se<\/i>nor a matter of public policy.  Therefore, is not admissible under Standing Order 111B(1) or Standing Order 111C(1)(a).  It also requests D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to manage the diary of the Taoiseach of the day when he or she receives an invitation to attend an event somewhere, which is something it does not have the power to do under Standing Order 111C(1)(b).  It is proposed to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Orders 111B(1) and 111C(1).  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>As there is no further business, the committee stands adjourned until Wednesday, 8 March 2017, when we will meet officials from the Citizens Information Board.

Years before the issue of cybersecurity was called that, it had been described to us by children through Childline.  It has emerged and evolved over time.  Without question, it is the child protection issue of our time.  This is a dramatic statement to make, but we do not make it without the evidence to support it.<\/p> <p>  We separate the issue of technology from access to the Internet and social media.  Access to technology is important for children and young people.  It is an educational and networking tool and can help to keep them safe.  For example, Childline is a form of technology that helps to keep children safe.  Our view is not that technology is a bad thing, but we need to distinguish between technology and access to technology from access to the Internet and social media.  Regulated and well-managed access to the Internet and social media can also be a useful tool so long as we understand the nature and impact of same and ensure that it is applied in an age appropriate way.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues have emerged and will probably be discussed often during this meeting.  For example, as technology has developed and become more complicated, so have the issues coming to us from children.  This is not a simple matter and the problems are not easy to describe, as is often the case with children.  My colleague, Ms O'Sullivan, who is the expert in our services area, will take the committee through the case studies and some work that we have been doing to understand the issues for children and young people.  The solutions are complex.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes, I worry that cybersafety and online safety are seen as being so much of an all-encompassing issue that we are in danger of putting it into the \"Too Difficult\" box.  It is not too difficult.  If we and policy makers begin thinking of it as too difficult, we will fail our children and young people.  We must find solutions and ways in which to keep children safe.  It is possible.<\/p> <p>  We will talk the committee through some of the work that we have done, including an important case review and an internal analysis of our case studies, so that it can understand the emerging themes and trends.  We have made some recommendations on legal and policy changes and education.<\/p> <p>  A distinction needs to be made between technology and use of the Internet and social media, but we also need to make a distinction between what is or should be illegal behaviour online and what is harmful behaviour.  Illegal behaviour is simpler to understand and define.  For example, the Law Reform Commission has stated that online stalking needs to be prescribed as an offence in law.  That would make it easier to detect and prosecute.  We agree with that recommendation.  Online harassment also needs to be a prosecutable offence.<\/p> <p>  Cyberbullying is a form of harmful behaviour.  Severe and malicious bullying that becomes harassment then becomes a form of illegal behaviour, but we need to understand the two separately.  If we do not, we are at risk of criminalising children and young people who often undertake actions online without understanding the consequences.  This is one of the issues that will arise at this meeting.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC is the national child protection charity.  We are probably best known for our Childline service, which is the national listening service.  We receive more than 400,000 contacts from children and young people annually, or approximately 1,200 per day.  In recent years, children have increasingly chosen online forms of communication to contact us.  At a particular age, children are increasingly comfortable disclosing some personal and sensitive issues online through our web chat service.  The fact that we have this technology available to us enables us to support and help children.  Our one-to-one child and family services, therapeutic services and many other services work with children who have been victims of crime or harmful behaviour towards them online.  Often, we work with these children, who have been traumatised in some shape or form and need help, for many months.<\/p> <p>  We undertook a piece of work last year in which we examined our caseload over a period to understand the emerging issues and the experiences of children and young people online.  This is outlined in section 3 of the report.  I will hand over to Ms O'Sullivan to talk the committee through it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I will provide a small bit of background.  The ISPCC has been around for a long time.  In the past ten to 15 years, we have noticed an increasing issue in case discussions when supervising our staff.<\/p><p>There always seem to have been some level of online risk or cybersafety issues occurring.  Children within our children's advisory committees would have been coming to us stating that there were a lot of issues for young people at present because they are getting involved in Snapchat and chat groups and they had serious concerns about the ability of young people to cope with what they were seeing in these social media sites.  It was all anecdotal in many ways but we had a gut feeling that there was something serious happening here that we needed to look at.  Childline was receiving thousands of contacts from children distressed because they had done or said something online or had taken photographs or whatever, and did not know what to do with this information.<\/p><p> Rather than merely going along with piecemeal information, a team of managers, staff, volunteers and members of the children's advisory committee decided to conduct a complete review of our case work over the 18 months up to June 2016.  The results from that are clear.  In over one third of the cases we worked with over that period, including calls to Childline, online contacts to Childline, the text services in Childline and our face-to-face therapeutic professional services that are delivered all over the country, there was some form of online risk to the children involved.   This is neither an urban issue nor a rural issue.  It is an issue for every child in every part of the country.<\/p><p> There were a number of themes that came out strongly within this case review.  The first one, not surprisingly, is cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying is as commonplace as bullying has ever been, but the way that it is being done has changed.  As I said, one third of our cases involved cyberbullying to some extent.  That would not have been the reason the child was referred to our service in the first place.  The child could have been referred for anxiety issues - not sleeping at night, not being able to cope with issues, difficulties in maintaining friendships and in some cases children who were self-harming or who had suicidal ideation.  These might have been the reasons we were getting the referrals but when one dug deep into those cases and looked at the rationale of why the children were experiencing this, online safety, cybersafety and the risks around being involved in the cyberworld form part of a third of the cases.  When one considers the number of children we are talking about here, that is significant.<\/p><p> Excessive time spent online was the second.  As I said, we looked at our cases.  We also looked at our support line, which is for parents.  The amount of time that children are spending online is hugely concerning, with young people spending up to five hours a day online.  When one considers a child's day, he or she gets up in the morning and goes to school, and some children will have after-school, and by the time they get home, it could be 6 p.m.  Yet they are spending five hours on average online.  What else are these children doing?  Where is their social interaction with the family?  Where is their ability to switch off?  It is a constant barrage of messages about how they look, how they should look, what they should be saying, who they should be going out with, what they should be doing and whether they are frigid or sluts - because it is one or the other.  Children are finding it difficult to establish their own sense of identity and what is good for them and to make decisions and choices that are best for them.<\/p><p> Parents are very concerned as well that children are up in their rooms.  They think their children are safe.  They have their phone, iPad or whatever technology, and they think they are safe.  In one of the cases within the document here, one parent came across a situation where she recognised that her child was being groomed by a paedophile ring and found that out through checking out and looking at the history and looking at whatever else.  Imagine the fright any parent would get when he or she sees or comes across something in regard to that and the impact that it has on the child.<\/p><p> Parents have talked to us about the level of time spent online.  Anybody here who is a parent of teenagers will know they will want to take their phone into the bedroom at night.  I have teenagers and they do not do have their phones in their bedrooms at night.  If one left that phone on, it is constant notifications throughout the night - at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.  Children are not getting sleep.  If children are not getting sleep, they will not be able to cope with what comes at them the next day.  We all know that sleep is a huge factor in terms of mental health.  One has to get enough sleep in order to be able to cope with whatever one's challenges.  Children are being woken up consistently during the night.  Parents are telling us that they wake up to the sound in their homes and their children are having full-scale voice conversations on some app at 3 a.m. and have been on for an hour.<\/p><p> There is this constant pressure on young people to be on all the time.  There is no time for just sitting on the couch and chatting anymore.  It is to be constantly on the social apps, constantly engaging and constantly trying to put across this image that they are better than they perceive themselves to be.  The big issue about this aspect is the fact that they do not think they are good enough, they do not think they are as good as everybody else and the constant streaming of information is adding to that level of anxiety.  These are children as young as nine, ten and 11.  One can imagine that level of pressure on a nine year old.<\/p><p> Children are getting technology a lot younger.  Even seven or eight years ago, it was children who had just done their confirmation, and they would use their confirmation money to buy phones.  Now it is communion money.  These are smart phones where children have access 24 hours a day to whatever content is available.  This was another big theme that showed up, the whole area of inappropriate content being accessed by young people.  Children are coming across this accidentally, they are seeing it by older friends in the same housing estate and then they themselves are seeking out that information.<\/p><p> Parents have told us that they apply parental controls.  That is great as it protects a child within the home.  However, it does not protect the child when he or she is accessing Wi-Fi out on the street, in another house, in a shopping centre or wherever else.  Those kind of controls in many ways give a false sense of security to parents because they think their children are safe and they do not have to be concerned.<\/p><p> Parents are completely unaware of how to keep their children safe.  There is a complete lack of knowledge and information, from their viewpoint.  They have this attitude in many ways that their children know it better than they do and there is absolutely no point in them becoming involved in this aspect.  There is a huge need for education around that for parents and children alike.<\/p><p> Sexting is a huge issue.  The biggest development that we have noticed in Childline and in all of our services is that this has become the norm rather than the exception.  The expectation is that if one is in any kind of relationship or one wants to have a relationship then one needs to take photographs of oneself and send them on to the partner, if one does not then there is something wrong with you, whereas if one does one can be so-called \"slut shamed\".  It is either end again - there is no pleasing anybody in terms of the actions that young people are taking.  Children are feeling pressurised to share self-generated images.  When we talk to children about this, they say, \"This is safe sex\".  Their attitudes have changed completely.  They describe this as a safe way of exploring their sexuality and safer than having sex.<\/p><p> It moves on then, from taking pictures to one of the other themes that we would have come across, that is, the area of sextortion or blackmailing of children.  One of our cases deals with a child of nine years of age who would have sent nude pictures of herself to the boys in her class.  It is not normal developmental behaviour for any nine year old child to do so but for her, on this particular occasion, that was what she thought would have been expected, and she would have been quite surprised at the reaction to it.  Children will take a picture.  They will send that to somebody they feel they can trust because they feel they have to do it.  Then they will be put under pressure to provide more content, be that more photographs, more explicit photographs or more videos.  Children in their teens are getting involved in this activity and the aftermath of that is horrific.  These photographs are being shared and put on Snapchat groups.  Children are being invited on to these groups so that they can be bullied while they are online in regard to it.  Other children are being excluded from all chat forums because they do not want them involved anymore.  It is extremely difficult for children to be able to cope with what is going on around them.  They have absolutely no control over it.  They feel they have no control.  They have no knowledge or capability to deal with the aftermath of what has occurred.  For them, initially, it was just sending a photograph, thinking, \"What is the harm?\"  It is because they are children.<\/p><p> Online grooming is another area we are very concerned about.  Grooming in the past was very much around face-to-face grooming.  A person who wanted to cause harm would get involved and get acquainted with the child's family and the parents were being groomed in the same way as the child.  The person built up that trusting relationship.  Adding on the cyberworld to that, it makes it a lot easier for predators to seek out children and groom a lot quicker.  We held a cyber-conference recently at which the Garda presented where it said it can be as quick as three-to-four interactions with a child when the grooming takes place.  In many ways, we have to be scared of that.<\/p><p> We have to be scared that children are at risk here.  Children do not have the cognitive development or the critical thinking at younger ages to be able to work through this.  That is why we need policies to change.  We need legislation to change so that we can protect children and on the other hand, have a whole education piece for children, parents, schools, community groups and every professional who is working with children.<\/p><p>As regards online grooming cases, I already mentioned the child who had been groomed by a paedophile ring, but luckily the parent found out about that and was able to report it, act on it and the child was saved from it.  <\/p><p> As regards sextortion, we came across a case where two teenage girls met somebody online.  They did not know this \"boy\", as they thought, online and they sent some photographs of themselves in their underwear over the net.  Afterwards they were put under pressure because this material was going to be shared in public with their school friends and all the rest of it.  There was obvious distress involved in this.  When we were teenagers ourselves it was all about fitting in, being with one's peers, and having friends.  Teenagers get to a point where their parents become irrelevant and their whole focus is about what their peers think.  Much as we parents do not like to think we become irrelevant, we do.  What their peers say about them is hugely important.  Therefore, if a teenager has taken a picture and their peers turn against them, they will be facing difficulties immediately. <\/p><p> The other key area we came across was identity and well-being, which follows on from the point I was just making.  We validate ourselves as teenagers through our contact with our immediate family, relations and extended family.  They need good adults within their lives.  Cyber identity is forming a huge part in terms of children's development of their own identity, their view of self and the value they place on that.  Basically, therefore, we have added a whole new dimension to children's development.  We have to accept that children are living in an online world that is not always negative, as my colleague, Ms Long, has already pointed out.  We must be sure, however, that when children are online they are safe.  <\/p><p> As regards children's self esteem and self worth, in my 20 years with the ISPCC I have never seen as many cases where children's view of themselves is at rock bottom.  It is as if children cannot see one good characteristic about themselves because there are about 40 different messages that argue against them.  That is scary.  One will only be resilient enough to cope with difficulties if one believes that one is special, unique, worthwhile and has some people in life who will be there for support no matter what.  A person will not have any coping ability, however, if they do not believe they are worth something and have somebody they can trust to talk to.<\/p><p> That is why 24-hour services are so important.  In this country, the only 24-service for children is Childline, which is fantastic.  We are delighted to be able to provide it, but that is not good enough.  What if there is an immediate risk to a child who is in a situation where they need an immediate rescue?  At the moment such a case goes to the Garda.  The Garda has been amazing and we have a positive working relationship with it, yet Tusla has to have a responsibility in this area.  <\/p><p> Earlier I mentioned the lack of knowledge and skills, which applies to children as well as parents and professionals who work in this area.  The first step for all of us is to recognise that this is happening and that it is not a small percentage of children.  We all like to think that our own children are not involved in anything, that they are perfect and wonderful, but the reality is that every parent needs to open the lines of communication because every child is involved in social media in some shape, form or capacity, either with or without their parents' knowledge.  In the view of the ISPCC this is the child protection issue of our time.  Unless we act now we will have to deal with massive unsurmountable issues in future, whereas they could be surmounted now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Sullivan.

I attended the ISPCC conference and it was most enlightening.  One could nearly make a road-show of it.

Being a mother of three, I suppose I am up to speed on everything that has been said.  I am approaching this from the parents' angle in seeking to find how we can overcome these challenges.<\/p> <p>  Just after Christmas, the PSNI published 100 abbreviations they were experiencing in Northern Ireland.  Has the ISPCC had any engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do something similar?  I have telephoned the Garda but has the ISPCC also made a request in this regard?  While the PSNI is doing this in the North, parents in the South would like to see what are the top 100 three-letter analogues it is using.<\/p> <p>  What is the ISPCC's view on the use of mobile phones in schools?  Do the witnesses believe in time-out during the school day?  One Minister has said that he understands the need for such phones in the classroom so that students can check things, but I thought that was the role of the white board.  However, I would like to hear the ISPCC's view on the role of mobile phones in school.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the providers, such as Vodaphone, Eir, Samsung or iPhone, last summer I wanted to put a time-limit on the phone so that a child could only use it for an hour.  I wanted to set that limit on the phone's hard-drive.  That could be done on older version of mobile phones, but not on the newer models.  Has the ISPCC been in contact with any phone providers about this?  I compliment the Vodaphone network because one can change a password remotely, but parents are unaware that they can do so.  I can do it when I am up here or at home when my children have access to the phone from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.  That facility should be common knowledge, however, and be easily accessible to all.  Parents need help and support with such matters.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Sullivan was right to say that pressure is coming from peers, while the parent is seen as an oddball who has not got a clue.  In fact, however, parents need to hold on to that control.  If they have the controls to do so, we will be moving in the right direction but phone providers need to help parents also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#D00600","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and I am sorry I was late.

The ISPCC has recommended the establishment of the office of a digital safety commissioner and a policy and regulatory framework in its documentation.  The three witnesses have painted a worrying picture but they said there are solutions.  What should we do?  One measure is to educate children and  parents.  We need to provide solidarity for parents because children will say, \"Mary is allowed to do this.  Why don't you let me?  Mary takes her phone to bed.  Why can't I?\"  We must convey the message that it is right for parents to advise their child that he or she needs a night's sleep and not to take a phone to his or her bedroom.  The hard aspect is discerning what is illegal, what is damaging but is not illegal and identifying them.  We need to reach that point.  We have begun to identify elements.  I attended a conference on the subject.  The ISPCC has highlighted the issue, which is important.  The next step is to decide what to do and deal with the problem.  The ISPCC has suggested a digital safety commissioner.  Perhaps that is the way to go.  A dedicated office would provide a place for children, parents and everybody else to go and a commissioner would ensure something is done.<\/p> <p>  Technology keeps evolving.  How does one control cybersecurity?  How does one legally deal with the issues?  It was noted in the presentation that apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp, etc., can be manipulated.  I mean one child can change something that another child has typed in earlier in the chat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#E00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Can the app providers stop that from happening?

I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations.  They painted a scary picture.<\/p> <p>  The delegation mentioned a strategy and it was touched on by Senator Noone.  Who does the ISPCC believe should roll out the strategy?  Is it Tusla?  There is a question mark over whether people would have the confidence in Tusla to do such work.  Does the ISPCC want a digital safety commissioner to roll out the strategy?  There is no point having a strategy if there is no-one to implement it and roll it out.<\/p> <p>  What is the view of the ISPCC on parental responsibility?  Parents needs support.  Sometimes parents forgot their responsibilities in this modern age.  I do not see how anyone would think it acceptable for a communion age child to have a smartphone.  In reality many children of that age will have one but it is ridiculous.  Does the ISPCC favour a stronger legal remedy if one's child is found to have bullied a child online or using WhatsApp or whatever?  Would the ISPCC recommend imposing a penalty for such behaviour?  Parents would sit up and listen fairly fast if there was the risk of a penalty.  Education is needed but parents need to tell their child that he or she will not get a phone or use one for a certain period.  Parents tend to give into their children's demands too easily nowadays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#E00600","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will work my way through the questions and my colleagues will answer as well.  There are three key parts to our view of what a strategy would look like, which will probably cover all of the questions.<\/p> <p>  I cannot stress enough the importance of formal and informal education in solving this problem.  All of the members have mentioned in their comments that education is required for children, young people and parents.  I will start with children and young people.  To be blunt, our education curriculum does not prepare people for the outside world.  We are frankly naive as a society if we think that what we teach children about sex and sexual behaviour is enough to equip them.  The sooner we recognise that and it is reflected in our curriculum the better for children and child safety.  The national strategy needs to be owned by Government and rolled out by four key Departments.  The Department of Education and Skills would play a key role.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of educating children, the curriculum needs to reflect reality.  The technology aspect is best suited for a debate on a separate day.  There are whole groups of people who will argue the case for more children and particularly girls to study technology.  We also need, as part of our curriculum, to recognise the importance of educating young people about sex, sexual behaviour, and online behaviour.  The curriculum needs to do this work formally.  Other countries do this work as a matter of course.  This aspect does not form a sufficient part of our curriculum and we need to fix the situation.<\/p> <p>  As Ms O'Sullivan has said, a lot more can be done to build resilience.  There are national programmes available that will help to supplement and build resilience in children and young people.  I do not have a strong view one way or the other whether it is formal education in schools or programmes like CyberSafeIreland are used.  I would prefer the matter formalised within the education system.  Every time we move it out to other organisations it becomes disparate, whether the schools can afford same and whether the school considers it to be a priority.  It is left to either the principal or the board of governors to make it a priority.  We need to make cybersafety a national priority and consistently available to children.  My feeling is the more formal this is the better.<\/p> <p>  We have seen good examples of third level educators making training available on consent, for example, and notions of consent for third level students.  It means first year girls and boys or young men and women attend consent classes, which is excellent, but it is 12 years too late.  If we do not start talking to boys and girls about consent in an age appropriate way, one does not train and teach young people in the same way one does 18 or 19 year olds.  We need to talk about these issues earlier in schools.  We must help and enable parents to talk about these issues.  We undertook a piece of internal research last year on the perceptions of Childline among children, young people and their parents.  I was amazed to find that parents will say they are delighted when their children call Childline because sometimes they feel embarrassed to talk to their children about sex.  If that view pervades culturally within Ireland then we have a long way to go.  We need a formalised system of education that is not at the discretion of boards of governors, principals or patrons.  We need a formal system of sex education and education on how to use technology safety.  Only then can we say we have equipped our children and young children.  <\/p> <p>  I accept that cybersafety is extremely difficult for parents.  Parents have often said to us through our support line that they feel ill equipped because they do not feel they are tech savvy.  Our experience is that cybersafety is down to parenting and the standard of communication one has with one's child.  We see our children and young can fluently use tablets and technology.  People confuse that ability to be tech savvy with the ability to make the right decision online.  The decisions that young people make online have nothing to do with their technological ability or that of their parents.  Let us take two 14-year olds who are online and they are faced with a decision about whether to send a photo of themselves to somebody who they think they know.  More than likely one girl will say \"Yes\" while the other girl will say \"No\".  The more we understand their environment, psychological make-up and how they have been parented the better.<\/p><p>It is down to issues like that and which nothing to do with technology that affects how the young person makes that decision.<\/p><p> Education for parents needs to start and end with the level of communication and resilience they have built in their children over time.  We have ideas about how to do that, including support for teachers.  I imagine that too often people come before the committee and say our teachers need to be trained to do that.  We do not say that on top of everything else teachers have to be responsible for the safety of children and young people online but this needs to be formalised within the curriculum and resourced properly.<\/p><p> I was asked about the law and the office of the digital safety commissioner, ODSC.  We spent a great deal of time examining the LRC report and I urge members to read it.  It is an exceptional piece work, which gives a substantial overview of digital safety law, where the gaps are and how they can be filled.  We strongly agree with the creation of new offences that reflect our online world.  Harassment online is a different from offline harassment.  It works differently and it is more pervasive.  As Ms O'Sullivan said earlier, it is extremely difficult to get away from.  In this job, I am rarely shocked but I have been shocked over the past year by the emergence of stalking by young people of other young people.  We need to be grown up and recognise that and not assume that only adults stalk others.  There are ways to recognise this behaviour and it should be made an offence.<\/p><p> However, the LRC has said that in creating new offences, children should not be criminalised in that way.  The offences should be created to detect and prosecute adults but we should behave responsibly in taking prosecutions against a child.  That would only be done in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the DPP.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, we are learning all the time that children and young people feel ill-equipped to make the right decisions online.  They often do not understand the consequences of their decisions and it is worrying that we detect a sense of remoteness in children when they have been online for a long period as they lose a sense of empathy.  Sometimes when we work with them, it is clear they do not understand the impact of their actions.  It is very sad and worrying and Ms O'Sullivan will refer to this again.<\/p><p> The real change can happen is the ODSC.  I am not necessarily a fan of the creation of new offices for the sake of it but this will be different because the office should have a co-ordination role.  The LRC suggested the office should have three functions.  First, it should co-ordinate all the education work that is in place.  There has been a proliferation of organisations doing work in this area, including ours.  That is great but a co-ordinating organisation is needed.  We also need to make sure there are standards for educating parents and young people in this area.  Many good organisations are doing this work but we are less convinced some of them should be going into classrooms educating young people.  Second, the office should set standards for industry.  We need to be clear that industry needs to play a role.  Companies need to step up to the plate to make technology available to children and young people.  The office should put a set of guiding principles in place that industry would have to follow.  It could then take action.  Individuals could contact the commissioner if they wanted information deleted online.  The right to have information removed would be placed with the office.  If the industry body, ISP, telecommunications provider and so on did not follow the request, action could be taken.  It would be a useful office.  Third, the office should have an important role in investigating individual cases,  That would formalise much of the law in this area and regulate a regulatory policy.<\/p><p> I was asked whether Tusla is the right organisation for that.  Several organisations need to be involved.  Tusla has an important education function and, therefore, it needs to play a role in this regard but the right organisation needs to be the ODSC because technical experts are needed as well as people who understand the regulation of industries well and who can investigate online safety cases.  My preference is that this office does this but we have always felt that Tusla also needs to have a role because it has an education function.  That body needs to contribute.  Many of the referrals we receive in these cases come to us through Tusla and, therefore, it must be part of the debate.<\/p><p> On the apps question, we spend a great deal of time looking at Facebook, Google and Twitter.  Those companies get the scale of the risk to children and young children and they are putting serious resources into this area.  Alongside them, there is a long trail of much smaller companies that set out to make money and commercially exploit children and young people.  Not all apps do that but app providers and developers need to be regulated.  We need to focus on that as much as we focus on the large companies.  A great deal of emphasis is placed on these large companies.  We were particularly worried by an app called Yellow late last year, which in our view was a dating app targeted at children and young people.  It was difficult to find out how well regulated it was and what were the terms and conditions before it went live.  Our understanding was it was focused on teenagers and even though the company may well have a different view, the look, feel and language used to market the app were aimed at children and young people.  As a result, when we set up an account to examine this, it was obvious to us the terms and conditions were not available in an accessible way to children and young people.  If they tried to join the app, it was easy to do so.  It should not have been that readily available to children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Is it still available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#F00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Sullivan asked whether it is possible to change the content of another user on something like WhatsApp if one child-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#F00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>It is possible.

I agree with her.  One of the interesting aspects of the report is that it effectively states that the law alone cannot fix this issue and that education will be key.  The Law Reform Commission does not often make such an admission, which makes this a remarkable piece of work in terms of adopting education measures.  We need to listen to its views on this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that many of the legislative recommendations will be implemented, which is great, but her Department is not responsible for implementing the educational aspects of the report.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked on the proposal to establish an office of digital safety commissioner.  The Law Reform Commission examined the role of the office of Internet safety and one of the issues it identified was with the office's location in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The ISPCC has a role in this area through the advisory committee and we understand it is planned to move the office of Internet safety to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

I say this only half-jokingly because change has become even more rapid since my younger brothers were teenagers.

There is a bigger and wider debate involved in this issue to the extent that if something is happening in the adult world, it will definitely happen in the world of children.  I fully agree that education will be key but it must be provided across the board, for adults and children.  If this is happening in the adult world, we must target it because it influences children.<\/p> <p>  Have studies been done on learned behaviour, namely, the way in which adult behaviour affects children?  Cyberbullying is widespread among adults.  For example, people can say anything they like on Twitter.  How many tweets have been sent about certain people?

They can then choose to get involved in Facebook Free Friday or whatever.  That is something we can generate excitement about and get a buy-in, so to speak, regarding that.<\/p><p> I am interested in the role of the Garda.  It is difficult for garda&iacute; as well but at present the Garda is the only organisation that seems to be capable of addressing this.  We know that as a result of environmental factors or whatever they face in the home environment or outside the home, a certain cohort of children access pornography at an earlier age.  We know how difficult it is for an organisation like the ISPCC when it makes a choice to report it.  What are its guidelines on that?  It is a difficult problem that will become more prevalent the more we allow children access to freeflow of information.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses and I am pleased to hear the problem is not too complex to fix.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of information in the public domain, and some we do not even know about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#G01100","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>On the issue of the digital commissioner, I published legislation three weeks to establish the office of the digital commissioner and to address the issue of revenge pornography and the altering of images.

I studied the Finnish model and I am sure the Chairman, as a former member of the education committee, would undertake an examination of various international models.  Are there any international models the witnesses could envisage being implemented here?  Online bullying starts at a very young age in primary school and the difference between the Scandinavian model and what we have implemented in recent years is that the model was put on a statutory footing in Scandinavia.  Many of the initiatives we have implemented in this State have been on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  It is up to individual schools to implement their own policies.  I published legislation about two years ago to try to make that a statutory provision but, unfortunately, it was voted down.

God be with the days when we were all afraid of the bogeyman around the corner who we believed would do whatever to us but the biggest threat to children now is carried in our pockets.<\/p> <p>  In terms of this committee, an over-arching body of work is needed to get a whole-of-Government strategy and legislation to catch up with this area.  The difficulty is that the Internet is ever-changing and therefore the threats are ever-changing, with new ones emerging all the time.  It is difficult to keep up legislatively in terms of getting the curriculum changed and having all the bodies dealing with this area talking to each other.  I do not believe this Government will last the length of time needed to try to achieve the establishment of a commissioner's office and so on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of this committee trying to focus on one aspect and having listened to all the contributors, and in terms of our own bias, many of us are parents and we have a particular concern.  We understand the issues very well but there is fear in dealing with this issue.  The words \"Instagram\", \"Snapchat\" and others terrify parents.  We hear terms such as \"All you have to do is fix the router\" or references to the modem but all those terms create a blank wall for people of a certain generation, including my own.  In light of this what would be the view of the witnesses on a committee such as this one compiling a user guide for parents that would offer simple suggestions, such as children not having their phones with them in school.  Parents feel that if every other child in the school has their phone with them they should allow their child to have it.  Another suggestion would be to tell parents to take the phone out of the child's bedroom at night.  If we suggest that a child or teenager should not be on their phone after 9 p.m., I believe parents would react positively to that because they probably feel they are the only ones not allowing that.  I discovered by chance about six months ago that I could fix the modem at home and turn off the Internet for a number of hours every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#H00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Or a week.

It is the people who have always tried to access children for exploitative or abusive reasons who are using technology as a tool.  That is the way they are doing it today.  When I spoke earlier I told the members to think differently and separate the illegal behaviour from the harmful behaviour.  Unfortunately, there are predators who will try to access children for exploitative or criminal means and they will use technology to do that.  It is our job to make it very difficult for them to do it.  That is where the law and a strong regulatory approach comes in.  It will be a complex task and it will take time, but we must do it because ten years from now we will wonder how we did not see that children would be more exposed.  The behaviour of predators is changing.  They are using technology as a faster way to access children.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, the Garda has given some frightening examples of conversations between children and young people who, within three to four minutes of the person saying \"hello\" to a child, sex was being mentioned; in some cases it was far sooner than that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what can be done, the Garda has a very important role.  We have had some very good conversations with garda&iacute; about the potential of running a national campaign.  It is their view, and ours, that the garda&iacute; are recognised by children and young people as the law enforcement organisation and something we, or Childline, could do is go into schools to talk to children and young people so that they understand the dangers.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, many young people are too scared or ashamed to talk about this issue.<\/p> <p>  There are practical things parents can do, and we said this in January.<\/p><p>Parents buy phones and tablets before Christmas.  We tell them that Christmas is a busy time and that, when life has slowed down in January, they should return to their providers and ask them to help set controls on devices.  We should get that message out in as simple a way as possible.  One set of controls is handled through an Internet service provider, whereby access to the web at home is controlled, and another set of controls is on the handset itself.  We tell parents that they should take a breath in the new year, set those controls and educate themselves.  If they do not understand how to do that, they should ask their providers to do so.  Many of the providers with whom we have spoken have told us that they are more than happy to help set up controls for customers who bought devices from them.<\/p><p> As was alluded to, children and young people themselves have told us that they want to be safe.  Why would any child not want to be safe?  Parents should sit down with the young person.  Older siblings are helpful in this regard.  For example, 16, 17 or 18 year olds can set controls for children.<\/p><p> It is right to say that practical and immediate actions are necessary, but I would love to see a national campaign.  We need to start opening parents' consciousness without scaring them, because if people get scared, they stop making the right decisions.  We should tell them that they have more choices and ability than they realise.  They can ask their providers for help and speak to their older children or older children in the neighbourhood, young people and students who are attending university.  That might help to open up the situation.<\/p><p> We were asked what the office of a digital safety commissioner would do and what the legislative gaps would be.  As the LRC stated, that office should have a strong relationship with the Children's Ombudsman, who would have a role to play in this matter.  The digital safety commissioner's office would have an educational role.  It could run national campaigns regularly in the same way as the Road Safety Authority, which does a fantastic job at running safety campaigns at various points in the year.  It is running one this week because it is the mid-term break and children are off school, so people should drive carefully in highly developed residential areas.  The \"Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner\" is a very technical term, so it could be called something else and be made an open and educational office.  I like the idea of having children and young people involved.  They would have to be because that is the only way it can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Before Ms Long moves on from that point, I also asked how it would differ from the Office for Internet Safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#J00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The LRC goes into the matter in more detail.

This is the point that we have all reached, and everyone working and making money in this space needs to be meeting national standards.  If something has been said online about a parent or young person and he or she would like that removed, he or she should be able to approach telecom companies or Internet providers under the auspices of those standards and demand that it be taken down.  If the provider does not take it down or decides not to, the office would step in and investigate.  This is an important point and has been the process in other jurisdictions.  It would give the commissioner considerable power.  The Office for Internet Safety does not have the ability to investigate and regulate, given that it is an advisory body.  A digital safety commissioner's office would formalise the regulatory ability.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection, mentioned in his last report the right to be forgotten.  This issue has arisen.  We agree with his view that people should have the right to be forgotten in terms of actions that they take as children.  When people apply for their first job or a particular course years later, someone might Google them and find out about something that they did six or eight years ago.  Dr. Shannon has recommended that the law be changed to enable the right to be forgotten.  It is a good idea.<\/p> <p>  Regarding parents, I have mentioned the need for a national campaign.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying that we need to have a national conversation about pornography.  We welcomed that statement, but the conversation cannot be discretionary.  Too many schools can choose what they teach children when it comes to sex education and safety.  We are failing children by not having a national vision of what should be explained to children at the right age.  Many experts could do this well.  We are starting to see the impact of not having done this ten years ago, in that children are making the wrong decisions online or are unaware of what decisions they are taking.<\/p> <p>  I will revert to the question of the two 14 year old girls, one of whom made the right decision and the other who made the wrong decision.  Who are we failing and why is one person not making the right decision?<\/p> <p>  I apologise, as I cannot remember who asked about research, but it is an emerging area.  Interestingly, Irish universities are leading the way in the field of cyberpsychology, that is, understanding online behaviour and how it affects our psychology.  Dublin City University has a good department, so it may be worth inviting those involved to tell the committee about cyberpsychology.  The Institute of Art, Design and Technology in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a department of cyberpsychology.  There is a growing field of experts and academics.  I am sure that there are others, but those are the two that come to mind.  There have been good studies.<\/p> <p>  Someone asked about push-back from industry.  On Monday, I was in London chatting with the NSPCC about this matter and Brexit.  Ironically, the two issues are starting to come together.  Predators do not recognise borders and will use technology to work around them to get to children.  It is important that Ireland not lag behind other countries.  While the industry will have its own views and elements of it will be sceptical or progressive, it will need to come to the party because this is happening.  The UK has made good strides in terms of changing the law.  The Digital Economy Bill, which is going through the House of Commons, will begin regulating the industry in new ways.  The communications committee of the House of Lords is about to complete an inquiry into children and the Internet.  This is happening in other jurisdictions.  The same bodies will work in London and Dublin.  Unfortunately, so will people who want to access children.<\/p> <p>  Ireland can show leadership.  Many tech and telecom companies base themselves in Dublin and other cities.  I am happy to chat with committee members at any point about our concerns over the UK's exit, but we are really concerned that Brexit will undermine some of our ability to detect and prosecute child sex abuse and exploitation.  That discussion may be for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainia Long"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Fascinating.

For those boys who might be listening, I do not mean to make a generalisation, but when they contact us because something is happening, they can sometimes be quite aggressive.  The international way of dealing with that is by telling them that a service will not talk to them if they speak like that, but we tell them to take their time because we know that they are angry and ask them to tell us why they are angry.  We accept a level of that behaviour in order to engage boys, but it has been successful and we have maintained the 75% figure.  The online services see more girls.  We believe that this is because girls are a bit more advanced in terms of using helping services.  Boys are now at the phone level and will most likely move on to the online level, which is what we are seeing generally.<\/p><p>On complaints by children about other children in regard to cyberbulling, sextortion and those areas, it is their peers they are talking about, their school friends or friends of friends.  However, in other areas, such as grooming, it is strangers and individuals they do not know but have been friends with, have been following or have been followed by for a long period of time.  When we work with children, one of the things we ask them is to tell us about their friends.  They will say they have 500 friends on Facebook or 300 likes on Snapchat.  The numbers are enormous.  However, if we ask children who they would actually talk to if they had a real worry, they find it very difficult to name one person.  That is very significant in the context of where children can go in terms of help seeking behaviour and that is why they come to Childline and those types of services.  The majority of complaints are about peers but there are occasions when it is the adult predator who is actually seeking out a child through social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank the three witnesses for their time.

I will preface my opening statement by saying that as of yesterday we have received formal notification from the tribunal of inquiry team that we will engage with, which has asked for a range of information.  We are now in formal engagement with the inquiry team.  While I and my colleagues will do everything we possibly can to be helpful to this committee, I am sure members will understand that I will need to exercise some caution in not going into matters that will be covered by the terms of the inquiry.<\/p> <p>  Many members will know that in January 2014 Tusla - Child and Family Agency, became a separate legal entity to the HSE.  It was established on the back of some 29 inquiries and over 550 recommendations on how child abuse and child protection services should be managed in Ireland.  These multiple inquiries generated much debate and engagement as to how best protect the children of the country.  They recommended that a new approach was required.  A dedicated State agency was created to try to embark on a major reform and transformation programme to improve the lives of children and families who engage with child protection services.<\/p> <p>  It was a difficult start and the agency was set up carrying an &euro;18 million deficit.  At the time, my predecessor, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, submitted a three-year business case to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, perhaps aptly named, From Survival to Sustainability.  In 2016, some additional investment was made to help the agency move towards a sustainable footing.  While we did not receive all of what we asked for in the business case, the additional investment was very welcome and we have put it to good use.<\/p> <p>  However, as anyone who has embarked on a transformation and change programme of this scale will know, it takes longer than three years to fully complete and embed into practice.  Nevertheless, we can report that the first three years of improvement has taken place.  For example, in January 2014 there were close to 9,000 unallocated cases, that is, children awaiting allocation to a social worker.  By the end of December last year, the figure had reduced to slightly under 5,500, a reduction of almost 40%.  Within that, the reduction for cases that were deemed to be of a higher priority was closer to 80%.  We are not at all complacent about that.  Far too many children are awaiting allocation to a social worker and we will continue to invest in front-line services until this figure reaches zero and every child who requires a social worker has one.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will know that working in the field of child abuse and neglect is extremely challenging and complex.  Unfortunately, children are abused or at risk of abuse or neglect every day in Ireland and elsewhere.  Our staff deal with very complex human relations, which often involves unpredictable and sometimes violent behaviour.  In the vast majority of cases where we have to intervene in private family life, we deal with that intervention appropriately, proportionately, professionally and sensitively in an effort to try to maintain people's confidentiality, respect and dignity.  The over 4,000 Tusla staff around the country who work in very difficult circumstances get the intervention right on most occasions.  <\/p> <p>  One particularly challenging area of work that has emerged for us over the past few years is what we call historical allegations.  These cases involve adults coming forward to disclose information on abuse when they were children, usually around sexual abuse.  It is especially challenging because the legal framework around this area is not specific enough.  We have been, and will continue to be, in discussion with the Department of Children and Youth affairs as part of what will be a fundamental review and overhaul of the Child Care Act 1991.  We will work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that overhaul produces legislation that is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, we are operating on the basis of inferred legislation as a result of case law.  There are currently two cases in the court process which are challenging Tusla's role in allegations of abuse.  We await developments in that case law.<\/p> <p>  In the current circumstances, we are required to try to ensure that an alleged victim is supported while at the same time ensuring fair and due process for the alleged perpetrator, in addition to assessing whether any children may be at current risk of harm.  This is an extremely difficult balance to strike.  Traditionally, child protection social workers have been focused, through their training, on the protection of children and have not been skilled in dealing with or trained to deal with forensic-type interviews of alleged perpetrators.  We are beginning to develop that skill set, but it is very specialised.  We have created some posts and teams to try to develop that expertise.<\/p> <p>  It is in this very challenging context that we are dealing with cases which are understandably the focus of much debate and concern on the part of the public and in these Houses.  At this juncture, I would like to clearly reiterate our apology to people affected by our mistakes and for the distress and upset they have endured.  I accept that public confidence in the system may well have been undermined because of that, but what has happened is not reflective of the high standards that staff hold themselves to or that I as chief executive hold them to, in particular in regard to the handling of sensitive information.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out that I have no knowledge or evidence that Tusla staff acted with any malice of intent.<\/p><p>I also make clear that if I did receive such evidence or information, I would intervene personally, immediately and publicly.  As we know, mistakes were made and we very much look forward to working with the tribunal of inquiry in addressing this matter in its totality.  As far as I am concerned, the inquiry cannot come soon enough in order that all the facts are known and responsibility and accountability can be properly and fairly attributed. <\/p><p> I note also that Tusla is subject to a very high level of regulation and oversight.  We are one of the most regulated services or agencies in the country.  This scrutiny is done internally by area reviews and audits, sub-committees of the board, the board proper and the quality assurance directorate.  Externally, this regulation is carried out by, for example, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the national review panel, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the body that regulates and registers qualified social workers, known as CORU, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Moreover, HIQA recently completed a two-year governance overview in which all 17 of Tusla's operational areas received a child protection inspection and which visited our headquarters to carry out a review of our corporate governance arrangements.  We have seen and are commenting on the first draft of this report, which notes some significant improvement in services and staff morale.<\/p><p> To give members an idea of the volume of business Tusla deals with, we received approximately 120,000 referrals in the first three years of our existence.  More than 51,000 of these referrals relate to abuse and neglect.  It is, therefore, extremely important that we remain focused on the much needed transformation and reform of child protection services.  We owe it to the children who are the subject of the referrals and their families to provide appropriate, proportionate and timely responses to any concerns raised.<\/p><p> As we know, almost every inquiry into serious cases of child abuse in this country and elsewhere, including cases where children have died, has highlighted the lack of information sharing across key agencies as a key contributing factor to things going wrong.  Appropriate and responsible information sharing is the cornerstone of all child protection systems everywhere in the world.  It ensures children receive the specific intervention and response required.  I reassure the families with whom we work, members of the public and politicians that Tusla always endeavour to use this information responsibly and with the best intentions in the interests of protecting children.<\/p><p> Child protection is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.  One State agency on its own cannot achieve the best outcomes for children.  We rely on families, communities, politicians, government and the media to support us in this task.  I urge anyone who has a concern about a child to report it as responsibly and accurately as possible.<\/p><p> While Tusla must learn from mistakes and make continuous improvement, through the dedication of staff, which I see as I travel around the country, and by working in partnership with key stakeholders and wider civic society, I believe we will be successful in completing our ambitious transformation programme to reform child protection services and improve outcomes for the most vulnerable children in our country.  The evidence available to me thus far is that children are safer today than they were before the Child and Family Agency was created.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride for his opening statement and acknowledge the speed with which he responded to the joint committee's invitation to appear.  I believe the invitation was issued late on a Friday evening and was accepted first thing on the following Monday morning.  I thank Mr. McBride for that without hesitation.  As everyone will understand, the reason we invited him to appear before us was that the confidence of members of the joint committee, as individuals and parents, in Tusla was shaken to its foundations by a high profile revelation in the media.  In the meantime, a tribunal of inquiry has been established to investigate the matter.  As Chairman, I am conscious that it is my responsibility to ensure the committee does not cross over into the work of the tribunal of inquiry as it investigates the high profile case reported in the media in recent weeks.  I advise members that this is my responsibility under Standing Orders and precedent.  For this reason, I will not allow specific questions to be asked on the case reported in the media because we cannot prejudice the work of the tribunal of inquiry as it seeks to get to the bottom of that matter.  Notwithstanding those remarks, the joint committee is concerned to find out about the practices in place in Tusla.  All members have a shared concern for the welfare of children.  We would appreciate, therefore, if Mr. McBride would be as helpful as possible and answer questions to the fullest extent possible.  I do not wish to stifle discussion, other than to ensure we do not stray into the high profile case of recent weeks.

The Chairman has presented the background to the joint committee's decision to invite him to appear before us.  I acknowledge the speed with which he responded and welcome his open and honest statement in which he identified various issues that have been in the public domain in recent days.<\/p> <p>  I will steer my questions in two directions, namely, the issues of confidence and retrospective or historical cases, both of which Mr. McBride covered.  I propose to ask some pointed questions on the issue of confidence.  Is Tusla satisfied with its internal information technology system?  Mr. McBride will be accustomed to being asked that question as I have been asking it for a long time.  Is Tusla satisfied with the framework in place for sharing information?  If, for example, a child leaves Galway and moves to Dublin, how is this dealt with by counsellors?  I have some doubts about whether such connectivity is in place.  Does Mr. McBride have confidence in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Is Tusla satisfied with multi-party involvement?  By this I mean if a sufficiently good sieving mechanism is in place for sharing information among responsible persons.  When an allegation is made does Tusla have a sufficient number of qualified staff to investigate it?  Mr. McBride's statement that there are 4,000 Tusla staff is news to me because the Minister was unable to answer when I asked her a question on staff numbers in the past two weeks.  Does Tusla have enough staff to do its job?  In 2015, it was allocated an additional &euro;6 million to recruit more staff.  Have staff been hired to deal with the large number of retrospective cases identified in the detailed report completed in 2015?<\/p> <p>  Does Tusla have proper checks and balances in place to deal with people coming forward with allegations?  I assume the figure of 150,000 allegations, of which 50,000 related to allegations of sexual abuse, has since declined.  Are proper checks and balances in place to check and verify allegations?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of historical or \"bottom drawer\" cases, as I like to call them, does Tusla have a sufficient number of staff working on these?  Mr. McBride indicated the number of such cases had fallen dramatically in the past 12 months.  When I asked a question on adult disclosure cases on 5 July 2016 I was informed that a large proportion of the 8,865 such cases that were live in 2015 were still in high priority listing in 2016.  How many of these cases are still identified as high priority cases?<\/p> <p>  Are cases involving historical disclosures prioritised immediately as either high, medium or low risk?  I ask this question because an abuser could potentially be at large until a case is fully investigated.<\/p><p>How does Tusla categorise the original allegation that comes forward?  Is it in a high, medium or low risk capacity?  My understanding is that when retrospective cases come forward they are deemed to be low risk whereas I thought they would be high risk until they are investigated fully.  Does Tusla have the manpower to deliver on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#M00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride for attending in such an expeditious manner before the committee and for his apology, which I believe is sincere but which I would have to say is cold comfort to the affected family in the case we are all aware of but on which we cannot go into the specifics.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. McBride referred to the level of regulation and oversight in Tusla, both internal and external, but in terms of what happened recently, and other people have spoken about confidence in the organisation, it speaks to another situation.  Everybody here, and the public at large, needs reassurance from Mr. McBride on the procedures that have been set up even in the interim.  Whatever about the tribunal, there are ongoing cases of a very serious nature in the interim.  I am sure that every person involved in a case being dealt with by Tusla would be concerned to know it is being dealt with in the appropriate manner.<\/p> <p>  To err is human.

Notwithstanding that, confidence in Tusla has been shaken by recent events and many people are very concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  I have some specific questions.  Section 7.2 of the Children First guidelines states that it is essential that the Health Service Executive, which I presume in this area is now Tusla, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na designate personnel at assessment, investigation and management level who will remain involved with the case until the assessment and investigation is completed.  In that regard, are forms relating to those processes completed upon receipt of every allegation and in every case?  On that basis, can we assume that it would be relatively easy to identify the designated persons in each individual case, ensuring accountability and oversight of files held?<\/p> <p>  In the event that it was alleged that a file had been created maliciously, would Tusla be capable of disproving that?  Is it Mr. McBride's understanding that an administrative error of any nature regarding such a file should be reported as a data breach to the Data Protection Commissioner?  Does Mr. McBride believe there is systemic data protection weaknesses in his organisation?  Is it correct that the Data Protection Commissioner is carrying out an investigation into Tusla due to its failure to report administrative errors?<\/p> <p>  I want to underline the comments made by Deputy Rabbitte and Senator Noone on historical cases.  I, too, query whether those cases might be treated as lower risk cases and whether that might be contrary to the Children First guidelines.  With regard to historical cases, are there processes in place to ensure a review and that the cases are returned to rather than simply left lying on a shelf?  Are they investigated at least in some manner, and what does such a process involve?  Does the form template for allegations of abuse require that allegations of abuse are deleted from the form before being saved again as a template?<\/p> <p>  How many times since the establishment of Tusla have clerical errors led to files being held which falsely alleged abuse, and in what circumstances could that happen?  In the event of allegations of abuse being found to be without basis, at what stage are files generally deleted by Tusla?  Similarly, how long are files relating to allegations held in the event that no evidence is found to support an allegation and a case is not progressed by the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP?

Are those files retained or left open?  What happens to them?  Are they stored somewhere?  Can Mr. McBride give us an update on that?<\/p> <p>  If I recall correctly, Mr. McBride mentioned 122,000 referrals, 51,000 of which related to abuse or neglect.  What would be the general trend with regard to the other 70,000?  Given the fact that there is a good deal of data and information involved in that amount of material, has Mr. McBride identified any trends regarding the figures with a view to pushing that back to us, as political representatives, to formulate something around prevention, in particular, and the mental health area that might integrate with it?

Deputy Rabbitte asked if we had confidence in our IT system.  I am afraid the answer to that question is \"Not yet\".  We have inherited 17 areas as part of the HSE.  A number of those areas had different systems.  Some had paper systems.  We are now attempting to roll out what we call our national child care information system, which will be our client information system.  It will be national and will produce management information.  We are making some progress in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017 and into 2018.<\/p><p>Suffice it to say, the investment in ICT infrastructure has been insufficient for many years.  Some investment is now available to us to take our national child care information system forward.  That project has been a big priority for us over the past couple of years.  Our board identified one of our top organisational risks as not having a national information system.  In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question, we are not satisfied with the national system at the moment but we are working very hard to roll it out.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about multi-agency information and a sifting mechanism.  In terms of allegations of abuse by adults, as I said in my opening statement, child protection social workers would have ordinarily, through their training and education, been focused on how we protect the child.  The determination of the veracity of an allegation against a perpetrator is a much more specialist skill.  We must now develop specialist posts and teams to undertake that skill.  Traditionally, child protection social workers are not trained in the skill.  We must upskill ourselves and training is beginning to be put in place in most areas.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked if Tusla had enough staff.  We are still trying to recruit staff.  In 2016 we filled 514 posts of which 320 were front-line social work grades.  There are another 119 posts, of which 83 were social workers who accepted posts.  They are due to land in the first quarter of this year.  Recruitment is a big challenge for us.  Only 250 social work students graduate from Irish institutions every year.  To recruit we had to go to Northern Ireland and I, personally, went to the University of Ulster.  We are trying to recruit in the UK in order to fulfil our recruitment targets.  We are very much in recruitment mode.  We have managed to recruit some additional staff and reduced the number of unallocated cases.  There is still much more to be done in that regard.<\/p><p> The Deputy specifically asked if we had enough people to work on historic cases.

All of our inspections that have been undertaken by HIQA have recognised that where we identified that a child or children were at immediate risk then immediate action was taken.  I must be honest with the Deputy about what happens if an allegation is made by an adult about something that happened to him or her 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  Sometimes the allegation will be unclear due to the passing of time.  It may not at all be clear what the circumstances are or whether the perpetrator is still around and can be located.  If we are asked or challenged to prioritise that kind of case over a child who may be at immediate risk of harm we will prioritise the latter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Noone mentioned regulatory oversight.  Tusla is one of the most heavily regulated agencies in the country.  In terms of corrective action, we have done a number of things.  We have actively tried to engage with the Data Commissioner.  Before the current episode emerged we had previously engaged an external body to conduct a high level assessment of data protection practices and procedures.  The body has made some findings and stated it was impressed by saying:<\/p><blockquote>Tusla management had demonstrated an impressive appreciation for the confidentiality and care with which personal records and sensitive personal data should be managed across a wide range of services.<\/blockquote> <p>The body has made some recommendations and findings that we will act upon. <br\/><br\/>We have engaged with the Data Commissioner since recent events unfolded.  We have issued instructions to all of our areas to be particularly vigilant around data handling issues.  In the past couple of days I have invited them to contact me directly if they are aware of any particular issues of a similar nature.

Initially, we would open what we call an intake record or a record of the referral that has been made to us.  Not all of our referrals turn into ongoing cases.  Therefore, they are not turned into a file like the one I have here in my hand.  We have to keep a record of all information that is passed to us.  Where appropriate, if it is possible that a criminal offence has been committed, we share that information with the Garda.  A template notification form is passed back and forth between ourselves and the Garda to acknowledge the information.<\/p> <p>  In terms of designated persons in each individual case, we now have dedicated intake functions.  I am sorry if the term intake functions sounds a bit technical but it does what it suggests.  It deals with the initial referrals as they come in.  Normally that means referrals that were not previously known to us.<\/p><p>We generate that record.  The team leader of the dedicated intake team would take responsibility for the overview of referrals to the intake process and the decision on which of them needed to be allocated.  The majority are screened, that is, someone examines them initially and tries to make an initial determination of the level of risk contained within that information, and then we make a decision to move towards an initial assessment - the next stage of assessment, which is of a higher level - that would normally require the referral to be allocated to a social worker.  As we have already acknowledged, some referrals that are not immediately allocated are kept on a non-allocated list.  In most areas, the leader of the intake team would review the cases on the waiting list on a regular basis.  I have visited to see what the team leaders do.  Leaders may make visits to family homes to ensure that everything is okay.  They may phone schools to see whether they have any information.  They will clock any new information that might push the child up the priority list.<\/p><p> Importantly, it is not the case that children who are awaiting allocation are being ignored.  Their needs and priorities are regularly reviewed.  That is not ideal.  If we have decided that an initial assessment is required, the case needs to be allocated to a social worker, but there is not nothing happening - sorry for the double negative - with these cases.  They are largely being monitored.  In this instance, the designated person about whom the Deputy asked is the leader of the intake team, who is overseen by a principal social worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>There is a designated person for every intake record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#P00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>The team leader takes an overview of every intake record that comes into the intake team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Every intake record has to be signed off by a social worker and a team leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017022200002#P00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>It is beneficial to reflect on where we came from.  For example, I worked in the service at different levels - social worker, team leader, principal social worker, child care manager and area manager.  Some areas had five points of referral and six people trying to pick up work going back ten or 15 years.  Mr. McBride has outlined the service delivery framework, under which it is clear that we have dedicated, specialist teams to receive, review and make professional decisions on matters that are referred to our agency.<\/p> <p>  There is an interesting number.  We are known within communities and counties and everything is referred to us.  Some 60% of our referrals are about families in crisis or in need of help.  Deputy Neville mentioned prevention and early intervention.  We deal with those cases and have developed good processes and service interventions across Ireland that are available to such families.  We are connected in the communities.  As an agency, we take a lead in the children and young people's services committees, CYPSCs, which include city and county child care committees.  We are engaged in collaborative work and have produced good material on prevention, partnership and family support, which assists 60% of those families that are referred to Tusla to get an intervention in a timely and proportionate way.<\/p> <p>  The methodology attached to the relationship between the child protection service and the family support service has been worked up well.  In one area, for example, there were 300 plus referrals from the child protection intake team to the prevention and family support team.  Of those referrals that went out to families that required a family support service, only 7% were returned to the child protection system.  That is a good indicator that the professionals were getting it right in their initial screenings and assessments.

This is really part of the challenge.  Perhaps the chief operations officer can comment on this.  We have no specific power to compel.  For example, we cannot compel a person against whom an allegation is being made or any third party to talk to us about these allegations.  Sometimes what we have is an allegation that relates to a period of time 20 or 30 years ago.  On occasion, we have no means of following up with the alleged perpetrator and, therefore, these situations are left in a quite inconclusive manner unless further information comes to light.  This is part of the challenge we have in trying to balance fair and due process for a person against whom an allegation is made on the one hand and looking at the level of risk that may be contained in an allegation.  It is part of that balance and it depends on the quality and nature of the information we receive.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the template form for allegations of abuse, does it require that allegations of abuse are deleted from the form before being saved as a template again?

Obviously, there is appropriate information sharing and the referrals that come to the agency will come from a variety of sources.  They are all channelled into Tusla.  I understand the constraints based on Tusla being newly established and that there is a shortage of staff.  At what point does Tusla share information with the Garda?

Is it at the stage of the making of the judgment?  How does Tusla update that information?

We all know there is a large number of cases that have not been assigned to social workers because of shortages, etc., and that targets were not met by the end of 2016.

It is important to make the point that it is a big step for such parents to contact social workers and there is a major stigma and taboo around the social worker and what that carries with it.  What has happened in recent times has shaken those parents' confidence in the organisation.  Tusla should not underestimate the task it has to restore their confidence.  There are people with allegations.  Obviously, they will not work with Tusla.  However, there are many parents who are trying to do right by their children and they know that involves putting them into care, as difficult as that is.

The Public Water Forum stated that equity must apply to both those who paid the charges and those who did not pay, though it states that it has not had the opportunity to look at the issue in detail yet.  It is an issue we need to address under equity and fairness and my view is that people who have paid should be repaid if there is no intention of pursuing those who have not paid.  Do the witnesses from the Public Water Forum have any comments on that?<\/p> <p>  The document of the Public Water Forum refers to an adequate allowance for personal use and suggests a differential charge would apply for all users above the mean.  It states that the forum finds it difficult to conceptualise ways in which this could be applied where all households are not metered.  This is the crux of the issue for us and the question of metering as against not metering comes into the equity and fairness topic too.  If there is to be a charge for excessive use, how is that calculated?  Yesterday, the Right2Water group said it was in favour of charging for excessive use.

There are many areas where we have expertise among the members but one area where we lack expertise is in the area of finance.  The reinvestment requirement of Irish Water is such that the technicalities of the financial instruments that will be used are outside of our scope of expertise.  Our main suggestion is that the joint Oireachtas committee might be a place that could examine the feasibility of the model and how it might be applied to Ireland, in the case of Welsh Water in particular.

In any system that would have an excessive use charge, one would be looking at other ways for the non-metered people to identify excessive usage within that cohort.  There is obviously quite rich data around consumption and consumption patterns from the metered use.  There is the overlay that it can go with district meter areas to look at areas that have high volumes of usage that might suggest there seems to be excessive use in that, but it is more generalised than at a household level.  It depends on whether one is looking at cost-effective metering in the longer term and increasing the pool of people who are metered for that purpose or new builds that are metered.  It depends on a number of approaches that one might take that might increase the information in that regard.  This is something that sometimes can be resolved through the regulatory process.

A tax credit would involve work for the Revenue Commissioners and a refund of bills would involve work for Irish Water in terms of raising cheques and contacting people.  Some funding would be required in either scenario.

Given Ervia' s involvement in Irish Water and in other institutions that are in the business of providing services to householders across the country could it, in tandem with Revenue, be used as a vehicle for the delivery of credits through utility accounts and-or, as a last resort, a cash refund from Irish Water?

I am interested in the excessive use of water.  Scottish Water told us that they do not encounter excessive use or, specifically, wilful excessive use.  I wonder how one can charge for unintentional or unconscious excessive use.  If there are still so many leaks in the system much of the excessive use could be down to those leaks until they are identified.  One would not be able to identify excessive use in apartment complexes, which means that one would end up penalising one part of the population.  Some statistics in the commission's report showed that water usage per head in Ireland is quite low by international standards, which is an important point.  Excessive use, meanwhile, is tiny at 6%.  Yet we are focusing on all these measures.  <\/p> <p>  I think the Public Water Forum is out of touch.  I am glad that Professor Collins's last point was about trying to reach into the community to see what issues individuals face.  The obvious ones are medical and the use of swimming pools, which are easy to identify.  One just has to knock on doors.  One of the points that arose for me concerning household charges, was that thousands of grandparents now provide full-time preschool care for their grandchildren.

The Public Water Forum believes that every citizen should have a free entitlement to a water allowance.  That includes teenagers as well as younger children.  We believe every citizen has that entitlement, but we also believe that comes with a civic responsibility, especially for a resource like water.  As Mr. Wright has pointed out, we do not see the excessive use charge as a revenue-generating one.  We see it as an incentive to conserve.  We also see it as an incentive for the individual citizen to take responsibility for what happens between the water meter and their house.  If there is not an incentive for the householder to walk their land and assess whether there is a leakage problem, the likelihood is that it will not happen.<\/p> <p>  The Public Water Forum considered this recommendation of the commission and found it was in support of it purely on the conservation argument.  It was also based on building citizen responsibility, recognising that there are citizen rights, but with those rights go duties.  Part of the duty is that this is a scarce and vulnerable resource and so there is a duty on the individual householder to protect it.  If there was a run on a privately-owned resource in a house, which the householder was not supervising - such as their credit card, for example - we would expect them to supervise, measure and manage it, and act accordingly.  The same expectation applies here.  That is how the Public Water Forum has considered the issue and arrived at a view on it.  <\/p> <p>  I recognise that there are big transactional charges and cost recovery charges in all of this.  Ultimately, the revenue and conservation questions almost become two separate discussions.  The decision on whether to finish the metering process strikes me as a big one.  There is a big recommendation confronting this committee in that regard.  If one had never started out on the metering project, one might say that the returns on this do not necessarily add up.  Having started on it, however, there is another question, which is: \"Do you render as void all of the investment we've made to date, if we don't complete it?\"  Those are the kinds of choices the committee is faced with, but they are not easy calls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>There are a couple of questions I wish to address without commenting on the policy issues which the committee is examining.  Deputy Lahart talked about the experience of Scotland versus Ireland.  One of the things that people have commented on is the rich information we have obtained from consumption data to understand what our level of usage is.  One of those factors is that a very small proportion of people are using a huge amount of water.  Whatever way one tackles that it is an issue in the long run for a system in terms of operational costs and capital investment.  That is because one would be seeking in some way to try to eliminate that, whatever mechanism is used.  It is important to understand that it is not a normal bell curve.  In combination with other measures, there are huge outliers to be addressed in terms of leakage.<\/p><p>Specifically, the question was about collection charges.  The collection of outstanding bills is something that was originally built into the operational costs in Irish Water's business plan so I do not have a disaggregated figure, and in the event of a return to a charging regime I am not sure whether there would be any additional costs arising, but that is something that might more appropriately be asked of Irish Water.  My understanding is that in the normal course the regulator would look at Irish Water's operational costs, which would include collection of charges.<\/p><p> In the group water sector, as members are aware, there are two types of group water schemes.  There are those who get their water from a public source and those who get it from a private source.  The subsidy system recognises that.  There are two levels of subsidy.  The base subsidy is currently &euro;70 per household for a connection using a public source and &euro;140 for a connection using a private source.  Additionally, a number of those on private sources have design, build, operate, DBO, contracts which are more expensive and they get a top-up of up to &euro;220 per household.  Those levels were in place before domestic water charges were introduced.  They were reduced when the water charges came in and they have been restored.<\/p><p> In dealing with the group water sector, we have been very conscious to set out principles around fair treatment, but recognising that there is an inherent difference in structure.  They have their own particular cost structures.  For example, that is why we were giving them extra money for DBOs.  We were also conscious of the need to have a very simple arrangement for them because one is talking about a multiplicity of group water schemes, organised very much on a co-operative basis so they would want to have low administrative costs.  Because they are co-operatives, they do not want to gather a lot of personal information about their members so they tend to deal with things at a household level.  Those kinds of issues would have been factored in to the way we approached them.  In terms of equity and fairness, sometimes it is around the outcomes not necessarily doing the same for all people.  That is why we set out principles to achieve the same outcomes for the group water sector.  The sector obviously gets capital grants as well and that reduces the costs.  That includes not only things to improve quality but also metering, which reduces costs, water conservation and source protection and a range of other things to assist the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>What is the total annual cost of those three measures, bearing in mind that they were restored under the supply and confidence agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#G00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>A full year cost at that level would be expected to be around &euro;24 million.

There seems to be an ideology at play within the committee that one can only appreciate something if one pays for it.  That is the crux of the problem.  Merrion Square is a lovely park.

That is the logical conclusion of what we are saying, namely, that one cannot appreciate it unless we are paying for it.<\/p> <p>  If there is a leak in a house the risk of it undermining the foundations should be enough of an incentive for people to fix it, if it is identified and they are notified there is a problem.  In terms of equity and fairness in the excessive use charge, it is accepted that there is practically no wilful misuse of water so therefore it is about identifying leaks.  The question is whether we want to identify revenue that we can get through excessive use charges or if we want to identify the leaks and have them repaired and reduce water consumption that way.  On that basis, could the Public Water Forum also consider the provisions under section 56 of the 2007 Act, which make it an offence to waste water?  The fact that one could be taken to court and fined for the wilful waste of water is probably enough of an incentive to stop the wasting of water.  That is where the focus should be in terms of water conservation.  We already have the provisions under the 2007 Act.  From the discussions today it appears we are considering creating a significant bureaucratic system to identify excessive use and then monitoring it and changing it.  The one useful thing meters which have already been installed is that each one has a wastewater alarm on it and if a leak is detected section 56 could kick in as the person wasting the water would be identified.<\/p> <p>  It does not make sense to consider how we can fairly charge 880,000 houses for excessive use and not charge 630,000 houses.  We must knock that on the head.  In terms of the repayment of people who have paid already, we have no choice in that regard.  We have to do that.  If one goes down the road of excessive use then one has to go through all of those people and see who among the ones who have paid was excessive in his or her use.  It does not make any sense.

The subsidies that were agreed back in 1997 with the group water sector, against the background of there being no domestic charges, were the level of subsidies they were satisfied with, and we agreed the principles.  From looking at previous meetings I think that perhaps the federation have undertaken to give some information beyond what the charges are.  They are quite varied.  There would be a huge issue around the regulation of that sector.  The figures I gave include that in 2015 some 700 individual schemes looked for subsidies.  Somewhere around 350 of those are schemes covered by drinking water, meaning that there are 50 or more people involved.  Some of these group schemes are very small and some are large, and they all face very different cost structures which they have been happy to deal with in an independent way to date.  We have had no requests from the sector to change that overall regulatory process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>There are members from the group water schemes who are members of the Public Water Forum as well and have an input from that perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#H00700","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Before I ask a few questions I would like to make some brief comments.

I thank the witnesses for their answers so far.  I have three questions.  First, I wish to follow up on the Senator's question about the cost of pursual versus the cost of refunds.  Clearly, that would not have been included in the original Irish Water business plan because nobody would have expected us to end up where we are.  Has the Department started establishing costs?  Are there discussions between the Department and Irish Water to establish those costs?  Clearly, if a committee such as ours was neutral on the substantive issues and was trying to decide on refunds versus pursuals, that kind of financial information would be pretty important to us in at least determining which was more cost-effective.<\/p> <p>  I have asked the second question before but I am still none the clearer.  Group water schemes receive an annual subsidy but that does not cover the full annual cost of accessing the water supply.  Therefore if the expert group's recommendations that ordinary household use for those people connected to the water supply who are currently customers of Irish Water do not pay an annual charge for accessing that supply, equity would mean that the State would cover the full annual cost of group water scheme users accessing that water supply.  That would be obvious.  I have asked via parliamentary questions if we know what that cost would be.  We know the annual subvention cost is around &euro;24 million, but does the Department have figures for the total cost of those group water schemes?  I know they can vary from scheme to scheme.  What is the distribution concerning the three different grant levels of &euro;90, &euro;140 and &euro;220?  It would be useful to have that information when we are in private session next week making some of these deliberations. <\/p> <p>  My last question is related to equity but it is not in the expert group's recommendations.  It concerns the issue of water poverty.  We heard from Welsh Water that they have significant levels of water poverty.  Officials figures show that 15% of households live in fuel poverty across the State, but in counties with a higher percentage of older people it goes up to about 19%, for example, in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  We are not at the top end of EU fuel poverty but we are above average.  <\/p> <p>  What is disturbing about our fuel poverty figures is that we have one of the highest levels of what they unfortunately call \"excess winter deaths\".  About 2,800 predominantly old people are affected and research shows that there is a clear link between both.  In all this conversation about charging, given how poorly the State has responded to the issue of fuel poverty and the fact that we know it costs lives, does the Public Water Forum have any confidence in the State's ability to deal with water poverty when the Government's own figures clearly tell us that they are not doing a good job in dealing with fuel poverty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#J01100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I will comment on fuel poverty because I deal with that issue.

We have some information on groups which receive capital grants.  We do not have an overall perspective on these costs for the sector.  We did some work on a survey with the federation when we were looking at reducing the charges.  It surveyed a number of its sector members.  Based on that pre-January 2014 survey, the average charge for people on the public source group water schemes was &euro;38.79.  I give this figure with caution because I do not know whether farm or other usage was included.  The private source was &euro;60.50 and the average cost of all schemes based on an average household size of 2.7 was &euro;52.88.  This was in the context of reducing the subsidy.  When we reduced the subsidy it brought the average to &euro;92.29, which was broadly where the average charge from Irish Water would be because these are water only charges.  This is why we were trying to get to an equitable position.<\/p> <p>  I recognise the Deputy has asked a number of parliamentary questions on this issue.  In any of the discussions the only figure we can give is with regard to the subsidy from this perspective.  The point I made earlier was we have had a relationship for a period of time with the group water sector with regard to funding it.  This has included times where there were charges and no charges.  This is the regime it has been happy and satisfied with.  When there were no domestic charges this was the subsidy regime.  Clearly, the subsidies must be kept under review in light of the costs being faced, but we have not had a demand for a significant revision in the subsidy.  In fact, most of the demand has been on the multiannual capital programme, and the inclusion of issues such as source protection, water conservation and such issues, the rationalisation of schemes to give them a better cost structure, the appointment of quality officers and a number of softer measures with regard to involving professionals.  These are the areas of funding they have tended to examine.

While there has not been a demand for group water schemes until now, part of this is because group water schemes have seen the introduction of water charges.  If water charges for the vast majority of public water service users are abolished and the expert group's recommendations are accepted in the round and it becomes Government policy it will mean the vast majority of households will not pay a metered domestic charge on an annual basis.

For instance, the fuel allowance people would not be the same as people who potentially would face water poverty.  Water poverty tends to be looked at as water charges being more than 3% to 5% of income.  The outcome of the work done by an interdepartmental group which included the Department and the Department of Social Protection was in the context of developing a free allowance, in the sense that if a universal free allowance was set at a percentage it would ensure people were not brought into this category.

I was involved in a debate in the Seanad.  I also apologise if some of my questions have already been answered.  I ask the Chairman to direct me on this and I will read the transcript later.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the expert commission's report to the committee for consideration, there must be equity between group water scheme members and rural dwellers versus public water users, and we must deal fairly with those who complied with the law and paid their water bills in the past so they are treated no less favourably than those who did not.  These are the two key points on which the committee must focus.  With this in mind, and following on from what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said on group schemes, I contended it has never been fair because they have always paid.  They have always contributed to the supply of water through individual group schemes or through private wells and sewage treatment plants.  We have been given a bigger task because we are being asked to ensure whatever we recommend is fair to those and to public users.  Following what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, this brings a heightened expectation from those on group schemes as they will expect equal subsidy and support as those on public water supplies.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on what it costs group water schemes, to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin has referred.  We will need this information if they are to be treated equitably with those on public water supplies.<\/p> <p>  Something that has been lost in our debate is the environmental aspect of the sustainability of water supplies.  The EPA referred to it briefly in its contribution when it appeared before the committee.  In its submission to us on 30 January, the EPA discussed equity and fairness.  It stated the quality of drinking water in public supplies is consistently better than has been found in private supplies.  This is a fact quoted by the EPA and taken from its annual drinking water report.  Automatically, there is now an expectation that we need to recommend a system that is equitable to private and group schemes because they have a legitimate expectation their quality should be the same as those on public schemes.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will know from parliamentary questions that grants to support and subsidise group water schemes are subject to availability in the Estimates.  They have often been far less than what was applied for.  If we are being realistic about being equitable and fair we need to hear from the Department that grants applied for will now be fully funded and that there cannot be shortages.<\/p><p>Am I right in that assertion?  If so, what type of capital provision are we talking about in our Estimates?  Otherwise, it is not realistic and I believe it is unfair to expect equity and to raise expectation as is the case currently.<\/p><p> To refer to what Deputy's Pringle said earlier about appreciation, I think we all appreciate public infrastructure.  However, the fundamental issue here is that somebody must pay for that infrastructure, whether it is a public park, a roadway, a light or water provision.  It is either the taxpayer or the user or a combination of both.  Somebody has to pay for it and I think we all appreciate that.<\/p><p> My second point relates to the issue of fairness and people who have either paid their existing water bills and complied with the law in the past versus those who have not.  I know that views have been expressed and I have missed some of the discussion.  However, if we are going to have equality and fairness, it is one or the other.  Either we pursue payment from those who have not paid or we reimburse those who have paid.  In the view of the Public Water Forum, how best should we achieve this fairness?  Should we do one or the other?  Obviously, we have to do one or other.  I would like to hear the view of the Public Water Forum on that.<\/p><p> It is generally accepted now, from listening to various contributors over previous meetings, that there should be a charge for excessive use.  Even Right2Water accepted that yesterday and is on the record as having done so.  How can this be fairly achieved unless we install meters?  How can we fairly implement a charge for excessive use unless we have meters?  Is it possible at all?  Unless there is a fundamental acceptance that meters are necessary to measure where excessive use comes in, I believe that it might not be possible.  I would like to hear the views of the Public Water Forum on that.  I hope I have not been too convoluted.  I have mentioned two areas: group schemes and the people who have paid their existing bills.  How do we treat both of those and manage the expectation that is out there in the public domain, given the task that this committee has?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#K01300","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>With regard to two of the Senator's questions, we have discussed them already.

I will say two things about the group schemes.  At a personal level, I am a member of a group scheme and I also chaired the national rural water monitoring committee for ten years.  I believe it is important to think about the group scheme sector as an entity that is different in itself.  It is owned by the members.  It is a co-op.  One might argue that as a co-op, it is placed in slightly existentially different position than those who take their supply from the public scheme.  As a member of a group scheme myself, if I was selling my house in the countryside in the morning, there would be additional charges for supplying water to the countryside.  There are distance issues and isolation issues.  Usually, the State covers those charges, such as with the postal system.  Just because I am further away from the GPO than those in Dublin does not mean I pay more for my stamps.  One could argue therefore that I should not pay more for my water just because I am in the countryside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Be careful now.

In my connections and in my involvement with the group scheme sector - I say this making very clear that I am not speaking for the sector - within the forum, we have had very little pressure of any sort come to bear to change the existing situation as it impacts on the group scheme.  However, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has pointed out, if water charges will be free for everybody and are not free for a sizeable minority - the last figure I saw was that there are 500,000 members of group schemes - it is going to be very difficult to explain on the grounds of fairness, even if there are additional charges and the group schemes are that bit different.  As a member of a group scheme, I have a sense that I own it.  I can impact on its decision-making and attend meetings, but I do not own it in the sense that I do not have private shares that I can sell.  I still think it is a model that I am a very strong advocate for in terms of environmental management, in terms of people literally taking ownership for what is happening in their immediate environment and in terms of people having a very strong vested interest in how their scheme is managed.

In terms of the issue of capital that Senator Coffey raised, all capital is always subject to the amount received which is prioritised.  The investment in the rural water programme initially came from an adverse ruling of the European Court of Justice on drinking water compliance.  We had a programme of over 700, schemes which Dr. Collins mentioned he was involved in bringing up to scratch through various methods.  In our capital programmes, that is where the priority was for a number of years.  The funding was put in place and those schemes have by and large all been done at this stage.<\/p> <p>  We then moved into a multi-annual rural water programme approach.  With the Chairman's forbearance, I will state what the components of that funding are.  The first measure is about public health compliance in the group water sector.  We see it as really critical for the group water sector to sustain the water quality improvements we have made and really to deal with the deficits there.  Particularly within that, we have developed a remedial action list similar to the approach of the EPA to Irish Water in identifying those schemes that are risks and providing funding for them.  This will also include group water schemes that are on the list of a pilot infringement on trihalamethanes in the water.  That is the first measure and that is where most of the money goes.<\/p> <p>  The second measure is about enhancing existing schemes and making them more efficient in their operation.  I mentioned this before.  It involves water conservation, network upgrades and source protection.  That is around protecting the investment of close to &euro;1 billion that we have already put in.  The next measure is rural development, which is about supporting social and economic development in rural towns and villages by providing new group schemes where private wells are not an option.  That is probably the area that has been constrained.  It may be one of the areas in which the Senator and his colleagues have been anxious to see schemes advancing, though they have not seen it as quality has been higher up the agenda.  The fourth measure is about the transition of schemes to the public water and waste water sector.  Either because the scheme members want it or because of public health issues, this is where the best option in the long term is for the scheme to move under the remit of Irish Water.  Usually, investment is required to do that.<\/p> <p>  The fifth measure is around innovation and research.  That is particularly looking at efficient and innovative measures to improve the rural water area.  In the past, that has included things like integrated wetlands and solutions that may be more suitable for the rural environment.<\/p><p>The final measure is individual wells and we give grants for on-site wells and septic tanks.  In our change to the multi-annual programme, one of our initiatives was to bring in an expert panel of three people who review the bids from local authorities to ensure that they are done in an evidenced-based way and that they meet those priorities.<\/p><p> While extra funding can go in, it is important that we have a clear mechanism for deciding it and these are the measures that have been agreed with the federation.  We have been sustaining the funding at around &euro;17 million for the moment but it would have peaked at perhaps &euro;130 million - &euro;100 million anyway - when we would have had large design, build, operate, DBO, projects.  Obviously, we would be anxious to ensure that the investment continues in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I have a brief supplementary question.

She outlined some of it in her answer, but my question is whether she foresees an enhanced grant scheme, for example, for private wells and sewerage schemes as a result of the recommendation from the expert commission and possibly as a result of what this committee may recommend.  Is the Department working towards this in its Estimates preparation?  Ms Graham has already outlined that &euro;17 million is what is normally provided for.  This will obviously create a much greater demand and expectation.  We need to hear if that type of preparation is being implemented in the Department.

I would like to run through a couple of direct issues and get some confirmation on them.  My understanding is that there is no real risk of water poverty being created if we move to a generous allowance-based system of payment for water.  This is because there would be an allowance, which would be paid for, that would cover everyone's water requirements.  Such a system would create a zero rate possibility of water poverty.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the witness gave an answer on this matter, but my understanding is that the 2014 system, because of the safeguards in it, effectively ensured that there was no real risk of water poverty.  Will the witness confirm that to be the case?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate what Senator Coffey said in terms of group water schemes, but I am particularly interested in one aspect.  Professor Collins alluded to being a member of one himself.  In this perhaps political one-upmanship when it comes to group water schemes, there is a real risk that we - God forgive me for using the expression - throw the baby out with the bath water and that we lose an inherent value of group water schemes, which is the way they work within a community and provide a service.  My understanding from the conversations I have had with some of their members is that they would be very adverse to the notion of what would amount to a State takeover and a loss of the ethos, control and way in which a group water scheme works within a community.  We should be cognisant of that when addressing the group water scheme issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to one key aspect on the conservation issue and I appreciate that the question was probably answered.  I do not know what type of utopian world some people live in, but in the real world, which most of us inhabit, all the conservation notices, educational programmes and carrots, as I think they were referred to earlier on, in the world will not alter behaviour to the same extent that a very good and effective stick will.  I would ask those who believe in the virtue of Merrion Square to think about it.  If there was a sign around the no parking zones in Merrion Square that asked us to please give up the spot in two hours and let someone else use it because parking spots are scarce, how many people do we think would voluntarily pull their car out after two hours and head off?  As one of those who remembers living in this city prior to clamping, I can assure the committee that those spots would be gone at 8 a.m. and that they would not be back.  I would very much share the view which was outlined that it would be insanity not to have some enforcement.<\/p> <p>  On the notion that we could end up using the 2007 Act to fine people as an efficient means of trying to persuade them to conserve water, we are all aware of the absolutely calamitous situation we have with issuing fines in this country and trying to get people to pay them.  Given the cost involved and the ability to appeal a fine for excessive water usage, possibly to the Supreme Court, to me this would be an insane system for this committee to consider.  I hope that we would be guided by some of the advice provided in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  At the heart of it, the witness seems to be siding very much with the commission's report in terms of its recommendation for the usage in this area.  Will the witness confirm that to be so?  I heard him say he would take it on board, so I reassure Dr. Collins that the biggest thing the grandparents of Ireland who are minding children have complained to me about over the past five or six years is the fact that someone destroyed the economy of our country, that they are delighted to have the children in the house and minding them and that their own children are out working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017022200002#M00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Deputy, hold on.

It is probably useful to remind the committee that the concept of the subsidy to the group scheme was introduced in the 1990s and coincided with the abolition of water charges at that time.  Its introduction was triggered by the fact that households that had paid water charges prior to then were no longer paying them.  It is therefore reasonable to expect that the group sector will have a view should the final determination of the matter be that their members will pay and others will not.  I suspect that will be a difficult argument to hold.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, the ethos of self-management around a key resource is an important ethos to protect.

In the late 1990s that scheme was broke.  It had been charging a flat rate to its members.  Group water schemes include domestic users and non-domestic users such as farmers.  When that scheme moved to meter-based charging, in one year usage was reduced from 18 million gallons to 11 million gallons.  This was not entirely due to conservation.

However, at the outset, I want to be very clear that my resolve and my determination to improve our health service has only been strengthened.  Members know that I believe this requires an all-party effort and that this committee and the Committee on the Future of Healthcare are vehicles for building the kind of political and societal consensus we need in the delivery and future direction of our health service.  I am happy, of course, to be held to political account for the challenges and problems we face but I would also like to acknowledge that my engagements with the Oireachtas have continued, in large part, to be constructive and co-operative in nature.<\/p> <p>  As I think members would expect me to, I am going to start with waiting lists.  I hope that everyone understands that I believe, as Minister for Health, I should express my genuine feelings on the impact on patients of waiting too long for treatment but it is wrong to characterise my honest response to their suffering as my only response.  I want to focus on what we can do and what we are doing to address waiting lists and waiting times for patients.  This has been a consistent focus of mine since becoming Minister.  During 2016 there were growing numbers of patients waiting excessively long times for inpatient or day case treatments and the trajectory being forecast by my Department and the HSE was stark.  Consequently, with limited additional resources, I unapologetically targeted resources at the specialties with particularly long waiting lists, such as scoliosis and orthopaedics through the winter initiative funding.<\/p> <p>  The HSE put in place an action plan to halve the number of patients waiting 18 months or more for their inpatient or day case procedures.  Through that action plan, over 11,500 patients came off the inpatient-day case waiting list from August to December 2016.  Also in 2016, the NTPF undertook an endoscopy waiting list initiative to arrange for the provision of endoscopy procedures to all patients waiting over 12 months.  By the end of December, over 5,500 people had come off that waiting list.  However, as members know, overall waiting list figures rose in January 2017.  I am disappointed by this increase but not surprised as our hospitals responded to the ongoing pressures of high emergency department attendances and admissions during this peak winter period.<\/p> <p>  I am also aware that it will take some time before waiting list figures will start to go down.  This year, waiting list initiatives have been planned and scheduled to take into account peak emergency department activity in hospitals and times when the private sector capacity is most available.  Scheduled care will be the main priority from spring through to winter 2017.  Some &euro;20 million has been allocated to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  The NTPF is starting with a dedicated &euro;5 million day-case waiting list initiative with the aim that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a day case procedure by 30 June 2017.  It is expected that in excess of 2,000 patients will receive treatment through this process and it is expected that patients will commence receiving appointments for treatment during March.<\/p> <p>  The main areas of focus will be those lists with large numbers of long waiting day case patients, namely, ENT, ophthalmology, general surgery, dental, urology and vascular surgery.<\/p><p>The HSE is also producing a waiting list action plan for 2017, which will outline waiting list initiatives to be driven by hospitals and hospital groups.  I expect to receive this plan by the end of the month.  This plan will concentrate on reducing the length of time patients wait for an inpatient, day case or outpatient appointment with the aim that by the end of October no patient will wait longer than 15 months.  While I consider this is still far too long, it would mark a significant and solid reduction in waiting times with the aim of building on it to reduce waiting times even further.  In order to ensure the best outcome for patients waiting, the HSE and the NTPF are working together to utilise all available capacity, public and private, and the plan will be supported by the NTPF&rsquo;s proposal for the remaining allocation in 2017.  I am also considering what further measures should be taken to ensure patients have access to more timely procedures and, in that context, I am of the view that a number of individualised targeted initiatives are required.  I have visited a number of hospitals in recent months and am particularly concerned about waiting lists in the specialties of gynaecology, particularly in Cork, and cardiology, as well as waiting times across a number of specialties in certain regions.  I have asked the HSE to address these specialties in particular in the action plan it has under development.<\/p><p> I want to make specific reference to scoliosis.  While some progress was made in 2016 as a result of the extra investment in the scoliosis service, it is clear there is much more to do to provide the level of service that is needed.  Additional funding has been provided - &euro;2 million was made available under the winter initiative in 2016, which saw over 50 additional children and teenagers treated and receive their procedures for scoliosis.  While this investment made some progress, there is much more to do to.  I recently met with the CEO of the children&rsquo;s hospital group and the CEO of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  I can confirm that the new theatre will provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures from April, following the recruitment of additional theatre nurses.  An orthopaedic surgeon post in Crumlin Hospital will be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  The HSE is now working on a specific action plan for scoliosis, which it will submit by the end of the month.  I will be happy to share it with the committee.  This is all with a view, as the director general has said, to making sure no child or adolescent waits longer than four months by the end of this year for a procedure.  It would bring this country in line with other jurisdictions, including with the NHS.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the situation regarding our emergency departments throughout the winter period.  I acknowledge the distress for patients and their families and the impact on staff caused by overcrowding.  I also acknowledge the intensive efforts by staff, management and the HSE on a daily basis to work to ensure that patients receive quality care in a challenging environment.  While the number of patients waiting on trolleys continues to be far too high, over the last couple of weeks emergency department congestion has been easing in many hospitals.  I commend all the teams across acute hospitals and social care that work together on a daily basis.  I acknowledge the achievements they made, particularly on delayed discharges, which reduced from a high of 659 earlier in 2016 to a low of 496 on 15 February 2017.  In addition, we have seen extra patients avail of aids and appliances, 900 additional home care packages and 90 newly opened beds in the Mercy hospital, Cork, University Hospital Galway, the Mater, Beaumont Hospital and Mullingar hospital.  I have repeatedly made clear that if we want to break the vicious cycle of overcrowding, we will have to do things differently.  That involves extra bed capacity, extra staff capacity and also doing more in primary care.  During the last year, over 100 additional hospital consultants, almost 250 extra non-consultant hospital doctors and nearly 500 additional nurses and midwives have been employed by the HSE.  In addition, my officials are working with the HSE to develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning with the objective of recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff.  I expect to receive a report and implementation plan during 2017.  Members will know that the bed capacity review is a commitment in the programme for Government and is now under way.  I am keen the review is progressed sufficiently to enable it to feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme, which will take place later this year.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, I am also anxious for it to have a short-term focus and determine how capital investment over the coming years can be targeted, given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital service.<\/p><p> Information technology can also play a significant role in underpinning a more integrated approach to managing waiting lists which would achieve a more patient centred approach.  One of the critical enablers of any integrated waiting list management system is the unique individual health identifier, IHI, which was given a legislative basis in 2014.  The system of identifiers will be deployed across the public and private health care system.  The electronic health record became a reality in December 2016 with the arrival of Ireland&rsquo;s first digital babies in Cork and the deployment of the IHI register in the health sector. <\/p><p> I will take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous commitment and dedication of all our health care professionals working throughout the health service.  I am very pleased we have reached agreement with the IMO, the HSE, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issue of the restoration of the living out allowance for non-consultant hospital doctors.  The agreement reached with the IMO and management provides for restoration of this from 1 July 2017 in the context of the forthcoming public sector pay negotiations.  It also provides fulfilment of the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations of the MacCraith report, which will see a review of the continuing education requirements of NCHDs undertaken under the auspices of the WRC between March 2017 and May 2017.  I am very pleased the IMO will now not proceed with the ballot for industrial action.  It is a very welcome development for our health service.  <\/p><p> I will take this opportunity to address the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives.  I, my Department and the HSE recognise the importance of recruiting and retaining nurses and midwives within the public health service.  It is also recognised that the fall in numbers employed between 2008 and 2013, from 39,000 to 34,000 had to be addressed when the moratorium ended.  There are many initiatives under way to improve staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme holders and full-time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE ran a three-day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period which will be the first of number of events this year.  In September 2016, the HSE set up a project group to review nursing workforce planning, recruitment and retention.  This group is due to report back to the national director of HR this month.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to 1,000 additional permanent nursing posts in 2017 as part of the programme for Government.  These posts are provided for in the HSE&rsquo;s service plan.  The HSE&rsquo;s management is committed to engaging constructively with the INMO to address its concerns and to address a range of initiatives.  I appeal to everybody to redouble their efforts.  We have just under two weeks before the INMO is due to commence working to their contract.  It is not in the interest of the health service.  The INMO, the HSE and Government would like to see a resolution to this.  We all need to work together on that.<\/p><p> I should circulate the rest of my statement to allow members to ask some questions, which I know are on people's minds.  I will deal with issues on the national children's hospital, prescription charges, patient safety and a number of other areas but in the interest of time I am happy to have my script circulated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#C00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the Minister's script-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Has it not been circulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>It arrived at 1.25 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>It is circulated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I now ask Mr. Tony O'Brien to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I will touch on a couple of areas.  In terms of the financial position, the draft 2016 financial outturn figures for the health service indicate net expenditure of &euro;13.528 billion against an available budget of &euro;13.514 billion giving rise to a small adverse variance of &euro;14 million.  The delivery of a &euro;14 million or 0.11% in-year variance represents practical financial break-even, given the scale of the health services overall resources, and means the HSE is not starting a new financial year in 2017 with a very significant incoming deficit.  It clearly shows the benefit of receiving sufficient funding early in the year, including the &euro;500 million received mid-year, to set achievable financial targets for health service managers, clinicians and staff.  It also demonstrates the health services ability to deliver when set achievable targets and, in that regard, I thank all of our management and staff for their hard work and efforts.  I also acknowledge the support received from the Department of Health, including its assistance with meeting excess costs associated with the State Claims Agency.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has already outlined issues to do with the winter initiative and, in the interest of time, I will take those as read.   <\/p> <p>  On the issue of acute hospital waiting lists, I will take this opportunity on behalf of the HSE to apologise once again to all patients who have had a poor experience either in terms of waiting times or communications with our services.  A key priority for the HSE is tackling long patient waiting times and ensuring timely access to treatment and care.  We fully acknowledge that patient waiting times are unacceptably long in certain specialties and this, to some extent, reflects the need for greater capacity and staffing in certain specialties within our services.  It is also essential that we fully optimise our public capacity.<\/p><p>Each year in our hospitals more than 3.3 million patients attend outpatient services, while one million have a planned day case procedure and approximately 100,000 people have an elective inpatient procedure.  Between January and November 2016, more than 1.5 million inpatient and day cases were completed in our acute hospitals representing an increase of almost 30,000 when compared to the same period in 2015.  It is fully acknowledged that waiting lists in certain specialties including ophthalmology; ear, nose and throat, ENT; orthopaedics, urology; and general surgery have seen significant increases in the number of patients waiting for treatment.  It must be noted that both the challenge of availability of consultants in these specialties as well as hospital capacity have contributed to this increase. <\/p><p> The key issue for patients is how long they are waiting and based on national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, figures published in January, 36% of patients are waiting less than three months for an inpatient day case procedure, IPDC, 58% are waiting less than six months and 2% are waiting over 18 months; 93% of adult patients were treated within the national target time of 15 months for IPDC; 69% of patients were treated within the eight-month national target; and the proportion of patients waiting over 18 months fell from 4.5% to 2% at the end of December.  A key focus of the HSE waiting list action plan 2016 was to reduce the number of patients waiting the longest length of times for inpatient and day case procedures.  The HSE's target, approved by the Minister, was that we would reduce the number of patients waiting over 18 months by 50% and that there would be no more than 1,800 patients waiting for more than 18 months.  We exceeded this target and the number of patients was reduced to 1,738 due to the treatment-removal of over 11,500 people from the waiting list.  <\/p><p> An important feature of the 2016 waiting list was optimising our public capacity as well as outsourcing activity.  For example, 200 cases were undertaken by Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital for other hospitals, the Mater Hospital undertook 24 spinal and scoliosis cases on behalf of Tallaght Hospital.  University Hospital Limerick carried out work for the Saolta group and Kilkcreene Orthopaedic Hospital carried out work for Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore.  We will build on this approach in 2017 with particular reference to orthopaedics, scoliosis, ophthalmology, vascular and ENT services.<\/p><p> In 2017, the HSE is working with the NTPF to develop an action plan for inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists to deliver on the 2017 target that no patient would be waiting longer than 15 months by the end of October.  It will set out specific actions by groups aiming to optimise existing public capacity within hospitals and groups and targeted outsourcing for those specialties where there are known capacity challenges.  The approach outlined will be underpinned by strong oversight and governance by hospitals and groups and at national level.  With specific reference to scoliosis, the HSE has set a target of four months for treatment of scoliosis and is finalising a comprehensive plan in this regard.  This will require a range of solutions given the capacity challenges in the Irish public and private system. <\/p><p> The eHealth Ireland programme within the HSE has had some success in 2016 creating the first digital hospital in Ireland delivering the infrastructure for an individual health identifier to be \"turned on\", completing the implementation of e-referral into every acute hospital and beginning the implementation of e-prescribing in the community.  In 2017, the eHealth Ireland programme will continue to move towards an electronic health record, EHR, for Ireland.  While the full EHR business case is being considered, the programme is working to put in place foundations that enable an innovative and yet considered progression to delivering a digital fabric for the way in which health care is delivered.  As well as these foundational programmes of work, the eHealth Ireland team will continue its work in new and innovative arenas.  Genomic sequencing for epilepsy patients will continue, the implementation of an artificial intelligence mobile \"friend\" for patients with bipolar disorder will be piloted and digital supply chain management to the door of patients with haemophilia will be delivered.  All of this will be achieved within the current HSE IT budget.  If we were to invest even 1% more in this area, the team is confident that it could deliver striking benefits to the system and 1% more would still be 1% less than the average EU country.  This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

We have more Ministers on this occasion.  I hope this delegation will be the same one that will be in front of us in a few months time.  I am sure all the Ministers would agree with that.  Given the times we live in, I wish them the best of luck.  The situation in accident and emergency departments has improved recently but one would expect it to improve given the time of year.  Is there a way in which we can change the pathways system regarding those who are being crammed into accident and emergency departments in Tier 1 hospitals and better use the under-utilised minor injury units across the country?  There are people who end up in accident and emergency departments in Tier 1 who should not end up there.  There are other options.  It is creating a dynamic in those hospitals that is debilitating from a capacity perspective.  I am most familiar with the midwest.  There are minor injury units in three locations yet the situation in Limerick, which I visited recently,  is terrible.  Is there not a way in which we could use these units better because the capacity there is not being used and it would help?<\/p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions about capital because I am a bit confused.  The Minister announced an investment in respect of a new accident and emergency department for Galway in the past week or so but I would have expected that this would have been announced as part of a capital plan that is meant to come out in a few months time.  However, it was pre-announced.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will take an interest in this.  Where are we in respect of the proposed new accident and emergency department for Beaumont Hospital?  Will this be part of the capital plan?  It is something that has been projected numerous times.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister visited Limerick.  All I will say is that there is an expectation regarding an accident and emergency department because I will not be unfair to the Minister and say that there was a promise or put words in his mouth.  The CEO of the HSE confirmed to me that this accident and emergency department is to be opened in the last quarter of this year.  There is an expectation among the clinicians, staff, management and the general public that it will be opened before the summer.  Will this happen?  I have a response from the chief executive of the University of Limerick Hospitals Group, Colette Cowan, who said it can be opened but will need &euro;2.7 million.  As we all know, the accident and emergency crisis in Limerick is probably the worst in the country.  I am sure the Chairman agrees with this.  Can this figure of &euro;2.7 million be found?  The recruitment process is ongoing.  It would be very much appreciated if it could be because it would alleviate certain significant issues that exist there.  One end of the county I represent uses Limerick while the other end uses South Tipperary General Hospital.  Ratio-wise, they are probably the worst two in the country in terms of overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  <\/p> <p>  This brings me to South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel.  I know there has been a lot of political talk about potential avenues regarding accommodation.  What stage is this at?  A national tender that has been put out.  I expect that this will be part of the future capital plan as well.  It must be prioritised.  The situation is incredible.  Will we ensure that it can be part of the capital plan upfront and built in the coming years or are we going to go through some temporary offering for a long time from which we may not get the results?<\/p><p>I would like some clarity on that.<\/p><p> In fairness, Mr. O'Brien and the Minister acknowledged the staff and management.  I have my own issues, as have a number of members, with the Health Service Executive, HSE, management but there are some brilliant people working in the HSE.  Some of them took grave offence to some of the comments made recently by the Department, Ministers and the HSE.  Generalisations do not tend to work, so I am glad that was clarified.<\/p><p> With regard to the waiting lists, the Minister and Mr. O'Brien went into considerable detail on that, and my colleagues will have many questions so I will not take up all the time, but how can we be certain that the figures outlined here are correct following the experience we have had in recent months?<\/p><p> Regarding the national maternity strategy, of which I am a huge supporter, are we on track as regards funding that?  We must bear in mind that there is a capital requirement with regard to planning the new maternity hospital.  There are four hospitals - three in Dublin and one in Limerick - and there is a capital requirement &euro;1.5 million in 2017 which is not being provided for.  That suggests to me that in year 2, we are already behind.  This is an excellent strategy, which this committee examined in detail, but if that funding cannot be found for the design of the new maternity hospital, what will be the position?<\/p><p> With regard to the children's hospital, which will come up in detail from my colleagues' questions, when will the Minister have the report that will tell him how in the name of God we ended up with the costs that have been outlined?  The original cost was &euro;450 million.  It increased to &euro;650 million and now, by all accounts, it is &euro;1.2 billion.  He might not have all the answers now but he has told me previously in correspondence that he will have them.  When will the Minister have that report, which is referenced in the document he provided?  I am sure all of us would like to find out about it.<\/p><p> I have some final questions.  A review is ongoing of ambulance services across the country.  It started in the mid-west.  What is the purpose of that review?  The Minister wrote to me stating that there will be no cuts in the mid-west, and I thank him for that, but what is the overall purpose of the review?<\/p><p> As it was one of the first issues I raised with the Minister on his appointment and my being appointed to this role, I am delighted about what has been done with regard to scoliosis in the recent past.  There was a national outcry following the \"Prime Time\" programme, and rightly so.  Many of us had been dealing with this issue for some time.  I am delighted with the changes that are happening and the funding that has been found.  My only issue is the reason it was not happening anyway.  There is a concern that if the pressure builds up, consultants and clinicians can be found, theatres can be opened and money can be found.  If that is the case, people will ask why it can be found for that area and not for somewhere else.  I agree with what is happening.<\/p><p> That brings me on to the issue of Orkambi.  What is the position on that?  What is the position on Respreeza for alpha-1 patients?  There are 21 people on that drug on a trial basis and they are worried that at the end of this month or early next month they will be taken off it.  What is the position on both Orkambi and Respreeza because there are 40 more patients waiting to go on the latter?  I understand 13 other countries are using this drug so why are we not signing off on it?<\/p><p> An issue in which I take a personal interest is e-health.  I support the changes that are happening.  A number of us sit on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  I believe the issue with regard to IT systems across the health care service is chronic.  I presume the various projects that have been outlined are being piloted in different hospitals and across various disciplines but a public service card is being produced separately to that by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is something of which I am a huge supporter.  If this public service card is to be used effectively for everything in terms of one's interaction with Government services, and eventually will go to consumer services into the future, will somebody please tell me that under the e-health initiative the patient number will correlate with the PPS number and that they will be interoperable?  If they are not, it will be one of the most stupid initiatives of all time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#E00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, the Ministers of State and the delegation from the HSE.  I have a few questions so I ask the Chairman for his indulgence.  First, we discussed this issue previously and Mr. Woods will remember the discussion about the 107 nurses required in accident and emergency departments.  I refer to an agreement reached between the HSE and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and SIPTU last August on a jointly agreed review.  At the time, Mr. Woods was fairly clear in telling us, to the shock of the unions, that the specialist ring-fenced funding for the 107 nurses needed to cope with the people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, which all the witnesses say they do not want but which keeps happening so there is a need to treat them, was not in the HSE budgets.  When I asked the HSE about that they said that the Department of Health had not provided for those.  I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth, and Mr. Woods can refresh my memory if I am wrong, but could we find out what is happening with regard to those 107 nurses?  I know the INMO wants to see those nurses recruited, as does any poor soul on a trolley in an accident and emergency department.<\/p> <p>  Second, I refer to something not in the statements provided, namely, the stretch targets, which we have discussed.  I cannot see any scenario whereby that does not put pressure on hospital managers to bring in patients from the private sector because they are a target.  That is Mr. Woods's word, not mine.  If something is a target, it has to be achieved.  Mr. Woods has set targets.  He has also set what he described as stretch targets, which I assume is whatever the target was last year in addition to additional ones, for private patients being treated in our public hospitals, presumably at the expense of our public patients although Mr. Woods can correct me if I am wrong on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to e-health and IT, one of the answers given to a question I submitted states that there is a need to recruit additional resources and that this requires departmental approval and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, sanction.  What amount of additional resources does it require?  When was the approval from DPER sought?  What was the answer?  If it has not been sought, why not?  This is supposed to be a priority.  We could sit here all day and tell each other about the wonderful benefits of improving IT systems, and none of us would disagree.  That might be a very pleasant conversation but given that we all know we have to go down that road, when will the decision be taken, if it has not been taken already, to seek the sanction from DPER?<\/p> <p>  In response to the same question Mr. Woods said that the waiting list action plans will not specifically incorporate technology supports but that the Minister is open to evaluating new approaches and that he will ask the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to lead a project team to undertake such a feasibility study and report to him within six months.  That is great, but I put it to the Minister that there is no time like the present so we might move on that.  It is one of those fantastic subjects on which we all agree there is a need to move on it.  I wonder why we have not done so.<\/p> <p>  I will not bore the witnesses with my views on the NTPF because they know them but it appears from reading the answers to the questions I submitted that the NTPF will be reviewing itself in terms of its performance, targets and so on.<\/p><p>When I asked questions about the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, previously I was told that a robust monitoring framework would be put in place.  My view of such a framework is one that would have external oversight.  However, from my reading of the answers that have been given to questions, and I am open to correction on this, it appears the NTPF will be reviewing itself.  One does not need to be a genius to figure that one out.  If we are all reviewing ourselves we will all do terribly well.  Will Mr. O'Brien outline what checks and balances in terms of targets, monitoring and evaluation of the NTPF are in place, given a considerable amount of public money has been invested in it?<br\/><br\/>With regard to commitment that children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will be awarded a medical card, according to the answers I have received, the extent of this initiative is to be reviewed.  The programme for Government indicates that 10,000 children will benefit from this initiative.  We submitted a parliamentary question on this initiative and costed it prior to the last budget.  We came up with a figure of &euro;17 million to cover the cost of it.  The HSE obviously did some work on it, because it put a figure of &euro;10 million for this in its budget.  What is the latest delay on the implementation of this initiative?  There is not a day goes by that at least one family does not contact me directly or my office in Swords to ask when this will be introduced.  It must be one of the most announced Government measures ever.  It is last July since I tabled a cross-party motion on this measure, which was accepted by everybody.  No barriers are being put up to this by any Deputies or Senators.  We all want to see it introduced.  Yet when Mr. O'Brien<b><i><\/i><\/b>responded to a question I asked, we learned that there will be another review and assessment and further delay on introducing this measure.  <br\/><br\/>I refer to a question that was answered directly to me with regard to the 20-week anomaly scans.  I apologise for having so many questions but there were plenty in the submissions.  Louise Kenny from the Cork University Maternity Hospital appeared before this committee last week and she made a very clear statement about the need for the 20-week anomaly scans in terms of the risk to children and the risk to women, both to their health and to exposure to unnecessary interventions and procedures.  These are screening scans, so they are essential.  I asked on a few occasions when these scans will be available.  Can the witnesses put a date on it?  If they have not set a target for this, I strongly suggest they do so.  When will every woman in Ireland who wishes to be able to access that scan, or when can they ensure that the scans will be offered on a routine basis to women - as they are in most developed countries -  and available in all of the 19 sites?  I have asked about this a few times.  It is not something we need to review.There is a general acceptance among health professionals that these scans are necessary.  When we will see them being made available?<br\/><br\/>Mr. O'Brien got a big clap on the back for money management.  Does he think there will be a budget deficit in the HSE by the middle of the year?  Does he foresee there being a financial overrun by the end of this year?  I am interested to know if the HSE has a sufficient budget.  I put this question in the context of people being surprised by the outbreak of flu.  In the context of how Mr. O'Brien will organise the management of the money for the remainder of the year, does the HSE have a sufficient allocation? <br\/><br\/>In response to a question I asked, Mr. O'Brien stated that the waiting list action plans will be available by the end of February.  It is now 22 February and we are six days away from that date.  These are a series of plans.  Are they all being saved for the big day or has Mr. OBrien received them in stages?  Has he any information on the waiting list action plans that he might be able to share with us now?  If not, perhaps he could give a commitment to share those on the last day of February when they will all be magically received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#F00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

I wish to turn to my questions nos. 34 and 36.  Question no. 34 relates to the gynaecological services in Cork and about a time commitment.  I always get worried when we talk about setting up committees to review something.  One of the requests by the obstetricians and gynaecologists in Cork University Maternity Hospital was that a six-bed day-care unit would be opened.  What timescale would be involved for putting that in place?<\/p> <p>  My second issue relates to the waiting lists.  We had meetings in early January, but as I understand it no progress has been made in real terms in dealing with those waiting lists.  A total of 42% of all of the waiting lists for the entire country is in Cork University Maternity Hospital.  More than 4,000 women are involved.  I am concerned that we will be back here in two months time and no progress will have been made on that issue.  We might get clarification on deadlines and targets in dealing with that issue.<\/p> <p>  A further issue relates to the dermatology unit in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  It is treating double the number of patients being treated in the unit in St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.  I understand that the only space available for secretaries to work in the unit in the hospital in Cork is in under the stairs and patients are waiting on a stairway to go into clinics.  The response I got to this, and it is shortest one I have seen in regard to a major unit, both in terms of ENT and that dermatology unit, is to the effect that very little action will be taken regarding the difficulties they are dealing with.  Those in the unit have set out quite clear plans for what needs to be dealt with.  The staff are working extremely hard and they have even opened on Saturdays to deal with some of the issues to ensure a backlog does not develop.  The response I got is not adequate.  I wonder if some more progress can be made on it.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a further issue related to question no. 33, and I am intrigued by the answer I got to it.  It relates to the breakdown of staff in various departments of the HSE.  I am glad to note that the total number of staff has increased quite substantially but I wonder about our priorities in that area.  The total number of staff has increased to more than 107,000 from 99,000 in 2014.  I am glad to note that the number of care staff has increased by more than 2,142, from 16,000 to more than 18,000, but I am a little concerned that management and administrative staff have increased by 1,647.  I am also concerned about how those figures are presented to me today.  The annual report of the HSE in 2015 set out that the number of managers had increased from 4,700 to over 5,000 but I am told today that the figure is 1,445 because staff under grade 8 are being re-classified as not being in management.  Some massaging of figures is happening and people are not being honest with us.  How many staff members, who have moved up to grade 5, grade 6 and grade 7, are going under the radar in terms of the HSE being honest with us about this matter?  The number of administrative and management staff increased by 1,647 in two years.  The number of public health nurses increased by 39, from 1,460 to 1,499, in the same period.  In the past 12 months there has been a decrease in the number of public health nurses.<\/p><p>One imagines we should be prioritising the area to have people out in the community working to keep people out of the hospital services.  I am concerned about how we are approaching this.<\/p><p> We are the second highest spender on health in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, in real terms.  Are we making best use of funds and do we now need to do a detailed review of the management structure in the HSE?  An increase of 1,647 administrative staff members in two years is huge and I am not happy.  The 2015 annual report stated the number of managers went up by 300.  I am getting the response that it is not confirming what management increased by in real terms because the figures are being presented in a different way.  That is not fair to us or to anyone in the public.  We need the exact figures, presented in the same way that they were for the year ending 31 December 2015.  I ask for that to be clarified.<\/p><p> I have asked about forward planning in the HSE for recruitment of medical consultants and medical staff.  I thank the staff of the HSE for their work on it.  I have received a detailed presentation about doctors in each hospital.  That presentation was given to me in January 2014.  The last time I asked this, in November, I was told that the information was not available.  Surely this should be updated by the HSE every six months for forward planning?  It would establish the number of consultants who will retire over the next 12 months to two years in order that the positions can be advertised in advance and not after the consultant has walked out the door.  In the response, it shows there are 130 people in either locum positions as consultants or on an agency basis.  We should be able to avoid that if we do forward planning.  We do not appear to be doing it.  If one goes back to the old health boards, 15 or 20 years ago, there was forward planning for consultants retiring.  We abandoned that when the HSE was set up.  I ask that such a procedure and what we are given today be constantly reviewed every six months in order that management at senior level are aware of where the vacancies are likely to arise and the action that has to be taken.<\/p><p> I have just spoken to someone who came back from a medical conference in the United States last week, having met six registrars with whom the person had dealt and trained in Ireland but who now are working within 100 miles of one another in Canada.  We are losing some very good people because we are not doing enough forward planning.  I ask that this matter be focused on and for a review every six months in every hospital to make sure we can advertise in advance and not 12 months after the person has gone out the door.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for the work presented here today.  We need to review why 1,647 additional people entered administration and management in such a short period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#G00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

With the agreement of the committee, it might be best if I respond to whatever is appropriate for each person and then ask the director general to continue.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Kelly for his questions.  I know he has been championing better pathways for emergency departments for some time.  I think he is right.  I will ask the HSE to outline the increase it has already seen in the minor injury units this year compared with last year.  More needs to be done.  This needs to be looked at as part of the review of this winter, which I expect to start in March, to plan for next winter.  Is it about opening them longer, is there a benefit in opening them for longer and if opened for longer, would fewer people go in?  The next piece for the pathways is the new general practitioner, GP, contract, which I am sure we will get into later.  I know the Chairman has an interest in this.  Could GPs do more to prevent people from having to go to the emergency departments in the first place?<\/p> <p>  On the capital for both University Hospital Galway and Beaumont Hospital, I have announced funding for the design phase for an emergency department for University Hospital Galway.  That is an important part of the delivery of a capital project, as the Deputy knows from his own time in Cabinet.  I expect that will be done in time for the Galway project to be considered in the context of the capital plan.  A new emergency department for Galway is a priority.  It is in the programme for Government and the Government will have to reflect such priorities when it reviews the capital plan, which I expect to take place this summer.<\/p> <p>  Beaumont Hospital is funded for the design phase this year with a view to it being considered and acted upon in the mid-term capital review.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met the chief executive officer of Beaumont Hospital as recently as last week.  We saw ten extra beds open there which helped Beaumont quite a lot over the winter.  The Minister of State and I continue to pursue that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about Limerick.  I want to see this emergency department opened in Limerick as soon as it is completed.  I have given a commitment to work with colleagues in the HSE and the Department to ensure that happens.  Incredible work was being done by a brilliant staff and manager when I visited Limerick emergency department a number of months ago but in appalling infrastructural conditions.  The idea that there is going to be a brand new emergency department sitting empty is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#H00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>So the Minister is hoping to get it open?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#H00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I am working to try to fulfil that, as the Deputy has asked me to today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#H00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#H00600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I will take the South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel and Our Lady's Hospital Cashel together, since the Deputy and I visited both of them together.  The HSE and I believe we can do more in Cashel.  I will ask the HSE to comment on that.  I expect to receive a paper in the next couple of weeks about what we can do in Cashel while admitting that will require funding and it will be my responsibility to try to find that funding.  There has been a tender competition in Clonmel.  I will ask the HSE to update the Deputy on that.  Clonmel and Cashel have to be a priority and have to work together.  The Deputy asks if it should be a temporary offering or if a longer capital plan should be waited for.  If there is a temporary solution that can alleviate pressure in Clonmel, that should be progressed, because the situation in Clonmel is not acceptable.  I acknowledge that it has made good progress through its own efforts on overcrowding.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that the Deputy raised the issue of management because I did not get through all of my statement.  I have travelled to nearly every hospital in our health service and I have met some brilliant managers.  I do not accept that everybody is the same in any organisation.  There are some really good managers, and we want everybody to be really good.  The performance and accountability framework agreed with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health and the HSE talks about the four metrics against which a manager should be measured.  It includes such things as budgetary control, access to services, quality, safety and the harnessing of the workforce.  I have written to the director general and he will be reporting back to me shortly with an important piece of work on how that framework is being abided by and implemented by each manager.  I want to see a health service in which we point out excellence and say we would like more of that.  I could give a number of examples of excellence.  It is important that this becomes the norm and the expected benchmark across the health service.  That is what my comments were referring to.  They were not that all managers are bad because that is not my experience in the health service at all.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy picked an important issue on waiting lists and how we can be sure they are accurate.  I asked the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, through its audit function, to look at the waiting list practices in each of the hospitals that featured in the \"RTE Investigates\" programme.  That is prudent and an important step.  The NTPF is not an arm of the HSE.  It is an independent statutory agency that reports to me.<\/p> <p>  Validation is a word at which people sometimes shudder but if we are targeting limited resources, it is important that we know that the lists are accurate, that there are not people on the list twice, who are deceased or who have been referred to more than one consultant for the same procedure.  The individual health identifier proof of concept piece has a role to play in this as well.  It will be important if we can track everybody by individual health identifier, rather than by finding Mrs Murphy.<\/p> <p>  Funding is an issue for the national maternity strategy.  I know the Deputy is a strong advocate for it and that this committee has taken a big interest in it.  Extra funding was provided, some in the Deputy's own time, of &euro;2 million extra in 2015, &euro;3 million in 2016 and another &euro;6.8 million in 2017.  There is a need for more funding.<\/p><p>The Deputy has outlined some of the important related capital projects, including those associated with University Hospital Limerick, the Coombe, the Rotunda, and the move of the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street to St. Vincent's University Hospital, in respect of which move I hope and expect to be able to lodge a planning application in the coming days.  It is not just a question of funding.  With the exception of Holles Street, all have to be considered in the context of the capital plan.<\/p><p> It is also a question of implementation. The doctors and clinicians who appeared before the committee talked about that.  The new national women and infant health programme in the HSE is important.  One of the things we have done very well in this country was the cancer strategy.  It was implemented by my predecessors in the face of a lot of political opposition at the time.  The cancer control programme was set up as an independent, distinct body working within the HSE.  It had its own director and really drove change.  We now have a director appointed to head up the national women and infant health programme and implement the national maternity strategy.  The programme director is in place.  There will be a clinical director for that programme taking up office on 1 March.<\/p><p> I appreciate the raising of the national children's hospital because it provides me with an opportunity to clarify this.  I am frustrated that some of the information circulating on costs is somewhat misleading.  I have not received the definitive business case so I cannot confirm commercially sensitive figures.  It has not come to me to bring it to the Government.  I expect that to happen within a very short number of weeks.  It is currently with the HSE and is to go to my Department.  What I can say, however, and what is important to say is that the figure of &euro;650 million, which was referred to by the Committee of Public Accounts, was a core construction cost figure.  The documents at the time in question will show that it did not include equipment or the education facility for students, nor did it include some shared infrastructure and services to be used by St. James's Hospital in addition to the children's hospital.  It did not include retail.  Therefore, there are a number of issues that were not included in the &euro;650 million.  It did not include ICT but it was always expected that, at some point, we were going to arrive at this.  The &euro;650 million included the building of the children's hospital and the two satellite centres.  The other pieces need to be appraised by the Government.  The Government has yet to make a decision on this.  I expect to bring the definitive business case to the Government shortly.<\/p><p> People who are working very diligently on this project are accused, as professionals, of overruns, etc., and this is not fair.  If construction industry inflation were factored in at a rate of 3%, it would have a bearing on the matter.  According to the figures given to me, we are now, in 2017, seeing construction industry inflation of more than 9%.  It is absolutely right and proper that the Committee of Public Accounts scrutinises this entirely.  There is a very competent bunch of people heading up this project.  I look forward to being able to bring this matter to the Government shortly and sharing what is currently commercial information.  I hope I am being helpful in putting that information on the record of the committee.<\/p><p> I have corresponded with the Deputy on the ambulance service.  I will ask the HSE to answer the question further.  We are investing additional funding in our ambulance service this year.  The budget increased by over &euro;3 million this year but &euro;1 million of that is for new developments within the service.  <\/p><p> On scoliosis, the Deputy is right.  When I came to office, we did make targeted investments.  More than &euro;2 million was spent on scoliosis and 50 additional children and teenagers had procedures carried out in 2016 who otherwise would not have had them done.  There was outsourcing to other public hospitals and to private hospitals.  Was it enough?  No.  Should it have taken a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme?  No.  Did I mean it when I said I was ashamed?  Yes.  What are we going to do about it now?  We are going to have the action plan on scoliosis.  We are going to make sure that when people say theatres will be open in April, they will actually open.  We are going to share with this committee the action plan on scoliosis at the end of this month to show how we are going to arrive at a point where no child or teenager will wait longer than four months by the end of this year.<\/p><p> On the issue of Orkambi, I understand it is still being considered by the HSE leadership team.  The legislation in 2013 was very clear.  The HSE has to make a decision.  If there is a funding requirement, the question of where it will be found is my responsibility.  I am awaiting to hear about this.  I hope and expect the consideration of the matter will not go on for long.  Patients need certainty and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#H00700","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>What about the other drug, Respreeza?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#J00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I will ask the HSE to comment but I understand the HSE leadership made a decision on that.

I think it is quite a robust reporting structure.  I have met the chairman of the board and other members of the board on three occasions in the ten-month period since I became Minister.  The Department of Health is liaising closely with the NTPF, which is a statutory agency of the Department.  I have made my point about the board of the NTPF.  I apologise if I picked up the question wrongly.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's suggestion about the waiting list system, I endeavoured to deal with this matter constructively in the Seanad last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#K04200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I want to come back to the NTPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#K04300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Sorry.

The origin of this dialogue is the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  Last year's stretch target was &euro;50 million in total; this year it is &euro;44 million.  The acute system delivered in terms of its total target as anticipated.  Specific comment was also made in last year's HSE service plan, which carries into this, that any shortfall would not lead to reduced service and we are clear about that.

Many of the HSE's technology proposals, including the electronic health record and so on, will support waiting list management because they are all about scheduling patient care and flow.

I have been attending the committee for four years.  For three of those, the only consistent theme has been the kicking of the HSE and the various people who work for it on budgetary matters.  It is reasonable in the first year there has been a virtual break-even situation that I would acknowledge the work that has been done by people throughout the system to achieve that and, in particular, the decisions made by the Oireachtas around the funding of the HSE in 2016 which enabled that to occur.

I will reiterate the two points I made at the launch of the service plan.  Given the scale of the service, it is worth noting that there is no provision for contingency.  That is a standard in the way we fund public bodies.  Should there be a significant unforeseen public health emergency, therefore, we do not retain a separate fund for that.  That would be something we would have to report to the Minister on if we encountered that.  In the context of the enormous appetite for pay restoration and so on, the service plan does not currently provide for that.

In fairness, we must be honest with ourselves in terms of what can be achieved when it comes to budgets.  Some of the service plans that were forced on the HSE - as opposed to being presented by it - in recent years were not achievable and inevitably we ended up with cutbacks at the end of every year.<\/p> <p>  I highlight these issues because they are important.  In orthopaedics, for example, full surgical teams were on stand-by yet there were cancellations of all hip implant surgery due to there being no implants.  That is the reality of what was happening in recent years.  It was not Mr. O'Brien's fault or the fault of the HSE, it was due to a lack of planning and foresight.  Sometimes the Department of Health is a bit like Lord Cardigan in blaming somebody else.  We must be honest with ourselves.  It is easy to consistently criticise the HSE and sap it of its capacity to deal with the challenges.  We must be careful in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of private patients in public beds.  There is a perverse incentive at stake in that a hospital can now charge private patients in any public bed.<\/p><p>There is no doubt there is a perverse incentive for private patients to be treated in public hospitals because hospital management is under significant pressure with regard to budgets, and consultants will get paid by the private health insurance companies.  If there was not, the Government would not have changed the legislation.  It was changed for budgetary purposes which was quite evident at the time.<br\/><br\/>I remember listening to the speeches and the rationale behind it.  It was changed for budgetary purposes to incentivise and encourage private patients to be treated in public beds.  Prior to that, there was a 20% designation.  At the same time as we have private patients being treated in public hospitals, we have public patients who cannot get into the public hospitals for treatment.  There has to be a revaluation of that moral dilemma.  Private patients should be treated in private hospitals, unless there is clinically no other way.  The purpose of private health insurance is that private health patients go to private hospitals which, in turn, frees up capacity in the public hospital for public patients.  At the very least, there should be an independent assessment of whether there has been a major increase in the volume of private patients going through public hospitals, thereby reducing capacity for public patients in public hospitals.  I have many consultants, insurance companies and private health care providers informing me it is happening.  And they are all wrong?  It is a perverse incentive, as was outlined at the time during the change of policy in the Health (Amendment) Act.<br\/><br\/>The Minister referred to the bed capacity review as an important part of the planning process, looking over the horizon, taking into account demographics, changes in medical practice and all that flows from the modernisation of medical services.  The other important issue in this context is workforce planning.  This would have to be looked at in tandem.  Otherwise, there is not much point in having a load of beds and no nurses or <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>At one stage, there was a proposal to have a new grade called theatre assistant like they have in the United States and elsewhere.  There was a lot of resistance to it, however.  One of the major problems identified in the delays with scoliosis and other orthopaedic operations in Crumlin hospital and elsewhere was the lack of theatre nurses.  Where are we with regard to the setting up of this new grade?  Has it fallen by the wayside because of resistance or for other reasons?<br\/><br\/>With regard to waiting lists and accountability, the Minister referred to gynaecology and obstetrics in Cork and elsewhere.  We have committed consultants and professionals across the health service, as well as committed administrators and management.  At some stage, however, reasons have to be given as to why we have inordinate delays in some hospitals and not in others.  It is important there is absolute transparency with regard to waiting lists across the whole of the Health Service Executive, HSE, including with consultants.  The public is entitled to know that if one goes to X hospital, one will wait so long, while if one goes to Y, one will wait a different time.  This allows comparisons to be done.  With comparisons come competitiveness and accountability and all that flows from that.<br\/><br\/>This question is for Mr. Jim Breslin.  The National Association for General Practitioners represents 1,600 GPs, while the IMO, Irish Medical Organisation, represents about two thirds, if not half, of that number.  As it stands, the National Association for General Practitioners is outside the door while the IMO negotiates with the Department on the most important contractual discussions to take place in 40 odd years and which will set down the bedrock of health care delivery in the primary care setting.  It is extraordinary the majority involved are not even sitting down to discuss the matter.  Why is the Department speaking with the smaller organisation when it should be speaking with the larger one?  It would be like going into Parliament to talk to the smallest parties as opposed to the largest party.  It beggars belief.<br\/><br\/>We all hope that society will buy into the national children's hospital and it will be a beacon of a modern state, delivering modern care to the people we should cherish most.  I hope every effort is made by the Minister, the Government and those charged with the responsibility of ensuring the national children's hospital is represented, that there is a voice for it, it is not delayed any further and it is not undermined by misinformation or a lack of information.<br\/><br\/>I met some of the parents of the children with scoliosis who are on waiting lists and I raised it in the D&aacute;il in November 2016.  The &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme touched everybody.  One would have to have a heart of stone not to have been touched by it.  Why is the system so inactive and cold to that call which was going on for a long time with regard to this particular issue?  I accept there are many challenges to and draws on HSE resources.  However, a system would want to be wholly inflexible and lack any compassion not to have responded to this matter in advance of the RTE programme.  We need to be conscious of that.  Delaying surgery for an inordinate period, which had a negative impact on people's health, did not rest easy with the public.  It should not rest easy with a system which allowed it happen in the first place.<br\/><br\/>On the broader review of maternity and cardiac services, as well as broader services in general, when the capital programme is being assessed, are all the strategies underpinning the various deliveries of health care assessed first and then the capital plan put on top of that to ensure we have continuity of strategy?  There have been concerns in the past, not just for the past six years, that there can be undue influence from a political perspective as to where capital spending should go when it should be based on what is required by the health services, as opposed to what is required by a political party or a Minister of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#M02000","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Billy Kelleher for his-----.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#N00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Short, brief and concise contribution, unlike previous speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#N00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>He hit it on the button.

Management structures within the HSE should contain people with clinical experience, though not necessarily doctors, and they should make the decisions.  By having administrators who are not bound by any medical ethics, we ended up in the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is a shame that this was exposed on \"Prime Time\" and that the Minister had to intervene.  I commend him on his intervention and I have great hope for the unit being opened.  Ireland and I thank him for that.  It is shameful that this happened under the watch of Mr. O'Brien and I have to question his ability to do the job in this regard.<\/p><p> I find it difficult to understand why all the management and staff of the HSE were thanked today for their wonderful work when no company, except maybe one in a small cottage industry, can be said to have staff who are all operating to the best of their ability.

We discussed the national maternity hospital last week and found that many hospitals were only scanning high-risk women.  Professor Kenny from Cork stated that, in 1% of cases, there were structural defects in the non-risk group, amounting to 230 children born in this country every year with problems that were not identified pre-birth.  There are catastrophic outcomes, while in other cases it all works out, but doctors and midwives are being put in a very awkward position where a child is born in a regional hospital with a problem that could have been identified prenatally.  This causes huge stress to families, has bad outcomes for our children and costs a huge amount of money to limit the damage and transfer the babies to Dublin hospitals for surgery.  It is a shocking statistic for a country this size and it is shameful.  What is the HSE going to do about it?<\/p> <p>  There is a spiralling rate of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and more severe forms of encephalopathy, but two thirds are preventable.  One child per week is born with a severe birth defect that could have been prevented with adequate prenatal nutrition, one of the cheapest being folic acid which costs a pittance at &euro;2 for a box of 50 to prevent the commonest preventable major congenital anomaly worldwide.  It is a pity that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, has left.  Dr. Boylan, who is the expert and was here last week, said that the solution was fortification of foodstuffs with folic acid.  People may not want it but it is a water-soluble vitamin and there no issues with men having it by accident as it is harmless to them.  We have been talking about birth defects and scans but if we could prevent things from happening in the first place there would be knock-on effects for families and costs in the health service.  In light of the &euro;13.5 million spend to which Mr. O'Brien referred, can we not try to cut costs while at the same time having better outcomes for families?<\/p> <p>  How much public money is being spent in 2017 on disability services?  Will the Minister of State give an indication of where the money is to be spent?  Perhaps he could send us a note in reply.  Will he also give us an update on the Grace case?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Woods spoke of portable solutions.  Will he elaborate on those?  I see caravans and trailers but maybe I am wrong.  These things are short-term fixes to massive problems.  The data show that we have huge demographic pressures and this seems to be a Band-Aid policy.  I do not get why we are going for portable solutions and I find them quite disturbing.  Pre-made units were brought into Crumlin some seven years ago.<\/p><p>They literally came on the back of a truck and they had to be plumped in.  I believe that happened about seven years ago.  Is that the sort of portable solution or is it akin to the library that used to come to us in the van years ago in Westmeath?  I am wondering what is a portable solution.

Obviously, there is a hospital like Bantry General Hospital in every constituency.  That hospital is a really good and well-run hospital, but is obviously starved of funding.  As I pointed out to the Minister in the D&aacute;il already, with a little bit of funding it could do amazing things and could ease up the whole waiting list saga in Cork city.<\/p> <p>  What are the Minister's plans to ensure people are enticed to apply for GP positions etc.?  As far as I know, some positions are getting no applications.  Obviously, something is wrong and something needs to be done.  What are the Minister's plans to entice people to apply and obviously to keep them, particularly in rural areas?  A big campaign was run last year to entice nurses to come home from abroad.

As the Chairman knows, I am a very simple country boy and have simplistic solutions to everything, including some of the complicated issues raised by Deputy Kelleher.<\/p> <p>  I see two issues.  First, there is overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  This has occurred every year for the past ten years with no change.  The same applies to waiting lists for elective surgery despite the corrective measures.  I welcome all the measures that have taken place and the extra funding made available in the current year over last year and the proposals for the future.<\/p> <p>  Regarding overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, what research has gone into the reason for the persons being there in the first place?  Have they come of their own volition?  Have they come following referral from their GPs or have they come as a result of being on a waiting list for elective surgery for a period of two or three years, or whatever the case may be?  I would like precise answers to those questions because I believe I know the answers to them.<\/p> <p>  When a patient first presents for elective surgery, to what extent has an examination been done as to whether at any given time there is sufficient capacity in the system to deal with the volume?  It is simple mathematics.  I know people will tell me it is not possible to interrelate mathematics and medicine, but there is a certain merit in it.<\/p> <p>  We appear to be closing down step-down beds in the public sector.  This has happened gradually over the past 15 years on the basis of health and safety and so forth.  I know the institutions concerned.  I was on the visiting committee of some such institutions previously.  I cannot understand why that is happening.  It surely would be of huge benefit at this time to try to make available the maximum number of those beds at a time when beds are at a premium in the public hospital system.<\/p> <p>  Why was it not possible to identify the extent of the urgency of the particular scoliosis cases without having to wait for an investigative programme by RTE?  Surely it was known to everybody along the line that there were a number of patients in the system.  Their individual suffering is not recognised by everybody because we do not all know where it is happening.  However, somebody knew what was happening and decided to put them on a waiting list.  As the Chairman will know, this arises all the time with hip replacements.  It is not unusual to find a person hobbling along with one crutch, having suffered in silence for a long period of time,  eventually being told, \"Sorry, there's a problem; we had a bed for you yesterday but we won't have one again for two months.\"<\/p> <p>  There is an examination of capacity.  What is the optimum required to address the accident and emergency department problems, from where the patients are coming and the hospital problems in terms of waiting lists?  Is it due to a lack of surgical facilities, such as theatres and theatre staff?  For example, in the past 24 hours I have dealt with a case where a serious operation was scheduled to take place, but had to be postponed because of a lack of theatre staff.  It was an urgent procedure involving a child.  Parents and patients of whatever age are vulnerable.  That should identify the scale of what is required to provide the services for the next three years.<\/p><p>We should not have a shortfall the following year.  We should address the issue, identify the core problem and deal with it.  That may mean increasing the services dramatically to cater for our population.  When people tell me we have an ageing population I feel sensitive about it and look in the mirror.  There is also a very young population contributing tax to the system.  I would like a comment on that.<\/p><p> It is very obvious that if a person discovers a particular drug can have a dramatic impact on his or her condition, he or she will want to have it.  That the person is in his or her little world and reaching out for something to alleviate the pain is a natural reaction.  I know the Minister and the HSE have done some work on this recently but we live in a single market.  If the drugs are approved, available and paid for in Milan, Berlin or other places, they should be available here too at the same cost.  The European market is 500 million people.  It is more lucrative for a drug company to deal with that number than to deal with three or seven million.  How much time and energy do we devote to ensuring we get the benefits of being part of the 500 million?<\/p><p> Why was it not possible to identify the full extent of the waiting lists in our hospitals?  We have asked that question several times.  RTE was able to discover it in a couple of hours or that is how it looks to me.  The information does not seem to filter down to the area that matters, and if it does not, there is a problem.  It cannot and will not be dealt with until that happens.<\/p><p> Everybody thought it was a good idea to centralise the services.  I never believed it was a good idea.  This is not a criticism of the HSE but I never believed it was the appropriate body to deliver services nationwide and it is not.  The people working in the medical card section are decent people and work very hard where there is a huge demand.  I cannot understand how a cancer patient may have to wait while bank details and other documents are submitted and the patient's condition is deteriorating.  Nobody seems to think about that.  It would be quite simple to issue the medical card in the first instance.  Safeguarding the patient should be the priority.<\/p><p> I could go on and on.  If we can get the answers to some of my questions and to those my colleagues have put, we will solve health service problems we have been trying to deal with over the past ten to 15 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#P01300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":612,"content":"<p>In the interests of efficiency I will answer the questions that are relevant to me and ask the HSE to come in.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher is correct that the policy of treating private patients in public beds should be kept under review.  It arose when there was no mechanism for private patients to be charged, which was not equitable in a public health service.  On foot of his sincere interest, and it is a prudent thing to do, I will ask the Department of Health to produce a report on this matter, how it has grown and its impact on bed numbers, and I will share it with the Deputy and this committee.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to hear the Deputy refer to bed capacity being tied to recruitment because I have consistently heard people on the airwaves saying time and again that if they had more beds, the crisis would be solved.  That is not a fitting comment for some of those people because they know that in their own hospitals beds are closed - for example, there were 90 closed yesterday - due to staff shortages.  While I accept there is a bed capacity issue, the beds of themselves are not a realistic answer.  Only beds that can be staffed are a solution.  The two must go hand in hand.  The bed capacity review should be able to inform the recruitment needs of the health service.<\/p> <p>  Theatre assistants are a sensitive issue.  This is a sensitive time for industrial relations and engagement with unions in the health sector but I hope that in the context of the public service pay talks, new grades in the health service will be considered seriously.  In other countries theatres function well with fewer nurses and other assistants.  That enables the nurses to deploy their skills more appropriately in the acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The comments on waiting lists are fair because there is a role for management and one for consultants.  We have to get away from the idea that the consultant owns the patient to the extent that until the consultant sees the patient who has been referred to him or her, the patient cannot have a procedure.  We saw a good example of what I describe as pooling in the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, RCSI, hospital group, which includes Beaumont, Cavan and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, such that if a patient was offered a procedure in Beaumont but there was no capacity there, it would be offered in Cavan or Louth.  As a result, waiting lists in this hospital group reduced significantly compared with other hospital groups.  Deputy O'Reilly&rsquo;s integrated waiting list approach supports this.  Pooling and using the group structure to maximise capacity will have to be a priority for our waiting list efforts in 2017.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, it is not for me to adjudicate on who has the most members nor is it for me to adjudicate on why there are two different organisations or a doctor joins one or both, as many general practitioners I meet tell me they have.  On taking office I said, and I meant it sincerely, that there is a need for the GP contract discussions to be inclusive.  The process I have put in place, following advice from officials, consideration and engagement, is much more inclusive than any we have had on general practitioner, GP, matters.  In the past the NAGP was left out in the cold, looking in the window, as it were.  In this process the IMO, which has a long-standing history of negotiating as a representative body and has a framework agreement, not one signed by me but signed by the Department of Health and the IMO, is negotiating a new contract with the NAGP being afforded a formal consultative status that it has never before had.  I have received correspondence from this committee on that but I am trying to balance the need to ensure the process is as inclusive as possible with ensuring my Department honours an agreement and framework already in place.  I would say to the NAGP that this process enables it to have a greater role than ever in any discussion on any matter to do with general practice and the Department of Health.  I will meet the NAGP in the coming weeks and will tell it to take that step and build on that.  A new GP contract is crucial but I have to respect a framework agreement with the IMO and show willingness to ensure the voice of the NAGP and its members is heard.  I am trying to get that balance right in an appropriate manner that enables us to deliver a new GP contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#Q00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Who is resisting putting them in the same room?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#R00100","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":614,"content":"<p>All these people are terribly grown up.

However, we must also work out a mechanism whereby we make sure all GPs have a voice in the process.  I would argue that if one considers my comments on this issue and indeed my actions, specifically a willingness to have formal consultative status bestowed on the NAGP as a building block, it reflects very favourably on the position taken by my predecessors regarding the NAGP.  This is a step on a road and it should be taken in the interests of patients.  The GPs I meet all around the country say they are members of both bodies.  I want to make sure people's voices are heard but I must operate within the constraints of a framework agreement and another body that also wants to be involved.  This is the best model I can come up with, on the advice of my officials, to make sure we fulfil the various competing priorities in this regard.<\/p><p>Regarding the issue of the national children's hospital, to which Deputy Kelleher referred, we have heard much in this committee and others about its location.  It is important to say that I have statements of support in front of me in respect of St. James's Hospital and getting on with co-locating with that hospital.  The statements are signed by the group clinical director of the Children's Hospital Group; the clinical director of the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght; the chief director of nursing of the Children's Hospital Group; the clinical director of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin; the clinical director of Temple Street Children's University Hospital; the director of nursing of the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght Hospital; the director of nursing at Temple Street Children's University Hospital; and the director of nursing at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I have seen the statement of support from the three professors of paediatrics in the three Dublin universities, who collectively support the campus at St. James's.  They are Professor Owen Smith of UCD, Eleanor Molloy of TCD and Alf Nicholson of the RCSI group.  Therefore, while the debate on the site has been ongoing for so long, many a clinician in this country has put pen to paper to endorse it.  I agree with Deputy Kelleher that they need to get on with the project as quickly as possible.  This is exactly what I want to do.  I want to be able to let every member of the Houses and, much more importantly, every taxpayer and parent in this country see exactly the cost behind this hospital.  However, I ask people to take on board the comments I have made today on the fact that the &euro;650 million figure and the other figures in the media do not compare apples with apples.  When I receive the definite business case, I will do my own due diligence.  I will bring it to Cabinet and present it to the Houses and to members of this committee.<\/p><p>I wish to assure Deputy Kelleher regarding the capital plan.  Yes, priorities in the plan need to align with the priorities of the health service and the plans the health service has for the delivery of a number of its strategies.  I agree with the Deputy in this regard.<\/p><p>Most of Deputy O'Connell's questions were for the HSE.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, is not here to respond to the issue raised of folic acid.  Deputy O'Connell is probably aware that <i>safe<\/i>food ran an award-winning campaign called &quot;Babies Know the Facts About Folic&quot; in 2015, the evaluation of which is under way to try to inform a new campaign for 2017.  I take the point Deputy O'Connell makes and I will ask Deputy Corcoran Kennedy to revert to her directly.  The 2015 campaign was designed to address the increasing rate of neural tube defects and aimed to communicate the need for all sexually active women to take folic acid daily, whether or not they are planning a pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#R00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, I am a community pharmacist.

I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, to liaise with her directly on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony is a WhatsApp fan.  I thank her for her question.  I thought I had walked into the wrong meeting when she was discussing WhatsApp, leadership contests and so on.  While one cannot account for certain colleagues' sense of humour or lack thereof, I assure her that my priority, regardless of any decisions made in my party or by me personally, remains.  I am doing this job to the very best of my ability and working with Members across the Houses to do so.  I hope both the Secretary General and director general will continue to see that in my work rate in the Department of Health and my interactions with the HSE.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Bantry General Hospital, an issue Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has raised with me on the floor of the D&aacute;il, I make the point that there must be a bright future for our smaller hospitals.  We must consider utilising all capacity within the health service.  While there will always be certain specialties and issues of acuity that are best dealt with in larger hospitals and centres of excellence, using every piece of capacity must be what we are about.  The hospital group structure affords this opportunity to explore how best to use it.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Deputy Murphy O'Mahony raised the issue of what we do about a part of the country which, no matter how a post is advertised or a GP sought, still finds itself without a GP.  Again, I know the Chairman was - and indeed still is - very much involved in the No Doctor No Village campaign before he was elected to the D&aacute;il and I know this issue is very strongly felt in parts of rural Ireland.  I contend, though, that it is also an issue in areas of urban deprivation, whereby the business model of being a self-employed general practitioner may never quite stack up but the societal and health needs of a doctor and a medical practice in such an area is compelling.  This is why, as part of the GP contract negotiations, we will consider salaried GPs and how one supports funding GPs where the business model does not work.<\/p> <p>  I have heard about the issue of nurses and the feedback on the NMBI and registration times from a number of people and I am engaging on the matter.  I want to hear from the NMBI about this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked the director general of the HSE to keep in touch with her regarding the issue of Respreeza.  I am sure he will.  He was only out of the room momentarily.  From my perspective, there are two parts to this.  The first part is that we need to follow the law of the land on any drug, and the law of the land says the drugs committee considers something and the HSE makes then a decision.  The drugs committee is made up of clinicians.  It is important clinicians make decisions and not Ministers.  The law, since 2013, is that the HSE leadership team makes a decision whether to reimburse.  Sometimes it will make the decision to reimburse but will not have the money and will ask the Minister what he or she will is going to do about it.  That is the legal process.  The second part - I do not ever intend to stop saying this as long as I am in this job - is that the issue of drug companies and how they engage with the taxpayer and the patient through their representatives is very important.  We cannot have price-gouging.  I am not talking specifically about Respreeza.  No matter how big the health budget is, it will always be a limited pot, very difficult decisions will always need to be made and we need to continually, as public representatives, make sure in our representations that the pressure is not all one way.  The pressure should not be merely on the HSE to provide funding; the pressure must also be on the drugs company, and the question of what it is going to do must be asked.  I suggest that sometimes on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber, while people for absolutely the best reasons rise to ask about the availability of a drug, this only ends up inadvertently increasing the price the drug company demands for the drug.  This is a challenge we must all balance.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the HSE to respond to Deputy Durkan's technical questions about the research being carried out and the kinds of patients turning up.  I am asking these questions because if we are to break this vicious cycle of overcrowding which, as the Deputy said, has been ongoing for a decade or more, we must get to the bottom of it.  For what it is worth, though, I think we need to consider how we decouple our emergency department attendances from our elective procedures.  Currently, when one gets really busy, it directly impacts on the ability to do the other.  This leads to waiting lists.  Therefore, as part of the capital plan, we should consider how we can increase capacity to carry out more elective procedures, separate and distinct to the acute hospital.  I was in Galway the other day.  The people of Galway rightly want a new emergency department.  The current situation is appalling.  However, they also ask whether another site, Merlin Park, can be used to carry out some of their elective procedures.  This is the way we need the health service to think.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan's comments on the Single Market and drugs.  I raised this with the European health commissioner when I met him in Brussels about three weeks ago and I have already signalled to him my intention to put this on the agenda for the next meeting of EU health Ministers.<\/p><p>Industry is very organised in terms of collaborating but member states are not.  As a result, our patients and taxpayers are suffering somewhat.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will respond to the questions relevant to his remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#R00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions on disability issues.  I also thank and commend my colleagues on their support in regard to the issue.  Disability is not just a health issue.  It is a broader issue for all of us and we should all focus on it.  Last Monday, on a visit to the Brothers of Charity Services in Galway, I visited a centre where I met a group of small business owners who a year ago set themselves a target of creating 100 new real jobs for people with disabilities under the EmployAbility project of the Department of Social Protection.  On that occasion, I was invited to open an envelope and read out the result of their effort.  The result was that they had created 101 new jobs in small businesses across Galway.  As I said, disability is an issue that crosses all Departments and every aspect of all of our lives.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kate O'Connell asked about expenditure on disability services under this year's social care disability service plan.  It is important that everybody would be aware, particularly my colleagues in opposition, that under budget 2017, &euro;1.688 billion will be spent on disability services, which is an increase of 6%.  In regard to the Deputy's question on where this money will be spent, the spend will be on 8,400 residential places, 182 respite over-nights, 1.4 million personal assistant hours for 2,400 people, 24,800 day places, 41,000 day respite sessions and 2.75 million home support hours for 7,500 people.  These are the key aspects of the plan.  Spending on emergency cases in 2017 will be &euro;16.2 million in support of 395 people and 185 emergency residential places.  Under the new home support scheme, home respite for emergency cases is being increased to 210.  In other words, rather than people going into respite care outside of their homes the respite care will be provided in the home, giving parents and so on a break.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to new directions and school leavers, major progress has been made in respect of 18 year olds and &euro;10 million has been provided to support 1,500 18 year olds in day service supports.  There has been major progress in this area in the last 12 months.  In a lot of areas, 100% of the issues have been resolved and in others 93% to 97% of the issues have been resolved.  In terms of the move from congregated settings, &euro;100 million in capital funding has been provided for the next five years, which equates to &euro;20 million per annum.  This means that this year, 223 people will be moved to community living and 50 additional homes will be purchased.  That is how money allocated to the disabilities area is being spent.  We need to ensure that it is spent wisely.  I have a vision and a plan for this area.  There is also a strategy in place for the disabilities area.  We need to ensure the focus is on the person with the disability.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell also asked about the \"Grace\" case.  The Government is committed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry.  There will be no fudge on this issue.  I was annoyed by some of the commentary of Members of the Oireachtas and others in the media on this issue.  That commentary is wrong.  We are all committed to Grace and any other victim of alleged sexual abuse.  I intend to get the truth, justice and action.  Some actions have already commenced even though the commission of inquiry has not yet commenced.  The Conal Devine report and Resilience Ireland report addressed this issue.  These reports were then examined by Mr. Conor Dignam, who then drafted the terms of reference for the inquiry.  I recently cleared those terms of reference with the HSE.  The HSE intends to publish the Resilience Ireland report and Conal Devine report next Tuesday.  The terms of reference for the inquiry is currently being examined by the Attorney General's office.  As I said, there will be no fudging on this issue.  In the meantime, a number of schemes are in place around safeguarding vulnerable adults in institutions.  We also have a national policy on safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse, a top-class safeguarding committee chaired by Professor Patricia Rickard-Clarke and a confidential recipient, Leigh Gath.  There is a lot of working going on in regard to the protection of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony raised the two very important issues of delays in assessments and the lack of therapies.  I share the Deputy's concerns.  There has been a major reconfiguration of HSE disabilities services over the last number of years.  So far, &euro;8 million in funding has been made available to support 200 additional posts.  Prior to Christmas, an additional &euro;4 million was provided to support the filling of the 75 vacant therapy posts.  There are some gaps in the system and some problems around recruitment of staff in particular areas, including Dublin.  I acknowledge that, as identified by the Deputy, there are gaps in Cork, Waterford and Offaly.  We need to do more.  I am working closely with the HSE and the Department to ensure that full implementation of progressing disability services takes place by the end of 2017.  <\/p> <p>  On the UN convention, this issue has moved on a stage as well.  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was brought to Cabinet before Christmas and Second Stage of the Bill commenced just after Christmas.  I had expected the Second Stage debate to conclude last week but because of other events of which Members will be aware, there were changes to the D&aacute;il schedule.  That debate is scheduled to take place later tonight such that I hope the Bill can progress to the next Stage.  We are determined to ratify the UN convention but we want to do it properly.  We are way ahead of some of the other countries that have already ratified it in that we already have in place a lot of the services which they propose to put in place.  As I said, we will ratify the convention because it is important that we do so.  The delay in this regard is related in part to the issues which arose around the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and issues around deprivation of liberty.  I appeal to colleagues to work with me to ensure conclusion of the Second Stage debate on the Bill tonight such that we can progress it through Committee Stage and enacted as soon as possible.  Much of what happens in regard to ratification of the convention is dependent on members.  As Minister of State, I am determined to ensure that we ratify it.<\/p> <p>  I would like to clarify a point I made earlier regarding the terms of reference for the inquiry.  I have cleared the terms of reference with the Department of Health, not the HSE.  I hope I have responded to all of the questions relevant to my remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#S00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487770200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Woods to respond to Deputy Durkan's question on the issue of demand and capacity and to Deputy O'Connell's question regarding the definition of a portable solution.<\/p> <p>  On private health insurance, the issue raised by Deputy Kelleher is an important one.  However, it is important to bear in mind that although the level of utilisation of private health insurance has fluctuated little over the last decade, it currently stands at around 50% of the population.  The private health care sector in Ireland is not big enough to meet the demands for services of that proportion of a population.  In addition, there are a wide range of services that are best provided currently from the multidisciplinary university level teaching hospitals that are in the public sector, particularly trauma and some major interventions.  In the context of what is happening now, patients who present with private health insurance and who consent to so do generate a bill to their private health insurer.<\/p><p>In the past, whether a bill could be raised was entirely dependent on the fairly antiquated and out-of-date designated beds process.  This meant that in many instances the public health system was not recouping any income for patients who were being treated privately.

The notion that all privately-insured patients could and should be directed to private hospitals is not a realistic option at present.

The Deputy is correct in what he says.  However, I do not know that it was done to incentivise a growth in private practice.  It was done for budgetary purposes because, as Mr. O'Brien said, there were private patients in public hospitals whose consultants were getting a fee for treating them on a private basis, but the public hospitals were getting nothing.  The implication of that was the public system was subsidising the private one.  The policy decision was made to try to remove that subsidy, and have the private patients bear the cost of their treatment in the public hospital.  Private health insurers sometimes equate that with whether one gets a private bed or not but the bed is the cheapest part of one's stay in hospital and it is all the things done to one that account for the majority of expense.  At present private patients in a public hospital, regardless of their position in that hospital, is being charged for the cost of their treatment, or at least an approximation of the cost of the treatment.  That was done to remove a subsidy and there was a good bit of policy work done around that.  That is a separate issue as to whether private patients should continue in public hospitals in the future.  That is a big call.  I think that is for the Committee on the Future of Healthcare to decide on, and to examine the repercussions of that.  The policy rationale for the legislation was to remove a subsidy.

There are two types of solutions for which we have tendered that would allow hospitals and hospital groups to move more quickly than potentially bricks and mortar-type solutions.  One is a solution where a third party provider may arrive on site, bring a facility and operate that within the public environment.  The other is where a facility is provided and the staff come from within the current health sector employment or through some growth in that.  The intention is simply to provide a short-term flexible option while the longer-term discussions around capacity are under way.  It is not intended to replace or in any way supplant that and, indeed, it would not have that capacity.  However, there are a small number of interesting proposals that hospitals have looked at that would give them protected scheduled care and, in  particularl, protected day care space.  There is such a proposal for Merlin Park in Galway.  We want to try to create some central support for that kind of initiative.  The intention of the framework agreement was to leave the groups in a place where they could flexibly consider that as part of response to both waiting list and demand.<\/p> <p>  There is a strong place for mathematics in health, as the Deputy rightly implies.  We have population health doctors and epidemiologists whose job it is to study the nature of demand and the changing nature of demand.  We have commissioned and received reports on trends in emergency work, in elective work and, indeed, the source of admissions, that is, the percentage of people that may come through a GP or by direct walk-in.  Around 47% of people nationally go through a GP first, but there is a lot of variation.

We have been here for three hours now.<\/p><p>I would like to go back to the Minister's reference to the GP contract negotiations.  As he knows, the committee wrote to him following a meeting two weeks ago stating that there was a strong feeling within the committee that both groups should be given equal status and parity of esteem within those contract negotiations.  The Minister has referenced the framework document again today, which seems to be an inhibiting factor in terms of allowing both groups to have equal status.  This GP contract will underpin general practice for perhaps the next 20 or 30 years.  It will be the central component of moving from hospital-centred care to primary-centred care and it will most likely be a GP-led primary-centred service, particularly dealing with chronic illness.  If we are to have the best outcome of those contract negotiations, we feel it is essential that both groups have equal status.  This is about the patient and getting him or her the best service.  We need to get the best contract to give the patient the best service.  In that context, will the Minister tell us the reason the framework document is inhibiting equal status for both groups?  Unless both groups are involved in the negotiations, we will not get the best contract and outcome for patients.<\/p><p> The topic of governance has arisen in many of the committee's hearings.  Will the Minister outline how the Department interacts with the HSE in terms of governance, accountability, transparency and responsibility?  For instance, the maternity strategy was discussed at this committee on two occasions.  Our maternity hospitals in Dublin have a mastership model of governance while our maternity structures do not have that autonomy of governance.  Professor Kenny feels that if they had the same autonomy of governance in Cork as is to be found in the maternity hospitals in Dublin, which have the mastership model, they could improve the quality of service they provide to their patients, including the shortening or elimination of waiting lists.  We expect clinical excellence of our clinicians, but we must also have managerial excellence from our managers.  Deputy Kate O'Connell referred to doctors having an ethical responsibility to do their best.  How can we ensure that our managers have the same responsibility to deliver excellent outcomes?  We need a governance that is transparent and accountable.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien and the Minister would address those issues.<\/p><p> I call Senator John Dolan, who will be followed by Senator Keith Swanick and Senator Kieran O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#T02000","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, his team and the HSE team for the answers I received to the questions I had submitted.  I had four questions.  I wish to commend the Department of Health, which I think, sadly, is the only Department so far to mention its public sector duty in its statement of strategy.  I consider that critical.  The Department picked up on that as well in terms of the UN convention and treating those with disabilities and mental health issues on an equal basis.  I underline and appreciate that point.  Those are leads that could be followed by other Departments and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, may be in a position to make that point to others as he is going along.<\/p> <p>  My first question concerned the statement of strategy, particularly where it stated that it would develop policies and proposals to promote community-based supports including innovative enhanced housing options.  My question asked what kind of policies were in place and there was a pretty decent answer to it.  That said, there was a lot of detail about processes and structures but there are still almost 4,000 people with disabilities on the social housing waiting list for the past four years.  People might ask what this has to do with health.  However, the connection between those with disabilities and health is that they are stuck in congregated settings.  Men and women of 35 years and 40 years of age are living at home with their parents, which is not acceptable.  These are interlinking issues.  I note the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, regarding congregated settings.  However, even if more than 200 are taken out of those settings this year, the answer I received suggested that one third of the total number which, off the top of my head, I think is approximately 2,700 will be moved by 2020, but there is still another two thirds.  This does not seem to me to be a priority that is being pushed but rather something that remains \"in process\".  As I understand it, there are more than 1,000 young people aged less than 65 years in residential and nursing homes.  I strongly relate that fact back to the lack of supports for people in the community and the shaving away year after year of after-supports in the community.  Those are my comments.  There is a huge amount of ground to be made up to get beyond having processes and strategies and to making things happen for people.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the issue of personal assistants in a moment, because it relates to another question.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, made some comments on it.<\/p> <p>  My second question related to foetal anticonvulsant syndrome, FACS Forum Ireland and the drug - I will mispronounce it - valproate.  Will the Minister and those from the HSE outline what has been done to enhance diagnostic process and standard operating procedures within the HSE?  What has been done to improve patient safety warnings and adequate implementation of the European Medicines Agency's ruling of 2014?  I want to be sensitive and measured when speaking on this issue.  Parents invest all of their emotion and love in their children.  There is no big deal about that - it is a fact - but they probably do not realise how much emotion and love they have until they have to deal with difficult issues and this is one of them.  We have already mentioned some other issues this afternoon.  A helpful response was provided, but for me it is still short on issues such as good governance and practice.  I am not convinced that we have got to that point.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful at this stage if the Minister were to have a short meeting with representatives of FACS Forum Ireland to get the ball rolling and to energise those in the Department of Health and the HSE to work with them.  I see the Minister's intent but I am not convinced.  As a public representative, this is about being assured that good systems are in place.  I am making a reference.  One of the quite a number of conditions that can be caused as a result of prescribing this to women with epilepsy is neural tube defects.  It is just a coincidence that it has already been mentioned.  In the first paragraph, the response acknowledges strongly what is required.  It goes on to state that the HSE is aware of the issues but, when we get onto the bullet points and particularly towards the final part on monitoring the effectiveness of the communications and follow up, the language used includes \"could be urged\", \"could be repeated\" \"[c]onsideration of [an] opportunity to conduct\" and \"[s]uch collaboration could\".  Perhaps it is the way it is written but I am not getting a sense of urgency.<\/p><p>Thanks to our health services, children born today have 60, 70, 80, 90 or maybe 100 years of life ahead of them.  For these children and others that could be 80 or 100 years of disability life years.  It is 60 for their parents, give or take.  It is not like us codgers here who may have three, four or five years on average at the end of our lifespan.  This is a big ticket item for many people.<\/p><p> The European Facts Forum estimates that over a 30-year period there could be 270 to 360 children with developmental problems caused by Valproate.  There are 100 children with malformations at birth such as neural-tube defects and cleft palate.  The director of clinical genetics in Our Lady's Hospital, Professor Andrew Green, has a database indicating that there are currently 43 children with this diagnosis.  It would be helpful to have a short meeting with this group.  There are obviously parents involved in it, but there are a number of organisations that can help practically to start moving on the message and toolkits.<\/p><p> I now want to move on to the question of personal assistants.  Before the last quarterly review, I said that personal assistants' hours are particularly crucial in enabling those with disabilities to live independent lives.  However, no explicit reference was made to personal assistants in the statement of strategy.  There were strong commitments made to independent living, however, which I am pleased to hear about.  The answer has laid out a number of things that aid independent living.  <\/p><p> This brings me to some helpful information I have been given.  There is a division between personal assistants' hours and home supports.  I am pleased to see that because when I was a member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, 15 years ago, we got reports that bundled everything.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has told us that there are 1.4 million personal assistants' hours this year for about 2,400 people.  His target last year was to provide 1.3 million, yet his activity was 200,000 more than that, so let us be clear.  Forgive my percentages, but there is probably 6% or 7% less provision of personal assistants' hours this year than was the outcome last year.  That is on the basis that the target was 1.3 million, while the activity level was 1.5 million.<\/p><p> We find different numbers, but basically the same outcome, when one looks at home support hours.  That tells me that there will be fewer personal assistants' hours provided this year than last year.  Can someone please tell me what has changed to dampen the need for that service?  For 2,400 people that works out at fewer than 600 hours per person per week, which is two hours per day.  There is an extremely strong rationing of that service.  We know that there is a significant unmet need.<\/p><p> I knew a lady for many years who passed away two years ago, and she had about 70 hours per week.  They were not sliced and diced among seven or eight other people.  I am not saying they did not need them but that is not the spirit of personal assistance.  We will have problems until we get moving on that.<\/p><p> I had a straightforward question about funding for the mental health aspects of A Vision for Change.  It has come to the end of its tenth year and has been a difficult period.  There is probably more pressure around mental health now.  It is also a co-morbidity issue for people with other conditions.  They are serious matters and I am unhappy with the reassurances that have been given.<\/p><p> Others have referred to the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I know that while the Minister of State is keen to progress the legislation, it is frustrating that events have overtaken us in recent weeks.  The Minister of State said that to move it quickly to Committee Stage a lot of the process will depend on the committee.  I am concerned that the Bill, as published, has dropped the word \"equality\" from its Title.  I will not get too upset about that, other than to say that on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State said he would deal with a number of issues on Committee Stage.  His D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Broughan, said that in his 25 years in the Oireachtas he had rarely, if ever, seen a Bill introduced by Government where a Minister stood up on Second Stage and said: \"By the way, we're going to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.\"  There are a number of serious matters that nobody has had sight of and which will come in on Committee State.  Beyond labouring the point too much - and I say this with absolute respect - for people with disabilities it has gone beyond another timeline commitment.<\/p><p> The State promised to sign the international convention and ratify it.  Ratification is a solemn international promise that the Government will get on its bike and get on with the work.  I met my European colleagues at the weekend and know that we are well ahead of quite a number of European and other countries.  If there is honesty to the Irish approach, the Government should say it will put a decent, cross-departmental package in place for the next budget.  There are a lot of issues involved, including employment, health and social protection.  That would give people confidence that it is not a stalling tactic, although I am not suggesting it is.  People do not have that confidence now.  That would put Ireland back on the front foot and start things moving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#U00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I will be concise in my contributions because I understand that important parliamentary party meetings are happening in half an hour.

Things have moved on concerning scoliosis and I welcome that.  I understand that the St. Senan's Hospital campus in Enniscorthy has been taken off the market and may be used as a third-level campus. <\/p> <p>  I want to refer briefly to the Alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency situation.  As the committee knows, some 350 people suffer from that terrible disease.  People literally cannot catch their breath and are suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD.  We all need to redouble our efforts and have a moral responsibility to resolve this matter.  The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug Respreeza, as has the European Medicines Agency.  It is already available in Italy, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, the Netherlands and Spain.  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to comment briefly on the GP contract.  I want to clarify that before becoming a Senator I was secretary of the National Association of General Practitioners.  I feel strongly that in order to have a successful outcome to this matter we need equal status.  I often use this comparison - would we have had a successful Good Friday Agreement if all the stakeholders, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP and the DUP, had not been around the table?  I think the answer is \"No\".<\/p><p>While I respect what the Minister is saying about the formal consultative process, can he see a way to ensure that if the NAGP engages in it, equal status might be achieved as the process proceeds and before it concludes?  For it to be successful, all GPs must be on a level footing.  As the Chairman said, it is about patient care at the end of the day.  Let us be clear that if the NAGP is not granted equal status, the medical profession will see it as a cosy cartel between the IMO and the Department.  That would lead to bad feeling and perhaps the failure of the talks.  I do not want that to happen.  I want a good contract to come out of this.  It is a contract that will be in place for many years and it is important that we have equal status and equal negotiating rights for all organisations involved.<\/p><p> Next, I turn briefly to the Orkambi situation.

They are being woefully underfunded now.<\/p> <p>  We have had the European health consumer index and some people place different weight on the data that comes out of that.  One of the countries which has successfully managed waiting list times is Macedonia.  The Minister is probably aware of this.  Macedonia has reduced waiting times to approximately six months with a simple online live system.  GPs can go online in the consultation with the patient sitting there and access consultants' diaries, see what physicians have vacancies and refer appropriately.  That system can also be used for diagnostic scans.

I have two items to bring up, one of which is specific to Limerick and one of which is general.  My question on Limerick refers to the new state-of-the-art accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick and is directed to Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Woods of the HSE and to the Minister.  A commitment was given that the new accident and emergency department would be opened this coming March and that was deferred to May.  We have seen in the most recent national service plan that there is talk of it now being October.  I have spoken to the HSE and the Minister about this.  It is critical that we stick to the May timeline.  Recruitment is under way and the unit is due to be completed and fitted out over the next month.<\/p> <p>  The people of Limerick have waited a long time for this.  It occurs against the backdrop of a reconfiguration which took place in 2009 when Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's accident and emergency departments were closed over a period with a commitment to establish a new department.  Included in the reconfiguration plan - and this is where I want to compliment the HSE - was a proposal to collocate a 138-bed hospital at the University Hospital Limerick site.  That did not come to pass.<\/p> <p>  In the last month, however, the acute hospital unit and, more particularly, Mr. Woods have approved the design phase for a 96-bed acute unit at the University Hospital Limerick site, adjacent to the new accident and emergency unit.

With regard to A Vision for Change, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is taking care of that.  A successor document will be developed which will complete the process of modernising mental health services and effectively promoting mental health.  It is envisaged that this successor policy will include detailed implementation arrangements - implementation being very important - underpinned by a multi-annual investment plan which will inform the allocation of resources in future years.  The Department has now awarded the contract for the review of A Vision for Change and an analysis of international evidence and best practice in the development of mental health services, including a review of the current delivery of services in this country.  This review will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision and a successor to A Vision for Change.  The review will also have regard to both human rights and health and well-being objectives.  An oversight committee will be established within three months of completion of the review to oversee the development of a new policy based on the outcome of the expert review.<\/p> <p>  The rest of the issues are matters for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, with the exception of the very important matter of the GP contract.  Let me try to be constructive in this regard.  I want to bring all parties with us, but the people I and GPs are most concerned about are the people I work for, the patients.  We need a new GP contract.  The GPs need one, as do I, the Department and the HSE.  Primary care needs it too, because we cannot get to that without it.  To clarify, I have no intention of this process resulting in a static document at the end which becomes the GP contract for another 30 years when we will return to look at it again.  I see this as an evolving process.  The engagement on the contract is under way under the framework agreement that is in place with the IMO.  It is not an agreement I put in place but an agreement that has been in place between the Department and a long-established trade union, which has been accustomed over many years to that role.  In addition, let us do something that has never been done previously by any of my predecessors, which is engage with the NAGP in a formal consultative role, and let that process work its way through.<\/p> <p>  I have met the NAGP and I will meet it again.  I think very highly of many people in the NAGP and of their constructive approach to these issues.  However, at this stage my message must be let us get on with it.  I do not believe any one or two organisations should be able to have a veto or stay on the process.  I have tried to put in place a process that is more inclusive than any other.  I want a contract that has the acceptance of both organisations.  We must get on with it.  I appeal to both organisations to play a constructive role in the various processes they have available to them.  I expect to have further engagement with the NAGP on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#X00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":661,"content":"<p>The framework document appears to be the inhibiting factor in allowing both groups to be viewed with equal status.

Long before my arrival, the Department of Health had a long-established history of negotiating with the trade union.  Senator Swanick referred to the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I hope we do not need a peace process for GP organisations here.  Some GPs have decided to set up another organisation.  It is a fine organisation with fine members.  Many of them whom I know and have met wish to play a constructive role.  I would like to have one GP organisation in order that we could get on with it, but that is not the situation.  I am doing my best to try to create a hybrid model that enables both organisations to have a voice in the process.  I ask both organisations to recognise that this has not been the position previously.  It was not the position regarding free GP care for children under six years of age and it was not the position on the roll-out of the vaccination programme to new babies.  This is a new role for the NAGP.  Senator Swanick asked about future engagement, future roles and it not being a static document.  Let us see where the process brings us.  Let us try to get results from this process and see if that can be built on into the future.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the national maternity strategy, masterships and so forth, I had a good meeting with Professor Kenny and her colleagues in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, which I mentioned earlier.  They have strong views on the importance of clinical autonomy, ring-fenced budgets and so forth.  I have asked Professor John Higgins of the South-South West hospital group, and Mr. Kilian McGrane, the new director of the national women and infants health programme, to report back to me on the range of issues that were brought up at that meeting.  The national maternity strategy refers to such structures, including masterships, as evolving over time and says that no single model fits all, but legitimate issues are being highlighted by Professor Kenny and her colleagues.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to governance.  It is fair to say that we must bring a degree of certainty to the governance structures relating to the HSE, the Department and the Minister.  It is not fair on any of that triumvirate so far.  We had a situation where the HSE had a board.  That board was abolished with a view to the HSE being abolished.  The HSE is still functioning but there is no board.  I hope that the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will put this issue to rest once and for all.  People working extraordinarily hard in our health service day and night have a right to certainty about their future structure and how they will continue to make a contribution to the positive development of the health service.  If the Committee on the Future of Healthcare reports in April, which is the deadline, then by the summer we will begin to have a sense of the direction of travel in terms of answering the important question the Chairman raised regarding governance, accountability, roles and responsibilities.  We would all serve the development of our health service well if we could answer that question by the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#X00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":663,"content":"<p>First, I accept the point about public duty across all the Departments.  I strongly stress that we all have a public and civic duty in respect of disabilities.  All Departments have to take responsibility in that regard.  I have been monitoring the Departments over the past seven or eight months and some of them have an excellent track record in including people with disabilities and also in progressing them.  For example, the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health have an excellent record in terms of their vision and strategy.  They are listening to people with disabilities.  I consider them examples of good practice.  To take a simple example involving the arts and the disabilities sectors, there is a huge movement in the disability sector towards involvement with the arts.  The funding from the State is not coming from the Department of Health but through the Arts Council.  There is much radical change taking place and many examples of good practice.  The same is happening with employment too.  Some Departments have an excellent record.  All Departments have a target of 3%, but I am asking them to try to get it up to 6%.  Already, some Departments and sections of public services are up to 3.6% and 3.7% in terms of employing people with disabilities.  These developments are happening.<\/p> <p>  The housing issue mentioned by Senator Dolan is very important and we must deal with it.  I have made many detailed representations to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  I have visited many community housing projects, and I intend to develop that.  The Senator is right that we need more social and affordable housing for people with disabilities and we must ensure they are included in the housing plans.  My objective is to ensure that happens.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about personal assistants, I accept there was some confusion around the time of the budget and the launch of the services.  However, we should consider what happened in 2016.  In the national service plan for 2016 the HSE priority was to provide 1.3 million hours of personal assistant services.  However, it exceeded expected activity level for personal assistant hours by approximately 200,000 hours.  In 2017, the HSE expects to deliver 1.4 million personal assistant hours, which is an increase of 100,000 hours on the 2016 target, to 2,357 adults with a physical or sensory disability.  In the HSE's national service plan for 2016 the priority was to provide 2.6 million hours to more than 7,300 people with disabilities.  The actual number of home supports provided in 2016 is very important.  In the national service plan for 2017, the executive expects to deliver 2.75 million home support hours to more than 7,400 people with disability.  This is an increase of 150,000 hours over last year's target.  This reflects the responsive nature of personal home assistant support services.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the actions taken by the Department of Health to support independent living, I am working closely with the Department on this.<\/p><p>We have set up the task force on personalised budgets.  This will give people with disabilities more control over the budgets and, I hope, more personal assistance hours as well.  I know this will not affect all members of the disability community but it will affect between 8% and 11% of them.<\/p><p> Senator Dolan made a point about shaving.  I am keen to point out strongly that there will be no shaving of disability services.  The idea is to invest and reform.  That is my plan for the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017022200002#X00600","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487770200,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I have no wish to delay people.  The Minister of State has just read out two of the paragraphs that came to me in the answer to my question.  The target of 1.3 million hours in 2016 was exceeded by 200,000.  Unless my arithmetic is way off, the figure comes to 1.5 million hours.  The Minister of State has confirmed that 1.4 million hours are available this year.  That is 100,000 more than budgeted for last year but 100,000 less than the activity from last year.  In itself, that is shaving.  That is approximately the same amount of shaving as the overall increase in the disability budget the Minister of State adverted to for this year.  Anyone can look at the figures.  Unless my arithmetic is wrong, it means that 6%, 7% or 8% is gone off the activity level from last year.  The target at the beginning of the year was 1.3 million hours but it turned out to be 1.5 million.  This year, the service is planning to provide 1.4 million hours, which is 100,000 hours less than the provision for last year.  It is ironic that this is happening to a service that is so central to people.  The same is happening with home supports; at least the percentages are the same in the drop.<\/p> <p>  My point is proved by the answers I have received.  There continues to be shaving of important community services for people with disabilities.  Is it any wonder that young people with disabilities - these are people under 65 years of age - are going in to nursing homes and being subject to signing up to the fair deal scheme?  This is going on.

To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions I am joined by Tim Gaston, director of public transport services with the authority.  Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority in this provision of public transport services.<\/p> <p>  The remit of the National Transport Authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services, namely, bus, rail, light rail and taxi, by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  This includes the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.  The authority is responsible for securing the provision of public bus services through two specified mechanisms: public service contracts, where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis; and the licensing of public bus services, which are operated on a commercial basis.  In licensing commercial bus services, it is important to note that the relevant legislation, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, requires the authority to seek to achieve, in the public interest, regulated competition in the provision of such services.<\/p> <p>  I would like to now deal with the specific areas of focus raised by the committee, that is the financial position of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Bus &Eacute;ireann finds itself in a very difficult position financially, caused by losses related to its commercial Expressway business.  It should be noted that the NTA has fully remunerated Bus &Eacute;ireann for the services that it operates under the direct award contract with the authority since December 2009.  The NTA rejects the suggestions that the granting of commercial licences to bus operators has been solely to blame for the difficulties being experienced by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The notions that there is saturation on the intercity corridors served by Expressway services and that the NTA grants licences to operators at the drop of a hat also do not stand up to scrutiny.  In fact, since 2011 we have rejected almost as many applications for licences on these key routes as we have granted.<\/p> <p>  Our primary responsibility in law is to the travelling public and when we assess an application for a commercial licence we do so with the public in mind.  It has consistently been the case that where new licences are issued in these markets, overall passenger numbers have increased, in many cases very significantly.  For example, between 2012 and 2015 total bus passenger numbers on the Cork-Dublin corridor increased by 61%, while on the Limerick-Dublin corridor they increased by 50%.  In other words, rather than saturating the market, what we have actually done is increase public transport capacity, and in so doing enabled many more journeys to be undertaken on the bus network.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann commercial services like Expressway account for only 19% of all the company&rsquo;s passengers.  Some 81% of Bus &Eacute;ireann passengers are on routes subsidised under the public service obligation, PSO, contract that the company has entered into with the NTA.  This will not change and these services are under no threat.  In fact, they have been a huge success story in recent years, with passenger numbers continuing to increase.  Last month the NTA published passenger figures for 2016, which indicated a 5.5% increase in passengers on Bus &Eacute;ireann subsidised services, jumping from 30.2 million in 2015 to 32 million last year.  Subvention for these services by the NTA to Bus &Eacute;ireann increased from &euro;34 million in 2014 to &euro;40 million in 2016 and that figure is likely to go up again in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The objective of the rural transport programme, local link, is to provide a good quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  In 2016, funding of &euro;11.9 million was provided through the authority for the programme with an additional &euro;1.5 million provided by the Department of Social Protection under the free travel scheme.  Since assuming responsibility for the programme in 2012, we have focused on restructuring the programme to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness in the service delivery.  The restructuring programme included the establishment of 17 local link offices, which replaced the 35 rural transport groups previously managing the programme.  Local passenger services are managed by the relevant local link office in each area on behalf of the authority.  This restructuring has positioned the programme to better integrate with other public transport services, and provides a solid base to expand or adapt services to meet current and future identified needs.  Now that the organisational restructuring has been completed, we are focused on optimising the services provided within the funding envelope available.  A review of services is currently in progress to ensure that they are meeting the needs of local families in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  It is very evident that there are gaps in the provision of rural transport services across the State.  Local link offices are working closely with local authorities and local communities on the assessment of local transport needs, including the needs of those who are socially excluded.  Local link offices are the NTA's eyes and ears in rural Ireland, and working together I believe we can make real progress in improving local public transport services.  Twenty-one new regular commuter bus services were secured in the network in 2016.  Regular five, six and seven-day-per-week bus services have been introduced following considerable development work by the authority and the relevant offices in Cavan-Monaghan, Meath, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon.<\/p> <p>  In 2017 the authority will continue to identify improvements in existing services and to develop appropriate new routes based on the budget of &euro;15.9 million, including the &euro;1.5 million from the Department of Social Protection.  Over 40 new additional rural transport services are currently being examined by the authority to be delivered across the State this year.  Key features of the developments include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The authority is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its contracted services and is now looking at expansion of those services, with the budget for public service obligations having increased since 2016.  Kerry and Mayo are two of the counties that have seen service improvements.  The authority also promoted the improvements in the regional cities which have seen phenomenal growth in passenger numbers.  Improved town services have also been delivered in Athlone following the success of the Sligo bus services enhancements.<\/p> <p>  If some Expressway services are discontinued at local level the NTA will, as our track record proves, step in and ensure that local demands for public transport are met.  When Expressway route 5 was terminated and Expressway route 7 was curtailed in 2015, the authority put a number of services in place by extending some existing Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO services and by tendering new PSO services and new local link services.  If there are any changes to Expressway services, we will carry out a similar assessment and not leave any rural communities behind.<\/p> <p>  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Tim Duggan to speak on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#D00300","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today on the matter of the Department of Social Protection's free travel scheme.  Unfortunately, due to other commitments the Minister for Social Protection is not available to attend today and he sends his apologies.  My colleagues, Miriam Finnegan, Darragh Doherty and Peter O&rsquo;Reilly work on the policy and operational sides of the free travel scheme.<\/p> <p>  The free travel scheme was established in 1967 and permits travel for free on most CIE public transport services, Luas and up to 80 private operators.  Free travel is also available on cross-Border journeys and within Northern Ireland.  It is available to people aged over 66 years, to carers and to people in receipt of disability allowance, blind pension and invalidity pension.  There are currently just under 875,000 customers directly eligible for free travel and when companion and spousal passes are taken into account this brings the total potential eligibility up to over 1.4 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, it is estimated that payment of &euro;61 million will be made to the CIE group.  The apportionment of payment among the three constituent companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus Atha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is a matter for the CIE group to determine and the Department has no role in that.  In addition, it is estimated that payments will be made under the scheme of &euro;8.5 million to private operators, &euro;3.9 million to Luas, &euro;1.5 million to the rural transport programme and &euro;1.7 million for cross-Border travel, which is paid to Translink and a private operator.<\/p><p>In 2012 the then Ministers for Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport established an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme.  The review was carried out at a time of fiscal constraint to examine and report on the operation, sustainability, effectiveness and future development of the free travel scheme.  By the time the report was finalised in October 2014, the economic position had improved significantly and the report and its recommendations were not considered by the then Ministers or the Government and it does not at this stage represent Government policy.  The Minister has made it clear on many occasions that he considers the free travel scheme to be an invaluable support for older people and people with disabilities, with a significant role to play in promoting social inclusion and preventing isolation.  He has highlighted his full commitment to maintaining the free travel scheme and there are no plans to make changes to it at this time.<\/p><p> Funding for the free travel scheme was capped at 2010 levels under the Programme for National Recovery 2011&ndash;2014.  In budget 2016 an additional &euro;3 million was made available to allow new entrants to the scheme or to ensure services were maintained where there had been changes to routes.  CIE submitted a request to the Department in September 2016 for increased funding.  The Department ensured this submission was included in the budgetary considerations at the time, but given the many competing demands for funding in budget 2017, the Government was unable to increase funding for the scheme.<\/p><p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has written to the Minister for Social Protection asking that consideration be given to reviewing the funding arrangements and level which was last set in 2010 and proposed that the Departments engage further on the matter.  This engagement is under way and further meetings are planned between the Departments and the National Transport Authority to review the payment mechanisms underpinning the free travel scheme.  The final decisions onthe funding of the scheme will be a matter for the Government.  <\/p><p> I am happy to discuss any issue the committee would like to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I welcome both delegations.

Is that not what we have said all along?  Is that not what we said was the difference between private operators and a public transport network?  If we continue on the path we are on of axing public transport routes, we are leaving them at the behest of private operators who can withdraw their licence a week later if they wish.  That is very significant because it adds to the argument of public transport being there as a public service to provide transport on routes that are not commercially viable.<\/p> <p>  Would the NTA accept that the over-staturation of routes has contributed significantly to the financial crisis?  It would be foolish not to but the NTA has been reluctant so far to accept that or to admit to it publicly.  On the review of all the licences to private operators, would the NTA publish that review or could the committee have sight of it?  It seems strange that, particularly on the loss-making routes, with all the goings on over the last three or four months, the NTA has not been forthright in pointing to this detailed review on all routes so we can have the details to scrutinise them.  We could then determine whether the over-saturation is linked to the loss-making and so on.  I wonder if we could get a commitment on that.  <\/p> <p>  The NTA is the Government policy implementer and in implementing policy I am sure it would recognise that it has contributed to this financial crisis.  Given the calls by the unions over the past three or four months to have all stakeholders around the table for negotiations, why has the NTA been so unwilling thus far to engage, especially in view of the fact that it is the implementer of the Government policy?  It has been part of the problem in creating the crisis and I do not understand its reluctance thus far to helping to find a resolution.  <\/p> <p>  On the free travel pass, can the NTA confirm if there is a different subsidy given to private operators than to the public transport network?  On the travel pass not being accepted on certain routes by certain private operators, would that not be something the NTA would have checked before granting a licence?  Why grant a licence to a private operator which was unwilling to use the facility of the free travel pass?  Does the NTA know the percentage of private operators who are not taking the free travel pass?<\/p> <p>  On route closures, can the NTA confirm how many routes it plans to close completely or how many are earmarked?  The reason I am raising this issue is the Dublin to Derry route, I think it is called the X3.  It is part of Government's National Framework Policy to integrate connectivity between Dublin and the north west and it seems that if the NTA goes ahead with closing the Dublin to Derry route it would be going against Government policy in this area.  I am seeking the rationale behind that and all the other routes that it has identified.  The NTA has not said what routes are involved and it would be helpful if it said which routes it had targeted and that it planned to axe in view of the adverse effect it will have on people across the community.  <\/p> <p>  I find it confusing that the NTA has said several times that while it plans to cut back on Bus &Eacute;ireann services it will not leave any rural community behind.  What is the plan there?  It will not leave any rural community behind.  Will there be a service that is free of charge?  How is it going to provide a service or give a commitment to not leave rural Ireland behind if there is going to be a cost?  If there is already a service available why is the NTA removing a service to replace it with another service that is going to cost possibly even more money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#H00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":795,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked me to address a number of issues.  I indicated that a private operator which has a licence service is not obliged to continue that service if it is unviable on a commercial basis.  It could be for other reasons that it would want to withdraw from the service.  This is covered by the legislation under which we operate on behalf of the Government.  There is no doubt that there is more protection for services that are subject to a PSO contract and any changes in regard to those services needs our approval.  The only time we would want to consider that would be if we were not in a position to fund services.  We try to protect as many public transport services as we can because it is in our interest to make sure there are as many people as possible using public transport, but we do not have the same level of control over a licence service as we do over a subsidised service.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept that there is over-saturation on the intercity routes.

The function of the NTA is to ensure that a proper transport service is provided throughout the country.  Today we are talking about rural bus services and Expressway.  The NTA assesses licences for routes where there is competition.  There has been some discussion on the matter already in terms of an uptake in usage.  In the context of the Cork to Dublin route, for example, the NTA said there was a 61% increase in usage, but it is a known fact that capacity has been increased by 111%.  How can one call that fair competition when the private operator can go directly from Cork to Dublin without stopping but Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway route must stop at certain towns.  The EU Competition Commissioner is due to come before us.  Recently, I noted an Expressway bus pulling into Mitchelstown with 45 people on board but only two paid fares.  How can one expect a company to compete with a private operator, especially when the private operators are reluctant to take all the people with free travel passes?<\/p> <p>  Is this a way for the Minister for Social Protection to, in the future, charge people who are currently entitled to free travel?  The NTA has said it would step in and provide a rural link service.  The people who use the service end up paying in one way or another for it.  It is all well and good to say an alternative service will be provided.  The Minister has said he will not abolish free travel for old age pensioners but will charging come in the back door via the rural link buses when they are put in place?  Could Ms Graham please comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#M00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":881,"content":"<p>The free travel pass is accepted on all local link services.

There was 61% passenger growth in a short period of years and during a downturn.  As a result, we believe the routes are very successful and we are particularly pleased that there has been no impact on rail services.  We also believe that the additional licences have grown the public transport market and resulted in fewer people using cars to travel, for example, to travel from Dublin to Cork.<\/p> <p>  In terms of decisions that are made, it is the operators that decide what they want to deliver on the motorway network.  The private operators that came forward with the Expressway services made the decision to go into that market and we accepted in half the cases that there was demand for those services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann could have looked at any stage to provide those kinds of services as well but chose not to do so in many cases.

Bus &Eacute;ireann could also make those decisions, as it potentially will do now, with regard to withdrawing from some of its services and potentially withdrawing some of the stopping places also on some of its services.  That is the competitive market in which we operate in the provision of public transport and how the market is legislated for.  Beyond that, where there are gaps in the services, the NTA looks to see whether the public service obligation is required and we attempt to ensure that this gap is filled by a contracted service.  This is the model that is legislated for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I have one more question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Be very brief because there are other speakers waiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00500","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Duggan have information on the number of people who had free bus travel bus passes in 2010 and the number now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00600","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":921,"content":"<p>The number now is just under 875,000 people and the number in 2010 was just under 700,000 people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>How much extra funding was given to cover the numbers of people travelling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00800","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":923,"content":"<p>We have covered this already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O00900","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":924,"content":"<p>My last question is on records.

I live in Mayo, in a rural part of the west of Ireland, and this topic is hugely important to me.  Following on from Deputy Fitzmaurice's contribution, it is extremely worrying and it begs the question as to who is in control of providing public transport services to rural Ireland.  It would seem that the operators make the decisions.  For those of us who live in rural Ireland that is a crazy situation.  It derives from being a political decision.  In 2015 the Taoiseach responded to the serious issue of cutting routes by saying that buses cannot be driving around boreens.  With a Government response such as that it is no wonder we are in this situation.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;9.4 million in losses, and in context of what is happening economically and financially in the State, if the Government had not allowed the section 110 tax breaks for the vulture funds we could be running the transport service and Bus &Eacute;ireann as it has been run for 37 years, without making any cuts to staff or to routes.  These are the political choices being made and they need to be examined in the wider context.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly interested in and worried about the Athlone to Westport service and I want to ask the witnesses a couple of key questions on it.  This was first mooted in 2015.  Since then, in the marketing and the shoring up of that route, it has been said that savings of  &euro;1.1 million would be made by cutting the Athlone-Westport, Dublin-Clonmel and Dublin-Derry routes.  Perhaps the NTA could give a breakdown of the savings on each of these routes and over what length of time they may be accrued.  Could the witnesses also indicate if they have calculated how many extra passengers it would take to make those routes viable to make up the savings of the &euro;1.1 million?  What consultation processes took place in the time before the decision was made?  When the NTA made the decision, did it take into account the Wild Atlantic Way and the millions of euro being used to market this internationally to bring people to the west of Ireland?  Has the decision been made or is it just on the table?  Is more consultation to take place?  There is quite a lot there but I had to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#O01300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487754000,"counter":928,"content":"<p>We have not made the decision.

One of the most extraordinary NTA decisions is the fact that per kilometre for PSO services in rural areas is way higher than per kilometre for urban-based services.  Those fares, at &euro;20 return, are a huge disincentive when it could be &euro;10 return to go the same distance for those lucky enough to live in an urban area.<\/p><p>We have very few services after 6 p.m., even out of the third level towns, the towns with hospitals and so on.  The rural service is being run <i>&agrave; la<\/i>the 1950s and not the 21st century, and it does not meet needs.  It goes back to the question of paying &euro;4 per head more for the urban bus public transport than the rural one.  We do not have any clear commuter policy for those who need to commute 30 or 40 miles into the major urban centres of Cork, Galway, Carlow and so on.<\/p><p>That seems to be mind-boggling.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute is a symptom of a much deeper disease, which is the idea that the people are down the country and any kind of a Mickey Mouse service will do because the place we need really good services is urban areas.  I do not buy that.  Having grown up in Dublin city and gone to live in the west, I expect my tax euro to be treated equally with everybody else.  The rest of the people in rural Ireland are fed up of the two-tier society where our tax euro subsidising services in urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017022200002#Q03000","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487754000,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the committee so I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak.  This is something in which I have taken a particular interest.  I am based in Limerick city and I will deal with a microcosm that reflects the issue, particularly the Bus &Eacute;ireann routes.  There are numerous operators on the Limerick to Dublin route, with one being Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I will deal with one private operator as well.  Annacotty is close to where I live and I know both services stop there.  One of the private operators has only two stops on the way up, with one at the Kildare outlet centre and the other at the Red Cow roundabout before going to Bachelors Walk.  It costs &euro;10.  Bus &Eacute;ireann stops in Annacotty and does not stop at Kildare but it stops in Nenagh, Roscrea, twice in Portlaoise and then it effectively goes to the Red Cow as well.  It charges &euro;7.99 online.  One route appears to be very profitable and the other is not but they are both doing the same and more or less at the same price.<\/p><p>One must consider the sense of equity.  This question is directed at Ms Graham and Mr. Duggan.  There appears to be a lack of empirical evidence on the number of people using the free travel pass on the Bus &Eacute;ireann routes, whether they are pensioners, people other than pensioners and companions.  There are no free travel passes used on the private operator service and everybody pays the &euro;10.  In this day and age, the fact that such information is not available is a scandal.  It informs a decision regarding the public service obligation, PSO, and fairness <i>vis-a-vis<\/i>the service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators.  It is almost impossible to evaluate it as a result.<\/p><p>Does Ms Graham believe the current PSO model is outdated?  She referred to current legislation.

If I live in those areas, the service to my town would be provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann but it is not provided by a private operator.  Why is a PSO from the main motorway to Nenagh, Roscrea and Portlaoise not being considered?  What reasons would prevent that?  Is there a need for a change in legislation in order that we can compare like with like?  Where is the information on the number of free travel passes being used on all routes?

That is entirely within the gift of the Department of Social Protection to determine.  It is not something that public transport wants to get into.
