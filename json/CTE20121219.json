The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will have primary responsibility for implementation of the measures contained in the regulation if and when it is approved.<\/p><p>  The European Commission's recently published proposal for a regulation on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived was published on 24 October and presented to the European Council's social questions working group by the Commission on 23 November.  The proposal is based on the previous EU experience of this type of programme.  It has a tradition dating back to 1987 of releasing intervention stocks of food to the poorest people in member states.  This was, for the most part, distributed by agriculture Departments using networks of NGOs and organisations involved in the relief of the poor.  With changes in how the Common Agricultural Policy operates, the levels of intervention food stocks have become unpredictable or non-existent.  However, the Commission is very keen to continue its support for people at the margins of society and thus, this proposal has emerged.  The key objective of the regulation is to contribute to the Europe 2020 poverty target of having 20 million fewer people in poverty.  The proposal calls for a fund of &euro;2.5 billion over seven years for the 28 member states to help to address this difficult social problem.  The proposal is being made under Article 175.3 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union relating to promoting social cohesion.  The specific objective is to alleviate the worst forms of poverty by providing non-financial assistance in the form of food and other goods.<\/p><p>  As the regulation is drafted, there is scope allowing member states to provide a number of forms of support and the Commission has indicated that it would like a flexible approach to be adopted to enable member states to implement their own arrangements to deliver the funding.  It is leaving it up to member states to decide whether to target directly or indirectly and how to define the target group.  The fund will be implemented by shared management and the regulation tries to keep implementation as simple and as flexible as possible.  It is envisaged that most member states will rely on existing channels for such support and use a combination of public and voluntary bodies to distribute the aid.  <\/p><p>  In terms of financing, the overall budget is not significant in EU or national terms.  However, depending on how the fund is eventually distributed and how narrowly focused the measures in an operational programme might be, the impact could be significant.  Member states will also be required to co-finance the operational programme up to a possible 15%, with special criteria applying to programme countries.  As for the likely sum of money Ireland may receive, I have no information on that matter yet.  However, we believe the amount will be small, but it could make a significant contribution if used narrowly.  The Commission proposes using allocation criteria based on two indicators, namely, the number of people in severe material deprivation and the number in households with low work intensity and how this has changed in past three years.<br \/><b><\/b>I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to outline the proposal which is at an early stage of development.  I ask the committee to note that in our role as President we will not be in a position to take a national position; instead we will be taking a neutral stance on the merits of the proposal but with the objective of ensuring successful negotiations deliver an outcome at the earliest opportunity.  While we are aware some member states do have reservations about certain aspects, this is not unusual at this point.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of subsidiarity, the Department has formed a view that such matters do not arise in that the proposed regulation will replace existing arrangements with similar objectives, albeit with different methods of implementation.  The proposal is consistent with existing policies of the European Union, particularly cohesion policy and the aims of the European Social Fund.  Member states are not under an obligation to implement the actions called for under the proposal.  However, the funding cannot be used for other purposes if not drawn down.  The amount of funding is small in terms of the overall funding available under the European Social Fund.  We are only at the preliminary stage of discussion of this proposal, on which we are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  <\/p><p>  I thank members for their attention and will be pleased to answer whatever questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1355922000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn for her presentation.  Why has this proposal been placed before us at such short notice?  For example, if we were to avail of the option of seeking a reasoned opinion, we would have to deal with the matter tomorrow in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, which would place a strain on us.  Even though, in terms of the scale of the problem of poverty throughout Europe, only a small pot of money is involved, it is important that we fully consider what is being proposed.<\/p><p>  I recall the intervention stocks and butter vouchers provided in the 1980s.  I recall also the mantra of the European Union at the time that one should not interfere with the market.  However, the reason there were intervention stocks was there had been interference in the market.  In this case, the position is different.  In some ways, the European Social Fund is laudable.  As we all pay into it, we would only be getting back a little of what we put in.  I do not know whether what Ireland would receive would equate to what it has contributed to the fund in recent years.   <\/p><p>  This proposal is from the European Commission, the same body which is part of the troika which is demanding that we do the devil and all to cut social welfare rates and ensure people do in fact live in poverty.  The budgets for this year and last year were the consequence of some of its diktats.  Also, the European Central Bank is charging us high interest  rates.  According to EUROSTAT figures, there are 120 million people in Europe at risk of poverty.  If during the seven years of the programme the calculation was made <i>pro rata<\/i>, Ireland would only receive &euro;2 million per annum, which is buttons in comparison to what we are paying in interest charges to the European Central Bank.<\/p> <p>It might be more, we do not know because we do not have the figures.  It is a matter for negotiation but I cannot see the other European countries agreeing that Ireland would get a bigger share of a small pot, given that they have not been very supportive of our calls to the convention to date.<\/p><p> The most recent figures from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions, SILC, is that approximately 16% are at risk of poverty in Ireland.  That percentage figure nearly equates to the number on the live register but also people who are in low paid work, which is some 660,000.  When one divides &euro;2 million by the number of people, some 660,000, it amounts to the price of a packet of EasiSingles at &euro;2.90 each.  Even though it might seem attractive it is not attractive in view of these figures.<\/p><p> We are discussing whether there is an element of subsidiarity.  I believe this is in conflict with subsidiarity.  The EU through this decision would be determining how this money would be spent in Ireland but there is an element of compulsion in that whatever grant is given, Ireland would have to trump up at least 15%, as stated in the presentation.  Again the final part will not be known.  Not only will it not be known for a while, but Ireland will have no role because of hosting the EU Presidency and acting in a neutral position.  We will not be able to influence whether that is 15%, 5% or another figure.<\/p><p> My concern is that we do not have a say once we have rubber stamped this.  My inkling would be that we call a halt until we have a full discussion and can see the full implications of the grant.  The intervention stock benefited people on and off over time and this money might benefit people who are at risk of poverty, homeless people and people in absolute distress, but it is so small that it will not make a major change in their life.  We need to look at this in a different way.  I hope Ms Quinn will be able to answer some of the questions.  <\/p><p> If we go ahead with this, the likelihood is that this will form the basis of future EU interventions in national states in terms of the European Social Fund.  I do not think the intention was for the European Social Fund to be set in this way.  I think the original concept was that it would grant aid or give Government specific moneys for specific projects but the Government was not tied to deliver in the way that it has now been formatted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900003#D00400","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355922600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I see where Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is coming from.  I agree to disagree with him but I hope we will get rid of the troika in 2013.  A great deal of pain has been put on the public but in Spain, which is experiencing significant difficulties, one only gets social welfare for two years.  After that a person is cut off completely, there is no social welfare.  Some 1.5 million people in Spain have no welfare payment from the state.  In Croatia one gets a social welfare payment for six months if one is lucky.  I think this should be pushed on and implemented as soon as possible.  Those in need in Spain are relying on-ex pats, British people who have opened soup kitchens to feed the people.  It is a good incentive.  The figure is &euro;2.5 billion and I think we should look at the bigger picture.  I know that Ireland is suffering but other countries are suffering as much.  We are lucky in certain cases to have a social welfare system in place because many countries would like to have our system but cannot afford it.  The situation in Spain is very serious.  They thought they could fill the vacuum by stimulating growth and they put &euro;22 billion into the economy which has gone into a black hole.  Spain might need a bailout but they are introducing austerity measures in Spain because they have no option.  They are starting to do what we have been doing for the past three years.  They have seen what Ireland has done and are starting to do something similar but unfortunately they are three years behind us.<\/p><p>  This was the subject of a recent BBC 2 documentary.

The ongoing work for the Irish Presidency has been top heavy in terms of the work programmes for Departments.

In the overarching negotiations for the EU, this programme could be smaller, depending on what happens.  It is a small amount of money, but given the way it could be used in a targeted way to focus on the homeless or people who are very detached from the labour market, it could be beneficial if it was targeted at a small number of people.<\/p><p>  I take the point made by the Deputy on our ability to influence the proposals.

There is significant evidence to support breakfast in schools on the basis that learning increases once nutrition is provided for brain development especially in the morning because it breaks the fast of the night before.  Indeed, the World Bank has supported this in other countries.  I am getting feedback to suggest that where breakfast is provided in schools many children are not eating the food.  There is disadvantage in many settings that are not classified as disadvantaged.  I would like to see this provided to all schools given the squeezed middle class, the squeezed coping classes and the fact that MABS could tell me the other day that more than one third of its clients are waged and self-employed and many are in pre-arrears.

However, subsidiarity was not protected at that stage.  The subsidiarity principles came late to the European Union dynamic and because something went through previously does not mean it should not be questioned now.  I attended a European Union event.  It is clear from the European Commission and the directors that they want to dictate how member states might use money but, on the other hand, Ireland's record is quite good when money is flexible.  In regard to the use of European Social Fund in education, it is clear that Ireland uses that funding well.  Largely, it funded the regional technical colleges at the time and it funded courses but also much infrastructure.  There is much to be said for more flexibility than what is provided for in this programme.  Basically, it provides for non-financial assistance whereas it should be possible to use it as one wishes up to a point.  In that way one could have ideas and be innovative.

While the officials will continue to argue Ireland's position it would be much better if the Irish Government was out there publicly demanding a greater proportion of this pot of money in competition with countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, which are in extreme crisis like ourselves.<\/p><p> I am disappointed this is not a bigger pot of money.  This is European Union citizens' money, which we paid into the European Union in the recent past, and this allocation is a pittance.  That is not the fault of the Department.  This proposal was only initiated in October and it seems it is progress is being rushed.  It should have been initiated when the crisis came to light two or three years ago and it would have been in place at this stage.  It will not come into effect next year but is intended to come into effect the following year.  It will not deliver &euro;2.5 billion in the morning to the poor in Spain, Portugal or those other countries of which Deputy Butler said we in the Opposition do not appear to be aware.  I have many good friends living in Spain and Portugal who have regularly explained to me and others the extreme crisis they are in.  Sometimes they hear what our Government is doing and they are also concerned about those in despair in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900005#F01800","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355923800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I certainly acknowledge the disappointment about the level of funding.

I am pleased with this opportunity to address the committee in my capacity as chairperson designate of the National Council for Special Education.  As I only became aware of this appointment about a week ago, I have only begun to put together some initial thoughts on how I will give leadership and manage this role.  Now that I am retired, I am very willing to put some of my time and expertise into some active role in Irish education at a national level.  As members of the committee will be aware, this is a non-remunerated post.<\/p><p>  I will briefly cover three main points, as follows: my experience in education, my vision for the NCSE in the years ahead, and my role as chairperson of the council.  As regards my experience in education, I was the chief inspector in the Department of Education and Science - now known as the Department of Education and Skills - from 1997 to 2009, having joined the inspectorate there in 1992.  Prior to my time in the Department of Education and Skills, I was the founding principal of a large co-educational post-primary school in Limerick, from 1978 to 1992.  Enrolment in that school increased from 90 students in its first year to more than 1,000 students within ten years.<\/p> <p>Between 1971 and 1978 I was a post-primary teacher of business studies subjects in a number of schools.  I was also the author of many books and articles on business and economics.  If some members are young enough, they might have studied some of them for the leaving certificate.<\/p><p> Some of my key achievements as chief inspector can be found on many pages of the History of Ireland's School Inspectorate, 1931-2008, written by Professor John Coolahan.  I have a copy for anyone who wishes to read it over Christmas.  Such initiatives included from 1978 the return of marked  leaving certificate scripts to candidates; major structural change, reform and expansion of the inspectorate; the introduction of whole school evaluation, WSE, subject inspections and incidental inspections to all schools in Ireland; and the publication of inspection reports.  I also played a lead role as chairman of the planning group in the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service in 1998, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, in 2003.  All of these happened in developing the inspectorate.<\/p><p> While I do not have a qualification and have not had direct involvement in any area of special education to date, I chaired the planning group within the then Department of Education and Science that in 2000 produced a report entitled, A National Support Service for Special Education for Students with Disabilities, which made ten recommendations.  It is now known as the Stack report.  Two of the recommendations were that the then Minister for Education and Science establish a national council for special education and that the proposed council have two key functions - a research and policy function and an operations function.  That was the starting point for the establishment of the NCSE.  <\/p><p> Since my retirement, I have done some work as a facilitator, mediator and adviser to schools and organisations.  I also make presentations at conferences and mini-conferences and conduct half-day and full day sessions with educational leaders and entire teaching staffs in schools.<\/p><p> I refer to my vision for the NCSE.  My initial thoughts are about ensuring the five strategic objectives spelled out in the recent council statement of strategy 2012-16 are delivered in the next few years.  These objectives are based on the functions set out in section 20 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.  The first relates to operational issues.  The strategic objective in this regard is to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services for children with special educational needs.  It might be described as core business.  To achieve this, the NCSE has nine senior SENOs and 73 SENOs deployed nationally who allocate supports to approximately 4,000 schools to assist them in meeting the special educational needs of children arising from a disability.<\/p><p> The second strategic objective relates to policy advice and is to provide evidence-informed policy advice for the Minister for Education and Skills on the education of children with special educational needs.  The development of NCSE policy advice is informed by evidence both from national and international research, consultation with the NCSE consultative forum and other educational stakeholders, the experience of NCSE council members and staff and visits to mainstream and special schools.<\/p><p> The third strategic objective, based on research, is to conduct and deliver a research programme to underpin the dissemination of information relating to best practice in special education to schools, parents and the education sector.   I understand a number of consistent messages have arisen in the findings across the research to date such as the need for teachers to be upskilled in educating children with special needs, for example, differentiation-pedagogical approaches, disability specific information, etc.; the importance of early identification and early intervention; long waiting lists for assessments, particularly educational assessments, resulting in a delay in accessing resources and some parents seeking a private assessment; the role of SNAs in often working outside their care role but which is considered to be valuable support for schools; and closer inter-agency interdisciplinary working, particularly between health and education providers.  I intend to read all of this research in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> Strategic objective No. 4 identifies the review of further and higher educational provision for adults with special educational needs and the development of best practice.  Under section 20 of the EPSEN Act 2004, one of the functions of the NCSE is to review and provide advice on education-training services for adults with special educational needs.  Under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, the NCSE, together with the HSE, will have certain functions regarding the assessment of needs and preparation of service statements for adults with disabilities.  Up to 2011 the focus of the NCSE was on providing supports for pupils with special educational needs rather than considering adult educational issues.  I need to examine this issue in greater detail with the new council in the next few months.<\/p><p> Strategic objective No. 5 is to ensure the NCSE continues to develop as an effective organisation which is compliant with all statutory, regulatory and corporate governance requirements, as well as having effective information dissemination, communication and media strategies in place.<\/p><p> These five strategic objectives have to be achieved in a way that ensures the NCSE mission statement and its vision statement are fulfilled in the context of the policy, legal, economic and social environments.  As chairperson, I see my role as a person who provides the necessary leadership, in accordance with the code of good governance, to ensure the council is clear about its mandate and effectively functions to provide strategic guidance while also monitoring the activities and effectiveness of the work of the NCSE to ensure the highest standards of service provision are achieved.  I will work closely with the chief executive officer, Ms Teresa Griffin, and her senior staff team.  I also intend to cultivate and rely on the co-operation, expertise and good judgement of the council members to assist me in my role.  I look forward to working with the new council after my appointment on 1 January 2013.<\/p><p> At the outset of the presentation I indicated that my thought processes had only begun to focus on this new role.  I need to read further into the role in the next few weeks and listen to what people have to say on special education issues such as committee members, senior staff in the NCSE, personnel in the Department of Education and Skills, relevant parents' associations, school management bodies, school principals, teacher associations and children.  I thank members for their attention and look forward to the challenge in the year ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900008#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355925000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Stack.

I would like to see other countries' models of special needs support for children considered.  What models other than the SMA model are effective?  I am thinking particularly of cost and the cap.  We must ensure equality of provision for all children.  I would appreciate Mr. Stack's comments.  Adult education issues were also raised.  What does Mr. Stack have in mind in that regard?  Was he referring to parents of children with special education needs?  I am further concerned about second level support for children with dyslexia and other special educational needs, in particular given peer issues and the stress they are under in the context of fitting in and withdrawal from classes, for example where they are exempted from Irish, to work on something else.  It is a pointed matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900009#K00300","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355925600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Stack on his appointment.

Hopefully, a great deal of progress will be made for children with special needs over the next few years.

On another occasion, we can grill him on policy issues but for now I wish him luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900010#L00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1355925600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Stack, Mr. Mulkerrins and Ms. Griffin to the Joint Committee and wish them the best.

Nobody can underestimate the challenges which lie ahead, in particular at a time when resources are few and far between.  It makes things even more difficult.  There are a number of areas which must nevertheless be addressed.  I note in Mr. Stack's contribution his reference to the need for closer inter-agency partnership, in particular in the areas of health and education.  I agree.  As he reads into the role over the next couple of weeks, Mr. Stack will come across some of the difficulties in health and education regarding special educational needs.  The current HSE proposals on the reconfiguration of therapy services and their impact on children with special educational needs, particularly in specialist schools, have created fears among families that current services will be diminished by the move to more geographically based provision.  It is happening already in Cork and there were issues with implementation in Limerick.  Implementation in Meath seems to have been more successful than it was in Limerick.  I do not know why.  Consultation with the HSE will be very important to address the impact of the reconfiguration of services on special needs education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121900010#L00300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1355925600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I commend Mr. Stack on taking on the role.

If his record as a civil servant is an indication, his contribution as chairman will be something to which to look forward.  I commend Mr. Stack on his public service ethic in taking on the role and providing the benefit to the State and its education system of his experience and knowledge.  I wish him the very best.

The first job of a leader of any group is to use one's two ears before one uses one's mouth.  One must listen to hear what people are saying to avoid making decisions before discovering information one should have had in advance.  Deputy Tuffy's remarks on the perception regarding consistent allocation of resources are very useful.  It means I know I must keep an eye out for that.  As I speak to people I can learn about it and establish the position.  Senator Healy Eames's question about other models is worthy of further reflection and research to establish if there are better, more efficient ways to do things.  The focus of improvements must always be to further the educational interests of children.<\/p> <p>I do not mean cheaper or dearer but better in the educational sense.<\/p><p> Senator Averil Power put no specific question.

Both of us will make short introductory remarks and then we will answer any questions the Deputies, Senators and the Chairman may have.<\/p><p>  In December 2008, I acceded to a request from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to put my name on a panel from which he directed that certain Irish financial institutions would each select two individuals to become non-executive directors.  Each of the relevant institutions was participating in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and the appointments were made under section 32 of the 2008 Act.  In my case, I became a director of what was then called Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings PLC and which today is Permanent TSB Group Holdings PLC, the holding company for Permanent TSB bank.<\/p><p>  At the time of these appointments it was very clear that the banking and financial infrastructure of this country was in grave crisis and there was a complete absence of trust in the management and leadership of the various banking institutions in the State.  In that context I viewed my responsibilities on my appointment as being twofold: first, to represent, in so far as I could, the wider public interest in the deliberations of the board during this crisis; and, second, to help challenge the culture which had so clearly taken over the boardrooms of our financial institutions.  At the same time I and my colleagues in similar positions with other institutions acknowledge that while the circumstances of our appointments may have been unusual, we share the same legal and fiduciary responsibilities as the other directors of those institutions.  Ultimately, we can only seek to influence, as opposed to dictate, the policy of the boards on which we sit.<\/p><p>  In the case of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings PLC, the focus between the end of 2008 and the spring of 2011 was on trying to advise on and help shape the response of the company to the crisis.  There were many reasons that this was desirable, including the fact that we were conscious of the already difficult challenges facing the Exchequer at the time.  In March 2011 it became clear that it was not going to be possible to secure this.  At the end of month new requirements for capital for all banks, including Permanent TSB, were set down by the Central Bank and these meant that the bank would be required to take &euro;4 billion in additional capital from the Exchequer, becoming effectively nationalised in the process, as there was no possibility of raising the money from other sources.<\/p><p>  Following that the bank was the subject of a number of direction orders from the Minister which directed the institution, among other things, to facilitate the sale of the life and pensions business of Irish Life by the group to the Minister for Finance for &euro;1.3 billion as part of that recapitalisation exercise.  The Minister intends to sell that business on to the private sector and I believe he will recoup that amount in full at that time.<\/p><p>  In the year to date our objective has been to try to secure the return of Permanent TSB bank to financial stability and strength.  This has been and continues to be a very difficult challenge.  Unfortunately, like many other banks in Ireland and elsewhere, Permanent TSB made a series of unwise decisions late in the last decade.  Together those decisions brought the bank to the brink of collapse and it will require enormous effort, sacrifice and pain to restore it to health.  However, I believe we are making progress in this regard.  In March the bank secured the support of the troika for a restructuring plan to be submitted to the European authorities and that plan has now been submitted.  While we await the formal response of the authorities to that plan, the bank is already making substantial progress on its implementation.  In recent months in particular, the bank has addressed the problem of its outlier status in respect of the standard variable rate which it charges its residential mortgage customers and that rate has now been brought into line with the market.  The bank has invested in a state-of-the-art arrears management service which is already enabling us to work much more constructively with customers to help them manage their mortgage repayments.  <\/p><p>  Significantly, and correctly I should say, there has been a fundamental overhaul of the group board over the last number of years to the extent that no<i><\/i>current director of the group was a director at the time of the introduction of the bank guarantee in 2008.  In the same vein, there has been a fundamental overhaul of the senior management team at the bank.  Key posts have now been filled with candidates who never worked in the Irish banking sector before, including the new chief executive officer, the new financial officer, the new chief operations officer and the new head of strategy and planning.  I do not believe there is any financial institution in the country where there has been such significant change and renewal at senior management and board level after the crisis hit.<\/p><p>  The bank has also seen a very significant reduction in the numbers employed - down to 1,800 from some 2,400 a few years ago - as it adjusts its cost base to reflect its smaller scale.  It has undertaken a series of liability management exercises in which it bought back debt in the market at a very significant discount, benefiting the position of the bank and ultimately the Irish taxpayer by approximately &euro;1.2 billion to date.  We are about to oversee the return of Permanent TSB to the lending market in the new year when we will unveil significant lending targets for the bank in each of its key product lines for 2013.   <\/p><p>  I believe we are now demonstrating that there is real benefit for this economy in preserving Permanent TSB bank as a competitive force, that doing so presents the best way of managing the investment which the Exchequer has made in the bank and that the bank is capable of restoring itself to stability and resuming its place in the country's financial infrastructure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012121900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray MacSharry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355929800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I hope we can be of help to the committee in answering questions.  Like Mr. MacSharry, I joined the board of what was then Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings plc in December 2008 following a request by the Minster for Finance to join the panel to which Mr. MacSharry referred.  Mr. MacSharry has already outlined the circumstances surrounding our respective nominations and the expectation of the role we would play.<\/p><p>  As is also clear from his opening address, the company has undergone significant structural change in the period since then.  Today, the company has changed its name and is called Permanent TSB Group Holdings plc - the holding company for Permanent TSB.  The changes that have taken place within the company have undoubtedly been extensive in nature and were directed and driven by the board in response to the ongoing changes in the circumstances in which the company found itself and which it had to address.  In addition to those changing circumstances, Mr. MacSharry has spoken about the sense of crisis and the loss of confidence in the banking sector that was pervasive in 2008.  However, simply making that statement does not do justice to just how extraordinary the crisis was and how real was the threat to the country's financial system.  I have no doubt that at that time we were at a point where the very fabric of our banking infrastructure was in peril, and not just the continued survival of Permanent TSB itself.<\/p><p>  In the period since our appointment we have focused on trying, first, to ensure the survival and future viability of the bank in the face of unprecedented stress both in funding markets, and in the speed and extent of credit deterioration and the pressures that put on capital held by the bank.  We have tried to avoid having to take capital from external sources into the company.  We are now trying to support the stabilisation of Permanent TSB and its restoration to a position of significance in the banking world and the economy.  Mr. MacSharry and I are both satisfied that the bank has, since 2009, succeeded in building up a management team with the skill set and capability to meet the challenges facing the bank in the future, and the ability to realise the full potential of the bank as a real competitive force in the Irish retail bank market.<\/p><p>  A root and branch analysis of policy and strategy has been completed and the resulting restructuring plan, after presentation to the Government and the troika, has been submitted to the EU.  In the interim, work has already started on implementation of the plan with the full and enthusiastic commitment of all bank staff.  We have also worked with our fellow directors to try to ensure that the bank understands the wider context in which it operates and the responsibilities it now has to act in the interests of the wider community.  That is particularly relevant when it comes to issues such as interest rates, arrears management and assisting individuals and households to achieve their financial plans.  Those are the kinds of areas where the wider community has a keen interest in the policies adopted by individual banks.<\/p><p>  In that regard, I believe Permanent TSB has made significant progress in recent months not least, as Mr. MacSharry has said, by reducing unilaterally its standard variable rate, SVR, for mortgages and by establishing a professional arrears management unit to support its work with customers in arrears.  The next step is to complete the work, now well advanced, on delivering attractive new banking products to the Irish consumer, which meet his or her requirements and also help deliver some much needed stimulus to the economy.  The challenge for all on the board, and in management, is how to strike the correct balance between, on the one hand, protecting the money the taxpayer has invested in the bank and, on the other, acting appropriately in respect of its customers, and particularly its customers in arrears.  That is a very difficult balance to strike, but I can assure the committee that throughout my time on the board, no issue has generated more discussion and reflection than this and I expect this will continue to be the case for as long as the State remains a significant investor in the bank.  I too thank committee members for their attention and time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012121900004#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hayes.

I am going to move on because my time is limited.  There has been much discussion in this committee about the role of public interest directors, the appointment of which Sinn F&eacute;in believes was a token gesture and a farce.  The idea was that there would be people on the boards of directors of the banks who would not be allowed to act in the public interest but would be public interest directors.  Mr. MacSharry and everyone else here know that under the stabilisation Act every director must act in the public interest and must protect the taxpayer.  The late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, said he would consult with the Opposition parties on the possible candidates for appointment as public interest directors.  He did not consult with Sinn F&eacute;in on this matter.  Those appointed include three former assistant secretaries of Departments and four former Ministers, including two former T&aacute;naist&iacute; from across the political divide.<\/p><p>  I want to put the following on record.  During the past five years, Ms Hayes and Mr. MacSharry received &euro;271,000 and &euro;239,000, respectively, by way of remuneration as public interest directors.  During that same period Mr. MacSharry, as a former Minister, received &euro;445,000.  He is also a former EU Commissioner and Governor of the Central Bank.

This is important because it is a nice gateway to the next issue I wish to raise.  I wish to continue on an issue raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  As the delegates will see on the screen, the Personal Insolvency Bill is making its way through its Final Stages and we will vote on it this evening.  I regret that I will vote against it, having supported the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, the whole way through.  One of the reasons I have decided to vote against it - I made the decision today - is that Mr. Richie Boucher said yesterday that within the context of the personal insolvency legislation there would be no debt forgiveness.  Mr. MacSharry has also said there will be no debt forgiveness.  We will not be writing off any debt.  I appreciate the semantics between writing off debt and debt forgiveness and know no insult was intended.  As I find the phrase \"debt forgiveness\" insulting, I would like to use the phrase \"debt surrender\".  <\/p><p>  Let us take an example, which I find it is usually the best way to clarify these issues.<\/p> <p>Let us take the example of a Permanent TSB borrower who borrowed &euro;400,000, whose property is now worth &euro;200,000 and the change in her circumstances means she can now service a mortgage of &euro;250,000, capital and interest.  The specific intent of the legislation making its way through the Chamber and on which I am about to go and contribute, is that Permanent TSB would surrender &euro;150,000 worth of debt in the case of that borrower.  In other words, it would say to her that for, say, a three-year period it would leave her with enough to have a reasonable standard of living, it would take the rest and at the end of the three-year period her mortgage would not be &euro;400,000 it would be &euro;250,000.  That is the intention of the legislation and that, by the way, is in the public interest.  Unless I misinterpreted what Mr. MacSharry said, what I heard him say is the bank's position - he used worrying phrases such as \"we in the bank\" -  is a very different interpretation of how that example would work through.  Can he explain to the committee how he would see Permanent TSB engaging with that example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012121900011#K04000","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355934600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I was following on in regard to the same kind of questions that were asked of the chief executive when he was here when both sides, the committee and the chief executive, used the term \"debt forgiveness\".

The aim of the committee's examination is to prepare and publish a report on the strategy of and response by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the economic crisis, the Department's new responsibility for trade promotion and the role of trade promotion in economic recovery as outlined in the programme for Government.  The committee will examine the performance of the Department in these respects.  It commenced the process earlier this year with the formal adoption of a scoping document.  We have discussed the issues involved with senior officials of the Department.  We have also held meetings with the main State agencies involved in trade and investment.  A committee delegation held 30 trade-related meetings in three cities in the United States during June.  The committee also heard the views of the private sector from IBEC and the Irish Exporters Association.  It also intends to examine the way in which the visa system supports or inhibits trade promotion and meet organisations on the promotion of agricultural exports.  It intends to have meetings with other trade organisations and chambers of commerce during 2013.<\/p><p>  The purpose of this meeting is to examine the issue of trade with the Arab world.  A number of Arab countries have embassies in Ireland, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  Last year I visited Qatar where I met Irish business people operating there.  I was struck by their level of optimism about the possible benefits for Ireland from trade and inward investment from the Gulf region.  We met many engineers involved in the construction sector there and noted the existence of a Qatari-Irish business forum.  There may be similar fora in other Gulf states.  There are opportunities in the United Arab Emirates.  Etihad Airways operates 17 weekly flights from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  There has been a significant change in the relationship between Ireland and the Arab world and in our view there are significant opportunities for Ireland to improve its trade with these countries.<\/p><p>  We are joined by Mr. Louis Maguire whom I met earlier this year at the Joint Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce function in Dublin.  I was very impressed by this organisation.  Mr. Maguire is also the honorary consul of Tunisia.  I have no doubt that with his knowledge and experience of the Arab world he will offer a very interesting perspective on how Ireland can make the most of the opportunities in the region.  <\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.

I heard somebody boast recently that the value of our exports to the Middle East was &euro;3 billion last year.  I regard that as scratching the surface.  There are approximately 400 million Arabs in various countries in the Middle East.  The first point I will make is that every Irish company, regardless of what it has to offer, is welcome in the Middle East.  As I said at the function to which the Chairman referred, the Irish are more welcome in the Middle East than they are in any other part of the world.  In terms of trade promotion, we concentrate on Europe, which is an important market, but I recall that when I went to the Middle East in the early days there was no trade between Ireland and that region because there was an incorrect perception in some countries that Ireland was part of Britain, which stemmed from the occupation of the Six Counties.  I had to first clear the air by reassuring people that this was not the case and that we had our own Republic.  Once they heard that they all wanted to deal with Ireland.  I have been going to the Arab world on a regular basis a few times a year for the past 40 years; I first went there in 1972.<\/p><p>  There are many things that are right and many that are wrong in our country.  One issue about which I bitterly complain is that of access to visas.  For Arabs, whether they be dignitaries or people who want to work here or come here on holiday, obtaining a visa is an awful problem.  For example, if one was living in Tunisia and wanted to travel to Ireland, one would have to get a visa from our ambassador in Madrid.  Nobody in Tunisia is aware of that, and they must be advised of it.  We now have a consul in Tunisia, but that visa process is ridiculous.  Such an individual could possibly get a visa on arrival in Britain.  Addressing the processing of visas is one area to be examined if we are interested in expanding tourism.  <\/p><p>  A delegation from the Saudi Arabia tourist organisation visited here in 2010.  Many people might not think there is such an organisation in Saudi Arabia but there is.  That delegation was here for three days.  The members of it approached me on arrival and I met them.  They wanted to meet people in authority.  I will not pull any punches in saying that I contacted the Minister's office, but the Minister was not available to see them.  The Minister's secretary suggested I contact Tourism Ireland, which I did.  I asked whether these people could meet somebody in the organisation but there was nobody available to meet them for the two or three days they were here.  I then asked if Tourism Ireland could at least put a package together and send it to the Shelbourne Hotel where the delegation was saying, which it did.  I received a telephone call about a fortnight later from somebody in Abu Dhabi advising that he or she was looking after Tourism Ireland for Saudi Arabia.  If the committee members want to confuse me, tell me something like that - how somebody in Abu Dhabi could be looking after tourism for Ireland is beyond me.  I do not want to concentrate totally on tourism but I know the importance of the industry to every country.  It was very important to us in the past and we have lost a bit of it.  We as a nation are noted for going on holidays abroad and while our people travel all over the world, they mostly go to Spain and France and such countries.  There are beautiful tourist resorts throughout the Middle East.  One could have a lovely holiday in Morocco, Tunisia or Dubai at a much more reasonable price than one might imagine and there is no excuse for people not to travel there now that there are 17 flights a week, although they are mostly to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  It is time we opened up flights to countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, where there are great tourism opportunities, and I believe they would reciprocate by sending their people here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900003#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Louis Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1355927400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I believe there are charter flights to those two countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900003#B00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355927400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>There are charter flights to Morocco, but such flights may not be running to Tunisia.

Some are accredited to other countries, but that arrangement does not really work.  There are simple solutions to all of this.  Ambassadors are extremely important for business.  When I first went to the Middle East I went to Libya, Lebanon and Iraq.  I remember that the Iraqi ambassador in London at that time wanted me to go to Iraq and said he would set up appointments for me.  Not only did he set up appointments; he made appointments for me to meet every minister in the cabinet at different times.  I saw every one of them, and that was the start of Iraqi trade with Ireland.  If somebody as humble as me could help start trade, what could the Government achieve if Deputies and Senators were to go there?  In 1973, at the request of the Iraqi authorities, I brought a delegation of parliamentarians from the three major parties to Iraq and it was a very successful trip.  It was so successful that the following year Libya hitched onto the trade mission and I brought a delegation of parliamentarians to that country also.  The success of those missions was evident in those days.  I do not want to bore anyone with statistics but we are missing the boat in terms of trade and tourism and unless matters are rectified, things will not improve.<\/p><p>  If members have any questions I will do my best to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Louis Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1355927400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I am sure many members will want to ask questions.

I know from reading material over the years that he has been active in promoting this country in areas in which there has been potential for increased trade.  The Chairman referred to the Moroccan ambassador, whom I have got to know during the past few years.  He has been very active in this country.  I had some interaction with him during the term of the previous Government regarding the equestrian area.  We met groups that were over here at the time.  Mr. Maguire referred to tourism and the fact that a delegation from Saudi Arabia was not met by either officials from the Department or those from Tourism Ireland.  That is not acceptable in any day and age.  Irrespective of whether we are in good times or in the midst of a recession, people deserve to be met.  Irrespective of whatever can arise from such meetings, it is important that such people are met.<\/p><p>  Mr. Maguire mentioned that we have three ambassadors covering the Middle East region.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that our diplomatic network has done us proud as a country over the years.  Our diplomats, ambassadors and support staff punch above the weight of the country in providing public representatives and officials on trade missions with access to decision makers in those countries.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and his Department would love to have a greater network of embassies and consulates, but that is not easy in the current circumstances.<\/p> <p>There could be a reduction in numbers in some parts of the public administration and those concerned could be used to enlarge the trade and diplomatic network.  This is essential.  I note that there were exchanges between the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Crowe and me during Question Time in the D&aacute;il on Africa and the potential for trade there.  There are many new regions with potential for trade and the diplomatic network must be enhanced with additional personnel from within the existing public service numbers.  This could and should be done and while it would not be a simple matter, this area requires additional capacity in personnel.<\/p><p> In response to Mr. Maguire, I am not particularly concerned about where Irish people go on holidays.  As I would prefer them to stay at home in Ireland, I will not encourage them to go to any other part of the world.  My preference is for them to stay within the Thirty-two Counties and, were they to travel to stay in the south of Ulster, all the better.<\/p><p> In what areas in particular does Mr. Maguire discern an immediate potential for increased trade and for the sale of products to the Arab region?  Do particular areas stand out in which Ireland has the capacity and the right product to sell to potential new markets in that region?  I again compliment Mr. Maguire on his work, which, as he noted, goes back to 1972.  Over the years, he has involved members of the political process in visiting the region in delegations and so on and his work in that regard is to be admired and complimented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900003#B00700","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355928000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>There are one or two areas in particular.

He told me that while he was aware things were not 100% in Ireland, one person could run such an office and there would at least be someone on the ground who could keep people here advised.  Morocco is another place with which our trade is improving and there is vast potential there, as is the case in Tunisia as well.  Libya is coming back.  While we had great trade with Libya up to last year, it died off for a while, but I am glad to state it is back again.  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that Ireland cannot afford to have embassies in every country, but surely we can afford to have a one-person trade office.

The worst thing that could happen would be for the embassy from which one sought a visa to be located in a country of which one's own country was a former colony.  I can envisage all sorts of difficulties arising, depending on where one was obliged to apply for a visa.  For example, in the case of Madrid, the Spanish state formerly had colonies in parts of the Arab world, which would send the wrong signal as one would almost be going down the same path.  On foot of the budget, the amount of money available for this area is being cut back by approximately 2%.  This does not simply pertain to the Arab world, as one could make the same comparison regarding difficulties in the United States.  For instance, with regard to Silicon Valley, 40% of trade between the United States and Ireland comes from one particular region and the argument would be that one must increase the number of staff located there.  During the aforementioned Question Time exchanges with the T&aacute;naiste, we noted that in the course of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Government intends to recall a large number of staff at a time when it would be desirable for exports to be increasing, not decreasing, given the problems with the local economy.  While attempts are being made to save money by bringing back staff, in the long term we probably are losing out.  If running the six-month Presidency results in a drop-off of trade with these countries, it will be a major difficulty.  While this is probably a policy decision that must be made, I seek Mr. Maguire's views in this regard.<\/p><p>  Mr. Maguire made reference to the barriers posed by visas, but what other barriers exist in respect of trade?  Are there difficulties with Irish entrepreneurs travelling to that part of the world, in which there clearly are problems?  For example, Mr. Maguire mentioned Libya, where it appears that major difficulties persist on the ground.  There also are difficulties with regard to Bahrain, which members of this joint committee have raised, as well as having discussions on the sectarian nature of that state, in which one religion has clearly been the subject of discrimination.  Do these issues also create problems by constituting barriers to trade?  Moreover, do they form moral barriers to trading with some countries which clearly have bad human rights records?  Mr. Maguire mentioned travelling to Iraq, presumably during the period of Saddam Hussein's rule.  Do regimes, such as that headed by Gaddafi and some of the other dictators in the region, also pose problems?  I note there were problems in the past regarding insurance for products and so on.  For example, there were problems with regard to the transportation of beef.  Do these problems persist today?  What are the main products being exported to the region?  In the main, are they related to food and agribusiness?  Overall, I note the biggest export sector appears to be chemicals and related products.  Is the position similar for this region?  Given the region's instability, could Ireland get favourable status in respect of access to oil and so on?  Has consideration ever been given to putting in place a bartering system with some countries involving food for oil or whatever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900004#C00700","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355928000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>One must be careful about what one reads in the press about the Arab world.  The press tends to blow things out of all proportion.  I have been in the Middle East at times when there have been reports in Ireland of bombings, shootings and so on.  However, it does not always happen.  It happens in certain regions, just as one need not go too far to find shootings taking place in certain regions of one's own country.  However, there are no barriers to Irish goods.  The Deputy mentioned some of the products that Ireland is exporting.  During the 1970s and 1980s, Ireland's main export was beef.  At the time, we sold all our beef to Britain, but when it suddenly received a cheap offer from Argentina it decided to stop buying Irish beef overnight.  This was a serious problem for all farmers throughout the country, and I attended a meeting for which farmers sent their representatives to Dublin.  To give members an idea of how easy it is to overcome a problem, I got on a plane and went to Libya.<\/p> <p>I came back with an order for 1,000 cattle, which I gave to the late Mark Clinton, who was Minister for Agriculture at the time.  I was not away for more than a week, so one can get over obstacles very easily.  There is scope for a lot more than beef, although beef is coming back now.  We are into Saudi Arabia in a pretty big way with beef, as well as the United Arab Emirates.<\/p><p> Only last week, I was approached by one of the beef exporters who said he would like to get into Qatar.  I went to London with him and we saw the ambassador there who said he would have the ban lifted.  There had been a ban in place for many years since the time of the BSE outbreak in England.  I brought this gentleman to meet the ambassador and he put his case.  Last Saturday night, I had a phone call from the ambassador to say that the ban had been lifted and he was sending people here early in the new year to buy Irish beef.<\/p><p> The opportunities are there.  As I have said a thousand times, the door is open for anyone from Ireland who wants to sell anything.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900004#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Louis Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>It does to some extent, but are there difficulties with some countries' regimes?  Is the Joint Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce propping up those regimes by getting involved in trade with them, or are they being opened up to the idea or prospect of greater democracy, including human rights, in the region by continuing that trade?  That is one of the difficulties involved in trading with some of those countries.  For instance, the Iranian ambassador, when he attended this committee, spoke about the ban being lifted there.  There does not seem to be any credible reason Irish beef should not be exported around the world, but are they live exports?  I know there have been difficulties in the past with that aspect, including how the animals are killed.  Much of the beef in Iran is currently coming from South American countries, but Irish middle-men are bringing it in.  Is there a problem with the financial embargo on trade with Iran?

I concur with the concept of what Mr. Maguire is saying.  We frequently table parliamentary questions to all Departments concerning trade and interaction with African and Middle Eastern countries.  There is great scope for extending business there, particularly as countries develop.  As they progress the scope is much greater.  My colleagues and I have asked various Ministers to try to maximise their contacts with all foreign countries with a view to expanding our business with them and increasing our exports.  In addition, we should encourage their people to come here as tourists, as well as travelling abroad as tourists ourselves.  With no disrespect to my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith, if we all stayed at home there would be no tourism.  We cannot have that either.  We need to avail of every possible opportunity and identify the products that are most likely to gain a marketing foothold in the Middle East.  Mr. Maguire has already pointed out quite a number of those products.  Suffice it to say that we would all concur with that concept.<\/p><p>  We must have regard to human rights issues also.

I would have grave reservations about trading with America, for example, when one sees some of the human rights abuses there.  None the less, we can lead by example.  I hope Irish businessmen are ethical in their approach when signing trade agreements.  There are quite a number of organisations, which I support, that want country-by-country auditing so that taxes are paid in the countries in which they should be paid.  In that way we can try to eliminate tax avoidance and tax evasion.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Maguire said, there is a potential there, but it is disappointing that it is not being addressed meaningfully.

The Government has made it much easier, for instance, for Chinese people to get visas.  That happened largely as a result of a concentrated and targeted campaign conducted by interests in Ireland, including, for instance, the language schools which operate a big business, particularly involving students from China, and also tour operators which are trying to bring groups into Ireland but which are finding it almost impossible to get visa.

Unfortunately I did not hear his initial presentation as I was speaking and voting in the Seanad, and I will have to return to the Chamber to do the same again in a few minutes.  I was here when he made a remark to the effect that we need not concern ourselves about human rights and that he has never seen abuses.  However, they are widespread and they are widely known.  I say this as somebody who voted against the beef deals, including perhaps some that Mr. Maguire helped to negotiate, with Saddam Hussein's Iraq several years ago.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan pointed out, we have to live in a practical and realistic world, but I share her concern about the possible rebalancing of this committee to give greater prominence to trade and downgrade human rights.<\/p><p>  As one of the only Members to vote against the beef deal, the case of Iraq was instructive to me.  While it was admitted on the Government benches that what I did may have been the moral response, I was asked rhetorically whether Ireland could afford it.  As I am sure Mr. Maguire knows only too well, what actually happened was that war broke out and Saddam Hussein's Government welshed on the payments.  The Irish taxpayer was forced to pick up the bill under the export credit guarantee scheme.  We did the immoral thing and we paid through the nose for it.  I think the amount paid out was approximately &euro;79 million.<\/p><p>  In respect of Libya, it has emerged in the past week that the British Government has been forced to pay &pound;2.2 million to Mr. Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped by the Americans with the collusion of British intelligence services, taken to Libya and severely tortured.  His family, including his pregnant wife, were also kidnapped and brought to Libya.  They were deeply shocked by this.  To show these defilements of human rights are not uniquely an Arab phenomenon, the head of MI6, who is also a tub-thumping Christian, congratulated the then head of intelligence in Libya on the delivery of the \"cargo\" and wrote that while \"I know I did not pay for the air cargo\", British intelligence had ensured a safe arrival.  That is an appalling sentiment to express in regard to human beings who were illegally kidnapped - the Americans used the euphemism of \"extraordinary rendition\".<\/p><p>  I am making no differentiation between the Arab world and the Western world because both have been complicit in the violation of human rights.  My function as a member of this committee is to raise these issues.  I have raised violations of human rights by Arab regimes and the Israelis.  I am not interested in Jewish rights, gay rights, women's rights or Palestinian rights; I am interested in human rights.  I understand that people in the business world feel they have to make these contacts and it is difficult to raise ethical issues when this country is in such a parlous state.  This afternoon the Seanad will be discussing the Social Welfare Bill 2012, which makes savage cuts to carers' benefits and other areas.  I hope the Seanad will oppose the Bill and return it to the Government for further consideration.  I understand the difficulty in raising these issues when people are bleeding in our country but if the business is advantageous to others they will be unlikely to reject it if concerns are raised in a polite way and if our ethical position is presented, if we believe in it.  The Islamic countries are usually lacking in diffidence when presenting their views of morality.  We should not be completely tongue-tied.  My concern is for human rights generally and is not directed at Arabs specifically.  I would equally criticise the United States of America for the dehumanising effect of drone attacks, which are horrible.  We would be less than human if we shed this aspect of the committee's work, which I regard as equally important.  If this was only a committee on foreign trade I would not bother to attend its meetings.  I hope I have registered my concerns in a way that is not offensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900007#F00100","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I remind Senator Norris that the committee has spent as much, if not more, time dealing with issues of human rights than with issues of trade over the last several months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900007#F00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121900007#F00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Trade has not dominated our agenda and, in fact, some people are saying we are not doing enough on trade matters.

The Cornmarket Project was established in 1999 as a multi-agency response to criminality and substance misuse issues in County Wexford.  Each year, the project deals with approximately 250 individual clients with criminality and substance misuse issues, 170 of whom on average are direct referrals from the Probation Service.  The Cornmarket Project receives core funding from the Department of Justice and Equality through the Probation Service, and is under the umbrella of Wexford Local Development, the local development company in County Wexford mandated to deliver rural development, social inclusion and community development programmes on behalf of the Government.<\/p><p>  The project has an outcome-focused, community-facing and client-centred approach.  The Cornmarket Project's primary goal is to work in collaboration with the Probation Service and other partners to ensure positive behavioural change in medium to high-risk offenders with a concurrent reduction in recidivism.  To this end, the Cornmarket Project adds value to the work of the Probation Service by addressing issues of motivation, problem solving and skill building in offenders to diminish criminal behaviour and enhance resistance to substance misuse.  The methodologies used by the project are underpinned by evidence-based behavioural interventions delivered by trained staff concentrating on enhancing client motivation for successful participation in the rehabilitation and reintegration programmes delivered by the project and for moving offenders towards other suitable external progression routes.<\/p><p>  Enhancing offender motivation to make positive behavioural change lies at the heart of the work of the Cornmarket Project.  I hope that at the conclusion of this session the committee will be better informed about our change outcome and impact measurement, COAIM, system, which is based on evidence-based intervention techniques for offender programmes which have shown demonstrable effects in other jurisdictions.  The COAIM system uses unique evidence-based algorithms and metrics and was primarily developed to measure, and ultimately enhance, the determination to change in offenders who can very often be low in motivation when first referred.  Research on effective offender rehabilitation interventions suggests many existing programmes target offenders who are already motivated to make positive change.  However, a significant cohort of offenders needs a very structured motivational enhancement programme to enable them to get to this stage.<\/p><p>  In this regard we know from previous submissions to the committee by the Irish Prison Service that young short-term prisoners have the highest rate of re-offending, and this has also been our experience over the past 14 years.  In accepting this we can also point to a sub-category among this cohort of offenders with little or no motivation to change.  We also suspect that this category of recidivist offender places a significant burden on the State in terms of costs associated with Garda, court, probation and prison services.<\/p><p>  Tremendous work is being done by organisations working with offenders who are already motivated to make progress but if we do not also concentrate our efforts on those offenders who are harder to work with as they initially lack the motivation to make positive change we are likely to have a mismatch of resources in this area.  This can lead to missed opportunities, particularly with regard to enhancing and maintaining motivation for positive change with this significant cohort of offenders with low motivation to do so.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, an important new Irish research study undertaken jointly by the Probation Service and the CSO was published recently, and was the subject of an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> last Monday by Mr. Vivian Geiran, the director of the Probation Service.  In this article, Mr. Geiran stated:<blockquote>Clearly, custodial sentences are warranted for those who commit very serious crimes and who represent an ongoing danger to the public.  However, it is extremely difficult to rehabilitate offenders through imprisonment alone.  While prisoners deserve rehabilitative opportunities as well, offender rehabilitation programmes are most effective in reducing risk of reoffending when they are delivered in the community and target key risk factors.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The Cornmarket Project seeks to target this offender group through the provision of a community-based rehabilitation and reintegration programme which, through the use of the COAIM system, targets the main criminogenic antecedents in a very planned manner which in turn, encourages desistance from crime.  At this stage I am talking not only about offenders who have been before the courts and who are on probation but also low-motivated ex-prisoners returning to the community and those who have found themselves in trouble again with the criminal justice system and who may well be on the road back to prison.<\/p><p> A strong driver for reliable assessment, monitoring and outcome measurement systems has been to satisfy funders and other decision makers.  However, the COAIM system also recognises the importance of the offender's perspective and involvement in the measurement of their participation in rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, particularly as a motivational enhancement strategy.  It is hard to ignore the issue of system integrity if offender input to the measurement of programme efficacy is excluded.  Therefore, the COAIM system challenges conventional methods of measuring programme outcomes where the offender is the passive recipient of programmes and services and the deliverer of those services decides how beneficial they are or were for the offender.<\/p><p> The tools of the COAIM system are predicated on assessing, targeting and measuring factors that can be changed in the lives of offenders, known as dynamic factors.  Those that cannot be changed are static factors and include prior record or family criminality.  There is general agreement throughout the international research literature concerning the ten main dynamic or criminogenic target areas that need to be worked on with offenders in order to reduce recidivism.  Committee members will already have these ten areas outlined in some sample documentation and tables that were supplied prior to today's meeting.  Studies have shown that programmes that target four to six of these criminogenic risk factors more than non-criminogenic risk factors can have a 30% or more effect on recidivism while programmes that target more non-criminogenic risk factors have virtually no effect.  This research also suggests that community based-programmes that demonstrate good evidence of effectiveness include evidence-based behavioural therapies, intensive case management, a multi-systemic approach and interpersonal skills training.<\/p><p> Historically the development of services for offenders in Ireland has not always been marked by adherence to best practice based on empirical evidence.  Expediency, personal conviction and a sincere desire to do something to respond to anti-social behaviour and criminality in our communities have been more common drivers.  However, policy development in Ireland in recent times concerning offender reintegration strategies seeks an increasing use of community options including non-custodial alternatives to prison and in suitable cases, the use of back-door strategies involving some form of early release while also seeking a reduction in expenditure.  We suggest that the COAIM system that is at work in the Cornmarket Project, together with its range of tools, can assist in meeting these requirements and thus support the overall penal reform agenda.<\/p><p> We are now in a new era that presents both challenges and opportunities.  We must develop new approaches and ways of working to meet the needs of today for the users of the services, the funders and the communities in which we all live.  Those charged with effecting positive change regarding offender reintegration and rehabilitation are asked to demonstrate programme efficacy, value for money and evidence on client outcomes.  Departments, funders and other stakeholders, including this committee, are increasingly seeking that credible and validated outcome-measuring systems are in place in State-funded organisations.  We believe the system at work in the Cornmarket Project can help to fulfil these requirements.  We hope our submission will make a positive contribution to the work of the Sub-Committee on Penal Reform and to the wider discussion on evidence-based best-practice rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355925300,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Delaney for a very impressive presentation.

Focus Ireland has been working very closely with Seamus Sisk on the implementation of the integrated services management system.  Through that engagement, we were able to form partnerships with the Prison Service, the Probation Service, the HSE and other NGOs with which we work closely.  Initially from 2007 we worked in the Dublin prisons and then had the opportunity to expand to Limerick in 2009 and Cork in 2010.  We are in the process of negotiating starting in the D&oacute;chas Centre prison in 2013.  In the Waterford area we have commenced a project around community service.<\/p><p>  We are engaging within the prison and outside the prison, which has been a key aspect of our learning and success.  We develop those relationships, develop the trust and continue working with people when they are discharged to help settle them back to have a place they can call home, living independently in the community.  We are dealing with people with high levels of mental health problems and many of them have addiction issues.  There is a cohort of young people who have been in care and have come through the prison system.  Other aspects of our work manifest themselves in what we see in the prison area.  We have worked with several hundred people during the years we have been operating and have learned a great deal.<\/p><p>  I would like the committee to focus on four things.  The first is the assessment of housing need of people who are admitted into the prison system.  The earlier that assessment can be done the more opportunity it will give us to help preserve any home situation somebody may have so that he or she does not lose that home, especially in the case of those who are in the prison system for a very short period of time.  Focus Ireland is trying to shift much of its emphasis to preventing people from becoming homeless.  Our work in the prisons is very much geared around that and all the outcomes we measure focus on how we prevent people from becoming homeless.<\/p><p>  In doing that assessment an holistic care plan is prepared by our project worker engaging all the relevant services needed to ensure success upon discharge.  We need more tightening of the planned discharge so that we can manage the release of people back into the community.  It would be very beneficial for us to have more units of supported temporary accommodation.  We have been able to provide some of Focus Ireland's stock of housing in the Dublin and Limerick areas.  Unfortunately we have not yet been able to secure any accommodation in Cork.  We would certainly need more units of supported temporary accommodation where we can manage the release of people from prison so that they do not fall into the homeless system and do not fall back into their old ways.  We can actually start them on a better life for the future.<\/p><p>  The final thing on which the committee should focus is how these services get funded.  We have been very fortunate to receive some contribution from Pobal's dormant accounts fund over the years.  However, that has all dried up and the ongoing continuation of our work is purely funded by public donations to our organisation.  Having said that, when we measure the outcomes for the people with whom we have worked the number who have remained settled in the community and not re-engaged in the prison system is extremely positive.  Many people, including the prison governors and those in the probation services, have said that the people with whom we are working are of the highest level of need and yet we have had a great success rate in reducing the levels of recidivism.  While what we are doing is not the whole story, it is a contribution to reducing recidivism.  We would be happy to take questions at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joyce Loughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1355925300,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Loughnan for that interesting presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900004#D00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355925300,"counter":660,"content":"<p>It is an absolute honour to be here with such established organisations as the Cornmarket Project and Focus Ireland.

We are based in the south inner city.  We found that there is a need presenting itself through our support of temporary accommodation in the local community for community-based information and support services for ex-offenders and their families.<\/p> <p>The project was originally set up as a six month pilot project in October 2011 but the need was so great that it was extended and we are hopeful it will run on.  We had plans to work with 30 ex-prisoners in a six month period.  We were delighted the Chairman, Deputy Stanton, launched our impact report in October.  We worked with 280% more people than originally planned.  This includes the family members as well as ex-offenders.  Primarily, we are an information, support and referral service.  We do not want to duplicate the work already in place for service users.  Ours is a place of contact, where people can come in for a cup of tea and a chat about where to go next.  Housing and social welfare benefit are high on the list of priorities.<\/p><p> It is heartening to see that we are following in the footsteps of what others are doing.  At the beginning, we decided to measure impact and examine outcomes.  We looked at numbers and the soft and hard outcomes of working with people.  These are early days and it is hard to tell what will happen down the line.  At the moment we have a 0% reconviction rate for everyone who has interacted with the service in just over a year.  Hopefully, with the work we are doing, that success rate will be maintained.<\/p><p> We have a free counselling service and our written submission on international best practice refers to family support as a hugely important part of our service.  International research shows that when a family is supporting someone coming out of prison and where there is a family mediation network, the person is more likely to reintegrate into the community and less likely to reoffend.  We get many calls from mothers, wives and girlfriends and we arrange free counselling for children when people are taken into custody.  There is a major emphasis on family support.  Instead of just working with ex-offenders, there is an emphasis on people affected by imprisonment.<\/p><p> Another reason for success, which is in line with international best practice, is that we are piloting a peer support model.  We do not have direct State funding or constant streams of funding, although we received some funding from the St. Stephen's Green Trust and the American Ireland Fund and we are lucky enough to have two community employment placements through the Carmelite Community Centre.  We are also working with volunteers.  The group of people working and volunteering with us includes two ex-prisoners.  Their in-depth knowledge of the regime and the system is of huge importance to us.  The written submission refers to the peer support model being piloted in Scotland.<\/p><p> It has been a positive start although it depends what way one looks at it because the need for our service exists.  Until the end of September, we had worked with over 133 service users.  The current figure is over 150.  We receive some 20 inquiries every week.  We also have active key caseworkers working on care plans, such as the client centred approach.  We meet with them and every so often there are phone calls, e-mails and people dropping in for information.  There has been a major demand for our free counselling service.  We are learning as we go along and we are trying to put these things in place, hoping that the impact report and the work we do will allow us to continue next year.  We have been lucky with the local community in that people have referred family members to us.  We have worked with the prisons and we have also been invited to speak to prisoners in the pre-release period.  Although we have spoken to men so far, we have also been invited to the D&oacute;chas Centre.  We tell them about the service and many of them contact their family members who contact us before their release.<\/p><p> With regard to pre-prison preparation, we have been flexible in the pilot phase in seeing where the need exists.  Parents and mothers of people awaiting sentences contacted us and we linked up with them and created a support group for those getting ready for prison.  We explained the importance of linking in with the integrated sentence management, ISM, system when in prison, taking advantage of educational opportunities and making the most of the sentence.  We were lucky enough to be brought into Mountjoy Prison on a tour with two ISM officers showing us the process.  It is all about multiagency working, collaborative work and seeing where we can fit in to support ex-offenders reintegrating into the community and their family members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900004#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Grogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355925900,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Grogan and I congratulate her on the work her group, Care After Prison, is doing along with the Cornmarket Project and Focus Ireland.

The group has been in place for a long time.  I am very familiar with Ms Grogan and Care After Prison, which has been very impressive in a short space of time.  The two groups present two different experiences.  In respect of the Cornmarket group, organisations such as this work in specific areas and carry out important and useful work that has tangible outcomes.

Focus Ireland emphasised housing as a key issue, which is also emphasised in the research and by the other groups that have appeared.  The difficulty in accessing accommodation is a key factor in increasing the risk of recidivism on release.  What is the best way to try to roll out a system to ensure a national strategy on this?<\/p> <p> We have heard from the State authorities about the community return programme that is being piloted by the Probation Service and Prison Service.  Would anyone like to comment on it or on the recommendation that Care After Prison made to us before, that there be a structured release and community return programme?  A structured, national community return programme for medium and high risk offenders would reduce the incidence referred to by Focus Ireland of unplanned early release leading to people falling into homelessness.<\/p><p> Care After Prison also made the point that people sentenced for non-violent offences to terms of less than six months should really be diverted from the system entirely, given the high rates of recidivism, particularly with young people who have been given short sentences.  There is a difficulty with having any structured programme in prison and post-release where the person is sentenced to six months but is out after two months.  Should we look at structured community return for longer term sentences and diversion programmes instead of shorter sentences?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900005#E00500","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355926500,"counter":669,"content":"<p>It is important there is a structure in place to enable people to avoid prison while serving their sentences in managed way.  We are currently finishing an evaluation of our three services and we will have good recommendations stemming from those in line with identifying other avenues for alternatives to prison sentences.  The reason for focusing on that is the overcrowding that is happening in the prisons.  We must address that because overcrowding is the cause of unplanned early release.  If we can address that we can have a way to manage the situation.<\/p><p>  Currently we operate two programmes, one in Dublin and one in Waterford, in partnership with the Probation Services.  These are community service projects, where people finish off their probation, serve time in the community and are linked in with supervisors from the Probation Services.  It operates on a three to five day programme, where they come in two or three days a week and serve a number of hours, doing work such as gardening and painting and decorating.  That is all managed and supervised by a maintenance team in cooperation with the Probation Service and it is working well.

They can then start preparing for their discharge in a managed way, so there is a full care plan where we can link in all the appropriate services in the community.  It is not just about having a house but having the support that allows someone to then live independently in the community where they know we will continue to provide the service for as long as they need it, most intensively upon discharge, but it could go on for years as they address the issues they have in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joyce Loughnan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355926500,"counter":671,"content":"<p>We mentioned integrated sentence management in our written submission for sentences of more than 12 months.

No one would be released then with nowhere to go and unaware of the services available.  In some cases, we work with someone with a release date but something might happen and that person is released a couple of weeks early.  The preparations are in place but the person was released early and the release that was being anticipated does not happen.  It is best if the relationship starts as early as possible in the sentence.<\/p><p>  We have been invited to meetings where the teachers have a festival of services, with people attending from the colleges and community services, so prisoners can meet them before release.

The day has gone when we can rely on outputs alone to make that arguments.  It is not enough to simply say to the judge that the Cornmarket Projects works with 300 people a year, he or she might want to know the impact of the behavioural changes that have come about as a result of that work.

They are based on best international practice.  The concept is that if we do not address the ten key risk factor areas with offenders, the chances of reducing recidivism are appreciably lower.  One of the target areas we address is attitudes and cognitive style.  We work with offenders who have serious issues about how they interpret their impact on society.  Many are at the stage in which they do not look at the long-term impact of their behaviours.  We use a model called motivational interviewing, which is again highly respected as an intervention methodology in other jurisdictions.  We bring about a shift in negative attitudes and cognitive style as a precursor to working with people towards making positive change.  Another target area is offending behaviour.  The majority of people we work with, some 82%, have already been before the courts.  We work in a targeted way to enhance motivation to change what we call \"created discrepancy\" to build self-efficacy, not self-esteem, which is another dimension.  Many of the young offenders with whom we deal would not regard themselves of being capable of changing their behaviour.  That might sound strange but that is the reality.  We work to address that.  We also have them engage in pro-social activities.  Many of the clients we work with only become involved with other pro-social groups when they come into the project.  Many have been living and operating in a very narrow band of people who are also offenders.  <\/p><p>  Anger and emotion management is another area that is addressed.  Anger and emotion dysfunction can stem from a variety of complex issues but if it is not addressed it tends to pollute the progress that can be made in other areas.  Drug and alcohol misuse is another target area.  We work very intensively with people who have both drug and alcohol issues.  A key hallmark of our project is that we work with people with where they are on a continuum of services so we do not demand that they be drug or alcohol free in order for us to engage with them.  We have a continuum of services that are suitable for people on the dysfunctional end of the continuum and those who want to become completely drug and alcohol free.  Lifestyle and associates are tied in with the idea of pro-social activities and we link people in with other groups.  We link people into non-offending activities.  Another factor is training and employability.  We have a very good track record in moving people on, but only when they are ready.  This is at the heart of our programme.  At our team meetings we would be very careful not to set somebody up for failure.  If we feel somebody is not yet ready to take a work placement or a particular training course, we do not push them into it just because it is there.  If one does that, relapse rates increase.  We take a much more pragmatic look at it.  We also target accommodation, to which my colleagues from the other two services have just referred.<\/p><p>  The interesting fact about the COAIM system is that it gave us the statistics we needed to sit down with the housing authority in Wexford and set out the facts.  We used to have anecdotal evidence but we now have very clear evidence that accommodation is a serious issue for offenders.  That has changed the dynamic completely.  We have been able to have a businesslike conversation with the council and the borough council.<\/p><p>  Another key area is financial issues and debts.  I do not think I have come across a drug user who does not have substantial debts as a consequence of his or her drug use either for general services such as the ESB, gas, rent and so on or owing money to other detailers.  We constantly link in people with the MABS, which is a fantastic resource to us in Wexford.  <\/p><p>  As my colleague from Care After Prison said, relationships and family issues are a significant part of the dynamic.  We have built into our system a family support group, where we support the family members.  These are the ten criminogenic target areas.  It is not to say that other activities such as sport activities, adventure sports, art and so are not of good in and of themselves.  We run a number of other vocational skills programmes.  We do it as well as and not instead of the COAIM system.  We do it alongside it, so that every single client who comes into the project gets a change plan base.  They work up their change plan with our staff based on these ten criminogenic areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1355927100,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Delaney.

I, too, am not a member of the sub-committee.  As a Deputy from the Portlaoise area, I am familiar with the prisons in the town.  The issue of care after prison is my main concern and I apologise if the witnesses have addressed the issue.  Many prisoners receive early release, while others will complete a full sentence.  Do prisoners receive a discharge letter when they complete their sentence?  I have encountered cases where persons who are discharged on completion of their sentences have been told by the local community welfare officer or an official in the local social welfare office that their application for jobseeker's payments will not be processed without a discharge letter.  It may be a new development that the Department of Social Protection is specifically advising that persons who are on temporary release are not eligible for jobseeker's allowance because they are not available for work.  Community welfare officers are taking a similar approach and are requiring a letter of discharge.  These letters have become an issue recently.<\/p><p>   On the linkage into State agencies, some local authorities take a sympathetic approach to people who have completed a prison sentence, while others are unduly unsympathetic towards them.  The latter do not want to know about the circumstances of former prisoners and will try to move them elsewhere.  What are the witnesses' views on the different approaches taken by local authorities to former prisoners?  It can boil down to the attitude of an individual director of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900008#H00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355927700,"counter":687,"content":"<p>While levels of discrimination and inequality experienced by ex-offenders and their family members differ, they are a significant problem.  The types of offences for which a person has been convicted may limit his or her options for social housing, particularly if the conviction is for anti-social behaviour or sexual offences.  While I do not have full information on discharge letters, I am aware that persons on temporary release are registered in the system as being on temporary release and should liaise with the prison in question.  Again, however, the circumstances vary.  Some prisoners may be released during the day and return to prison at night, as in the case of the training unit in Mountjoy Prison, while others are released from Monday to Friday and return to prison at weekends.  The time a person on release will be available to work depends on the circumstances of his or her release.<\/p><p>  We work closely with Beatrix Sheehan, the community welfare officer in the homeless persons unit.  She is an amazing lady who is overworked and under-resourced.  Long queues form when she visits Mountjoy Prison to meet prisoners prior to their release.  Her work includes sorting out social welfare entitlements for prisoners by ensuring they do not leave prison without information, identification or letters.  This allows community welfare officers to deal with their cases immediately.<\/p><p>  The unfortunate reality is that a former prisoner's experience with local authorities will depend on the person he or she meets on the day.  We try to provide non-judgmental support.  We fill in forms with prisoners, direct them to the appropriate agencies and so forth.  Sometimes this involves making a telephone call in their presence to ensure they know where they should go and avoid scenarios where they knock on doors and are turned away.  This is a horrible but common experience.  When a person is motivated to make changes it can be difficult when doors are repeatedly closed in his or her face and obstacles are continually placed in his or her way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355927700,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms Grogan that prisoners are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and their experience will depend on individual circumstances.  Discharges are both planned and unplanned.  Where a discharge is planned, the former prisoner will have a better chance of having discharge letters and so forth arranged and it is more likely the community welfare officer will be on board.  Where a discharge is unplanned, the position is much more chaotic as it requires a crisis response from us as we try to make arrangements with the community welfare officer.  In our experience, our relationships with community welfare officers who know we work with prisoners and services becomes a factor.  They will work with us by recognising we are supporting somebody.  This is the reason we are able to advocate successfully on behalf of people and enable them to obtain rent supplement.<\/p><p>  In the majority of cases, the former prisoners in question will seek to access private rented accommodation or accommodation provided by housing associations such as Focus Ireland because local authorities do not have one bedroom properties for single males.  <\/p><p>  Where appropriate supports are made available, individuals may be able to reintegrate in their families.  Again, this depends to a great extent on whether the prisoner's release is planned or unplanned.  In the case of the former, we can engage with the family and support reintegration, whereas in the latter case, the position can be more chaotic and emergency accommodation must be found on a short-term basis to address the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900008#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1355927700,"counter":689,"content":"<p>None of the local authorities has housing available for anyone who shows up seeking accommodation because all of them have long waiting lists for housing.

The issue is not one of councils providing accommodation but one of councils making life difficult for former prisoners by refusing to process an application form.  The prison system is a structured environment where prisoners know at what time they will get up, go to bed and have breakfast, dinner and tea.

If that organisation has someone whose behaviour is unacceptable at a given point, that person could move across to our accommodation for a short period and then go back.

I came in when Paul Delaney was speaking.  It is important not to set someone up for a course that he is not able for.  A person may be unable to concentrate for so many hours in a day or perhaps it is not in his nature and that is probably part of the reason he ended up in trouble in the first place.  I am unsure who is best qualified to answer the question.  How do the delegations find dealing with F&Aacute;S?  The Probation Service is fine, the community welfare officers can be sympathetic and the Department of Social Protection will try to set a person up with a payment.  Perhaps a community welfare officer will tide him over for a while until all that gets done.  However, F&Aacute;S has an important role.  I do not believe the sympathy element comes in at a F&Aacute;S counter.  When organisations are trying to get someone onto a course it is important that F&Aacute;S is very much a part of the service to get people in during their first week out.  A person can go off the rails after one week if three or four doors have not opened for him.  What is the position with F&Aacute;S and the National Learning Network, which used to be called Rehab?  Both these organisations can help ex-offenders or ex-prisoners.

It relates to having an integrated plan for offenders.  We approach this with a case management plan.  In other words, we try to avoid exactly what Deputy Fleming has just referred to, that is, where a person is all at sea or bounced around.  The change outcome and indicator mapping, COAIM, system we use ensures that if we identify training as a need for a particular offender, then we are able to do the advocacy for them and we are able to take F&Aacute;S on board.  In fairness, it has worked rather well.  A representative from F&Aacute;S sits on our steering committee and F&Aacute;S is used to working with offenders.  However, we must approach this in a case management way.  I agree entirely with Deputy Fleming.  To ask offenders, especially homeless dysfunctional offenders, to do such work themselves invariably leads to failure.  Our COAIM system is predicated on having a plan.  We refer to it as a change plan rather than a care plan; there is a slightly different emphasis.  However, if one has a plan then the people who sit on our steering committee are committed to doing their part.  We need not reinvent the wheel.  If an organisation is responsible for housing, then that is what it does.  If an organisation is responsible for finance issues, such as MABS, that is the role it plays.  If an organisation is responsible for training and employment, then that is the role it plays as well.  We act as the bridge between these groups.  The case management approach is something that should be rolled out nationally because otherwise people will be left at sea and we have seen where that leads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU12012121900009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Delaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355928300,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I wish to add some comments.

The steering committee of the Cornmarket Project adds to this as well.  People can sit around and discuss the issues.  They do not discuss individual clients per se but our COAIM system is able to bring up factual statements rather than anecdotal statements.  Mr. Delaney referred to this earlier.  We have been able to sit down with the housing officers and make the case that in our open access drop-in area accommodation has come up to the high 70% region.

The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is a national organisation working to promote justice and empowerment for migrant workers in Ireland.  We have been taking a stand with migrant workers for more than ten years through service provision, advocacy and policy change.<\/p><p>  We have been working with undocumented migrants since 2001.  We have seen the cumulative and detrimental effects being undocumented has had on people in the State.  The issue is a serious one and is at a critical stage in this country.  We estimate that 25,000 to 30,000 undocumented people live in this country, including families and children.  Next year, 2013, as committee members are probably aware, is the year of immigration reform in this country and in the US.  This issue must be dealt with separately from the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill in order that we can clean up the system comprehensively.<\/p><p>  Data on undocumented migrants is limited but we have carried out a number of different studies with people who come through our doors.  A total of 75 different nationalities are represented.  People come from outside the EU and from all over the world.  The majority are more than 30 years of age and they have been here for at least four years, and many of them are undocumented for up to 15 years.  Approximately half of them have families and children living in the State.  That is a large number of connections to the State.<\/p><p>  In terms of a contribution, undocumented migrants spend &euro;180 million annually, which is a big contribution to the economy.  Many people have been engaged in employment for many years and have been with the same employer for more than four years.  They have been working and paying tax and PRSI contributions.  Many children are integrated into schools and their families are part of our communities.<\/p><p>  I will not go into the proposal we sent in detail but it relates to earned regularisation.  I will outline the benefits of an earned regularisation scheme.  It would generate in the region of &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million annually through fees, fines and additional revenue from undocumented workers and their employers.  It would bring the largest amount of undocumented people into the immigration system and enhance governance.  Residence would be earned over a five-year period.  There would not be an automatic right to residency.  It is not an amnesty; it is something that is earned over a period and mirrors the long-term residency system that is already in place.<\/p><p>  There are built-in safeguards to the scheme, which also works to root out unscrupulous employers in tandem with NERA and other agencies that are engaged in compliance.  It will improve overall public security and compliance and add credibility to our efforts in the US to regularise undocumented Irish people there.  The House has been active in advocating for the rights of the undocumented in the US.  It also provides a humanitarian response.  Failure to act is not an option.  The cost of deporting this group of people would be in the region of &euro;90 million.  It is untenable for the State to even begin to consider that.<\/p><p>  To date, we have received much support for earned regularisation.  We have received political support from Deputies and Senators across political parties.  The Labour Party has passed a motion.  We have also received support from Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and other councils across the country.  It has also been endorsed by a number of organisations that are listed in the submission given to committee members.  They include trade unions, business and religious organisations and voluntary and community organisations.<\/p><p>  We urge the committee to raise the issue with the Minister and to ask him to respond to the proposal on earned regularisation.  We seek an agreement as a matter of urgency that earned regularisation will be introduced in the State to give hope to people who are undocumented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121900003#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speech","time":1355910300,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGinley.

It is a pleasure and an honour, but also a huge responsibility, for us to be here today.  We would like to thank the committee for the precious time it is giving us for this presentation on the importance of the european foundation statute, EFS.<\/p><p>  The European Foundation Centre, the foundation sector in general and several philanthropists hope that Ireland will, during its EU Presidency, support this legislative proposal and make real progress to secure its adoption.  The Joint Committee could help in an effective way by bringing this issue to the attention of the relevant Ministers: the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter; the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan; and the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  <\/p><p>  It is our responsibility to convince the committee that this would be a good idea by demonstrating the status of the sector and why it is relevant and important.  On 8 February 2012, the European Commission issued a legislative proposal for a european foundation statute.  The proposal must now be endorsed by the co-legislators that is, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  Once adopted, this new European statute will not replace national laws but will act as an additional legal tool.<\/p><p>  The statute is a legal instrument that will allow philanthropists, individuals, families, corporations and foundations to set up a European foundation.  Once registered in a member state it will be recognised in all the other member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area.<\/p><p>  What is the importance of the foundation sector in Europe?  Approximately 110,000 foundations currently exist across Europe.<\/p> <p>Those foundations cover all the domains of the general interest and they support tens of thousands of beneficiaries on several issues.  The economic footprint of the foundations is significant because they redistribute their expenditure of &euro;100 billion every year.  Almost 1 million persons are employed in the sector, which does not include indirect employment, while between 1.5 million and 2 million volunteers help the work of the foundations.  It is also a growing sector.  For example, there is one new foundation every day in Spain while, last year, 800 new foundations were set up in Germany.  People from other European countries want to support beneficiaries in Ireland or other countries and cross-border giving is also increasing by 20% every year.<\/p><p> Why is it needed?  I work at the King Baudouin Foundation, which is one of the largest foundations in Belgium.  When we face people who want to act in the general interest in more than one country, they are sometimes blocked by administrative burdens, long procedures, several costs and not knowing where to start.  We live in times where we cannot afford that anymore.  We should facilitate philanthropy.  The more it is facilitated, the more engagement is facilitated and the more people are enabled to act in the general interest, which is much needed now.  A feasibility study was conducted by the European Commission and it estimated the additional costs of the legislative burdens at &euro;100 million, which is a significant amount.  That money could be used for purposes other than administrative burdens.<\/p><p> Philanthropists and foundations that want to act in more than one country often need to create a new legal structure or personality in other countries.  Members can imagine it is not easy for people to do that.  We have several concrete examples in this regard and during the question and answer session, we can highlight them to how important they are.<\/p><p> This process is being backed.  The foundation sector knows we are facing an important moment.  The EFC and many foundations and philanthropists have worked for years to motivate member states to work on this issue.  We know that we have never been so close to the EFC but we are still far away and we are quite realistic.  The DAFNE, Donors and Foundations Networks in Europe, which represents 6, 000 foundations also supports this legal process.  We have the pleasure of some backing from the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions.  The European Parliament endorsed us in 2011.<\/p><p> These are the key elements and I do not want to delay further because questions will be important.  The European foundation statute is a simple tool to promote philanthropy for the general interest and we hope, therefore, that the joint committee will help us in this regard and bring the attention of the relevant Ministers to this issue during the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121900004#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ludwig Forrest","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355911500,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Forrest for his presentation.

Mr. Forrest brought up the difficulties of operating across borders and setting up a foundation is difficult in itself.  However, one of the problems we face is that small countries suffer disproportionately in terms of cross-border philanthropy.  Few British foundations operate in the Republic of Ireland.  The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust is a notable exception but a great number of them operate in Northern Ireland.  They do not come south and one of the reasons is it is difficult to do so.

A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security, represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in such operations since 1958, a service that has comprised more than 61,000 individual tours of duty.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the United Nations and the European Union.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations.  This has included supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding our current economic difficulties, Ireland willingly continues to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world, providing professional peacekeepers for a range of missions throughout the world.  During 2011 the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on 12 missions throughout the world in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.<\/p> <p>Our main mission in the year under review was the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  At the request of the United Nations and following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force, comprising some 435 personnel, was deployed to UNIFIL in mid-2011.  The deployment to UNIFIL was Ireland's largest deployment overseas since the withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the MINURCAT mission in Chad in May 2010.  Reflecting the high regard in which Irish peacekeepers are held, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan took up the appointment of Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL for an initial period of one year in April 2012.  In June 2012, the Irish contingent was downsized to some 360 personnel following the deployment of some 170 personnel of the Finnish armed forces to UNIFIL and the formation of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion.  Partnership with other like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  I would like again to thank the Government and armed forces of Finland for participating in this mission with Ireland.  In the absence of partners such as Finland, the range and nature of overseas operations Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be significantly curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability, build experience and further deepen the excellent bilateral relationship between our countries.<\/p><p> The UN has stated that UNIFIL plays a vital role in stabilising southern Lebanon and particularly the area adjacent to Israel where Irish and Finnish troops are deployed.  South Lebanon has witnessed a period of unprecedented calm, thanks to the work of the mission as well as the excellent peacekeeping partnership between the Lebanese armed forces and UNIFIL, which are critical to maintaining stability in the area at a time of heightened tensions in the region.<\/p><p> Ireland is currently contributing 438 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world.  Also, around 150 additional personnel have been on stand-by for rapid deployment as our contribution to the German-Czech-Austrian battlegroup for the past six months and are due to be stood down at the end of this month.  This is a significant contribution in the context of the reduced resources available for defence and reflects the Government's continued commitment to international peacekeeping and to the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  Relative to our size and our available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.<\/p><p> It is important for Ireland to continue to build on our long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel to peace support operations.  I assure the committee that, notwithstanding the economic challenges we are facing, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.  However, our contributions will be practical and sustainable within the resources available for defence.  The Government and I place high importance on the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  Indeed, I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our military personnel serving overseas when I visited the Irish battalion serving with UNIFIL in October 2011.  I look forward to paying a return visit to our troops in Lebanon over the coming months.<\/p><p> A key facet of Ireland's approach to international peace support operations is the engagement of Defence Forces personnel at all levels with the local communities they are called on to serve.  Irish troops serving overseas not only display their professional commitment in fulfilling the UN mandate but also support and encourage local communities through humanitarian and community projects.  In Lebanon, previous Irish battalions have completed a number of projects over the years with financial help from Irish Aid.  I am delighted to see that recent battalions have continued this excellent tradition.<\/p><p> Our involvement in peace support missions has greatly enhanced the professional capacity and capability of the Defence Forces.  This has, in turn, increased our value to the UN.  The appointment of Irish officers such as Lieutenant General Pat Nash as Operation Commander for EUFOR Tchad\/RCA, Brigadier General Gerald Aherne as Deputy Force Commander of MINURCAT, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan as Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL and Colonel Michael Beary as Mission Commander of the EU mission for the training of Somali security forces is another indication of the high regard in which Irish personnel are held internationally.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I acknowledge the huge demands placed on personnel who serve overseas and on their families.  Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas under the auspices of the UN would not be possible.  Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well not only on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole and contributes to the excellent reputation in which Ireland is held among peacekeepers throughout the world.  We should all be conscious, in the context of the number of Defence Forces personnel we have across the world, that while some of us will be enjoying our Christmas dinners, they will still effectively be on duty in some of the more troubled parts of the world, serving the cause of peacekeeping and peace enforcement and continuing to enhance the reputation not only of the Defence Forces but of this State, as well as our commitment to and involvement in UN missions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121900002#A00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355930100,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Finland has the same policy of neutrality as Ireland, as the Chairman mentioned during a recent visit by this committee to Finland.  That fit is a good model for Ireland to proceed with.<\/p><p>  The Minister knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has concerns.  Although this meeting concerns the UN, I wish to raise the issue of the EU battlegroups and the sense that our proud policy of neutrality, which puts us in a position to be peacekeepers under the UN banner and play a role in conflict resolution as a neutral state that was colonised, has endured hardships and can understand the experiences of peoples we might be trying to assist, could be undermined by our being seen to be more closely allied with NATO.  Obviously, the use of Shannon Airport from 2003 was also very disappointing.  We have had this discussion before.  I understand that for practical purposes the Minister is not going to walk into a meeting as Minister for justice, equality and defence but rather as Minister for Defence.  He has to reiterate that and have it branded on his head in every discussion he has.  Our armed forces are something of which Irish people are proud and put us in a position of strength to play a constructive role.  What the Minister outlined today in this report is something of which the Irish people are rightfully proud.  These operations and partnerships with countries that share our values give us more moral weight to play a stronger role in human rights defence and conflict resolution.  I hope we do not drift into any kind of increased relationship with NATO, which we know has been responsible for operations that were not endorsed by the UN and which caused great devastation.  I am, of course, referring to the war in Iraq.  Overall, it is a positive report of which we are all very proud, but I have those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121900003#B00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1355930100,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond before we invite another speaker to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121900003#B00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1355930100,"counter":765,"content":"<p>Perhaps we can let members contribute generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121900003#B00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1355930100,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I welcome the report and acknowledge the significant commitment of the members of the Defence Forces since we started taking part in UN peacekeeping, the number of people who have served in the Defence Forces through the UN and the members of their families, because their families have sacrificed much as well and give up much for the people who are overseas.<\/p> <p>At this time of year in particular, we must acknowledge those members of the Defence Forces who are overseas on United Nations missions and remember their families who are without their loved ones at Christmas.

The Minister mentioned southern Lebanon, which he said was rather calm at the moment.  Is it the view of the Minister and the Defence Forces that the area has stabilised over the last three to four months, particularly along the border with Israel?  Are there any UN troops in the Gaza area who could become involved in peacekeeping and peace-making?  If we want to bring peace to the area, we will need the support of UN troops on the ground to prevent violence.  I would like to know the Minister's views.

I hope that is our political agenda.  It is the agenda of the UN.  Ireland is recognised as an impartial, neutral country which has contributed a great deal to international peace.  Our soldiers are respected by all sides in any conflict and I would not like to see that change through an unnecessary involvement in battlegroups.

They are part of the European Common Security and Defence Policy and are in place to provide assistance in emergency peacekeeping, peace enforcement and humanitarian relief.  It is important within the context of the EU, where we have common values and beliefs, that the Defence Forces will be equipped to respond appropriately to deal with humanitarian disasters and peacekeeping and peace enforcement issues.  Battlegroups provide an opportunity for member state forces to work together in various compositions.  There are 21 EU member states in NATO; the battlegroup concept provides for a degree of interaction and creates possibilities for interoperability and sharing and pooling of equipment.  Co-operation needs to be developed and deepened to ensure that at a time of financial difficulty there is not an unnecessary duplication of resources in Europe in the defence area.  The battlegroup concept is important and has nothing to do with our neutrality.  It is about continuing to engage in Europe and to be seen to be available to assist when there are emergencies which require humanitarian interventions or where a European peacekeeping engagement emerges in some shape or form.  I despair when this matter is constantly dug up as if our virgin neutrality is about to be violated.

There is ample information available on the purpose of the battlegroups.  They have not been engaged but they are there as a stand-by.  I agree with Deputy McGrath that I could think of something better to call them than battlegroups, but that is the term we have inherited.  They are not about to declare war on anybody or invade any country; nor are we.  Waving the flag of neutrality is artificial in the context of the purpose of battlegroups.<\/p><p>  I revert to the matter before the committee, which is UN peacekeeping missions.  I thank the committee for its support for the engagement of the Defence Forces overseas, which is very important and provides an outlet for the substantial training members receive.  It facilitates career ambition and ensures that members of the Defence Forces get the opportunity to use the skills they acquire in training in a positive way in troubled parts of the world to protect lives.  Deputy Moynihan is right to mention the families of members of the Defence Forces, particularly at Christmas.  It is hard on wives, children and parents whose loved ones are abroad not to see them at Christmas time.  It is part and parcel of service in the Defence Forces, whose members look forward to serving their country and the United Nations abroad and making a positive contribution.<\/p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about the types of project the Defence Forces carries out on humanitarian assistance missions overseas.  Our Defence Forces are particularly effective at forming good relationships with local communities.  Southern Lebanon is an example.  Defence Forces members do a great deal more than some other peacekeeping forces internationally in this context, particularly in those towns adjacent to headquarters.  It contributes to good relationships, keeps tensions down and ensures they are welcome in the areas in which they are deployed, as opposed to being seen as a hostile foreign force.  In Lebanon our long track record means the local community is very supportive of Irish troops.<\/p> <p>Being engaged with and supporting local community activities is very important.  This was demonstrated in the past in Lebanon in practical ways, for example through the provision of medical clinics and other services to the local population.  They undertook various other humanitarian tasks.  Members of the Defence Forces have very effectively taught English in local primary schools and formed relationships with children, parents and teachers in those schools.  The Defence Forces recently identified two projects as suitable collaborative humanitarian aid projects between the Defence Forces serving with UNIFIL and Irish Aid.  There is a vegetable drying machine project for a women's agricultural co-operative in Bint Jubayl and a mapping project to assist a Lebanese association for literacy in Tibnin.  Irish Aid has given funding to both projects and in the past year it has also funded two projects which were supported by the Defence Forces: the installation of solar-powered street lighting in Ayn Abil and the erection of a fence around the water hole in Bayt Yahun.  There are various engagements - some small, some more prolonged - in which the Defence Forces engage which contribute to building good relationships with local communities.  They are something to be encouraged.  When I last visited Southern Lebanon I visited the local school where members of the Defence Forces were engaged and were coming towards the end of their term.  There was sadness at losing the members, who were contributing positively to the children.  It is a very useful and valuable type of engagement and creates a perspective in which our soldiers, men and women, are contributing to the community and not just keeping an eye on them for peacekeeping purposes.<\/p><p> Deputy Finian McGrath referred to my comment that things are reasonably quiet in Southern Lebanon.  I hope that continues to be the case.  The important point to remember is that under the surface there are tensions in that region in the context of Hizbollah and the Israelis, but there has been a period of relative peace and calm.  No one can predict at what moment some form of hostility will break out.  The hope is that this will not be the case.  So far, southern Lebanon, where our troops are placed, has been largely unaffected by the chaos in Syria, which has affected other parts of Lebanon.  There is continuing concern about the horrendous conflict in Syria, which does not appear to be coming to an end.  Efforts by the UN to mediate some calm or a period of peace, or to seek to stimulate discussion to bring about a peaceful change of regime, have not so far proved fruitful.  It remains a concern that events there could spill over into Lebanon or may influence other actors in Lebanon to distract international attention from what is happening in Syria.  It is estimated that more than 40,000 people have lost their lives in Syria.  The Assad regime has killed civilians.  Others have also died at the hands of those opposing Assad and those engaged in civil war.  The number of deaths is beyond anything that is acceptable and a political resolution of that conflict is needed.  It seems that President Assad and those around him are intent on seeking to retain power in Syria and those opposed are intent on trying to remove him.  For as long as Syria is completely destabilised by the current civil war, one cannot be sanguine about any part of that region.  There is obviously a particular need to remain vigilant in southern Lebanon.  It is unlikely that difficulties will arise in the context of the Syrian conflict.  If some conflict were to occur involving Hizbollah and the Israelis as a diversion from the Syrian conflict, it would have occurred by now.  There was a concern that this would happen, but it does not seem to have.  Despite their country's difficulties, the different parties and communities in Lebanon are trying to ensure that a degree of peace and stability is retained.  There was always the danger that the Syrian conflict could have a serious impact on Lebanon.  While some of the political commentary suggested that would happen, we have not so far seen the types of difficulty in Lebanon that have occurred in the past.<\/p><p> Deputy McGrath mentioned the two-state solution.  I do not wish to turn this into a committee on foreign affairs, but it remains the objective of the Government and of the European Union to bring about a two-state solution in the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  A whole range of things make that extremely difficult, including the reality that two entirely different regimes operate on the Palestinian side - one in Gaza and one in the West Bank - which do not talk coherently to one another.  They continue trying to unify but it does not work.  There is a great irony in the fact that the T&aacute;naiste could visit Gaza but the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, cannot visit Gaza because his life would be at risk.  There are many complex strands that render achieving a two-state solution extremely difficult.  On occasion we unduly simplify those strands in our dialogue here.  As a country that had to work its way through a relatively complex peace process it could be very helpful if we recognised that the difficulties in that region are a great deal more complex than the ones we had to address.<\/p><p> I believe I have dealt with all the issues raised.  I look forward to visiting the troops in southern Lebanon again.  I intend to do so around the St. Patrick's Day holiday and I will make a point of conveying to them the full support of this committee and the Oireachtas for their important work in UNIFIL.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121900004#C00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355931300,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I shall be brief.

That is the recommendation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  The second petition is P00035\/12 from Ms Helena Corcoran in respect of electro-magnetic radiation.  The recommendation is that as a preliminary step, the committee request an update from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue, as the expert group report dates back to 2007.  In referring the petition the committee could also ask the Department to confirm that a national research programme was set up, as suggested in the statement of March 2007.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  The third petition is P00045\/12 in respect of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the petition made by Mr. Donohoe.  We have agreed that we write to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence to ask whether there are plans to amend the relevant legislation to allow petitioners or specific cases to be heard.  We will also refer the specific case to the ombudsman.  During 2013 when the appropriate ombudsman comes before the committee to present an annual report or is due to visit, we recommend that we write to the ombudsman in advance to ask that the ombudsman address the specific case in reply.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  The fourth petition is P00049\/12 in respect of road traffic accidents.  The recommendation is fivefold.  It is recommended that as a preliminary step, the petition be forwarded to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence asking that he address and report back to the committee on the following issues: first, his view on assigning responsibility for recording road traffic accidents to qualified statisticians; second, how the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assess requests for information under the Data Protection and Freedom of Information Acts; third, whether there is any intention to start recording road traffic accidents in the same manner here as in the North of Ireland; fourth, if there are plans to change or improve the layout of the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and, fifth, if it is feasible for those responsible for publishing data to provide information on the website on the actual road or roads where accidents occurred.
