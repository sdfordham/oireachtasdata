If it is found that the Irish tax base has been eroded, then action would be taken as appropriate.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has assured me that Revenue will make the fullest possible use of any relevant information in pursuing any cases where it appears that tax liabilites have not been addressed.\u00a0 I have written to the Chairman assuring him of my support for any legislative measures that may be needed to tackle any issues which\u00a0are identified by this\u00a0work.<\/p>  <p>  International tax evasion is a worldwide problem which can only be tackled effectively when countries work together.

It is also NAMA's established policy to sell assets, be they individual units or property portfolios,\u00a0on the open market.  So, while a transaction such as the one\u00a0referred to by the Deputy would, naturally, attract investors who wish to purchase a certain class of asset, this does not impact\u00a0the\u00a0capacity for\u00a0similar\u00a0market participants\u00a0to bid for those assets.<\/p>  <p>  I would also wish to\u00a0refer\u00a0the Deputy\u00a0to the NAMA Chairman and\u00a0CEO's appearance\u00a0at the Housing and Homelessness Committee on 11th May 2016.\u00a0NAMA's opening statements and presentation to the Committee are available on NAMA's website.  During his opening statement, the NAMA Chairman pointed out that 88% (or 11,219) of the 12,781\u00a0residential property units sold from NAMA's portfolio were sold on the open market by NAMA debtors and receivers in individual sales transactions to individual house buyers. <\/p>  <p>  The relatively small number of remaining units, 1,562 units, (12% of the total) were sold on the open market by NAMA debtors and receivers as part of larger group or portfolio sales.  The properties\u00a0that were sold in groups or portfolios were typically already tenanted and vacant possession was not sought prior to the sale.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am\u00a0advised by NAMA that the property referenced by the Deputy is in keeping with this trend as it\u00a0was fully\u00a0occupied by rental tenants\u00a0at the time of the sale and vacant possession of the units\u00a0was not sought. \u00a0It is not surprising that the sale of these\u00a0rental\u00a0units would be attractive to institutional landlords rather than aspiring\u00a0owner occupiers. \u00a0Portfolios like this are\u00a0generally acquired by investors, such\u00a0as REITs,\u00a0who are\u00a0seeking long-term stable\u00a0rental income\u00a0rather than seeking to sell the properties in the short-term. \u00a0Existing tenancy arrangements tend not to be impacted by such sales. \u00a0Contrary to the Deputy's\u00a0contention, a\u00a0sale of these units on an individual basis\u00a0to owner occupiers could be more\u00a0likely to\u00a0lead to the displacement of existing\u00a0tenants.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, I am firmly of the belief that REITs participation in Irish market is a positive step for many reasons.  This is why I,\u00a0through the Finance Act 2013, established\u00a0the REIT framework which allows for modern collective investment ownership structure of real estate that provides benefits to both small and large real estate investors,\u00a0provides benefits to the Irish property market and to\u00a0the broader economy.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, REITs support the rental sector through the professional management of both commercial and residential property.  The long term return expectations of REIT investment capital\u00a0ensures a proper focus on investment, enhancement, maintenance and efficiency of rental properties.  Over the long term investment capital from REITs is expected to provide a greater and much improved stock of professionally managed rental accommodation in the Irish market ultimately contributing to\u00a0greater security\u00a0of supply and tenure for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[10202\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is confident that the fundamental economic indicators remain positive and that economic growth will remain in line with expectations in 2016 and for the foreseeable future; if corrections or improvements are necessary to ensure economic performance in the short, medium and long term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>In general, recent indicators have been very positive, indicating the economic recovery is strengthening in a sustainable manner.

This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth, with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had thirteen successive quarters of employment growth.  Last year, employment increased by 2.6 per cent, equivalent to 50,000 new jobs.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 8.4 per cent in April, down from almost 10 per cent a year earlier.  This is the lowest rate of unemployment since December 2008.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are several sources of uncertainty. Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.  Growth in Emerging Market Economies disappointed in 2015, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, we would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy. Brexit is another downside risk facing the Irish economy with Ireland potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit. <\/p>  <p>  Domestically, the high level of private debt, while falling, remains a concern, and any deterioration in the external environment could prompt households and firms to raise the pace of deleveraging, with adverse implications for domestic demand. <\/p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.<\/p>  <p>  In summary,\u00a0I am confident that significant economic progress\u00a0can be made in the years ahead.

The Government has committed to\u00a0take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use\u00a0standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  I do accept that variable\u00a0rates remain above Euro area norms and I think that it clear that there is broad agreement in this House that we would like to see rates reduced.\u00a0Central Bank research on the influences on standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.<\/p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last week, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.  There has also been media speculation on the entry of another new mortgage provider into the market and the additional competition should help to put further pressure on the existing banks to reduce their rates.  This is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[10514\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to seek a break from the European Union regarding the fiscal rules in order to secure finance to address the emergency in housing and homelessness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>I do not intend to seek a break in the fiscal rules, which are designed to ensure\u00a0stable public finances that underpin sustainable economic growth.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are\u00a0provisions in the fiscal rules that are designed to promote public investment.  Within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the fiscal rules, capital investment in respect of capital formation is granted favourable treatment.  Thanks to capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public capital formation investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space\u00a0permitted\u00a0by the expenditure banchmark.  This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective or MTO\u00a0was loosened in the Stability Programme Update to 0.5% of GDP in structural terms.  As I have already communicated, this loosening will result in an additional &euro;1&frac12; billion in\u00a0fiscal space\u00a0becoming available under the EU rules once the MTO is reached.  Taking account of this development and capital smoothing, we will, as set out in the Programme for Government, be bringing forward proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital in the context of the mid-term capital review in 2017.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Having said that the Government is very conscious of the housing crisis and in this context Ireland's Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) have established a joint venture fund\u00a0Activate Capital which will invest in the development and construction of housing.  The venture will provide approximately &euro;500 million in financing for the housing sector.\u00a0 \u00a0By recycling this funding, the joint venture aims to develop 11,000 units over the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly\u00a0NAMA has stated that in accordance with its independent commercial mandate it will target the delivery of 20,000 additional residential units before the end of 2020. 90% of these residential units will be in the greater Dublin Area, where the demand for housing is greatest. Approximately 75% of these units will be houses, primarily starter homes.  The overall cost of the programme will be approximately &euro;4.5 Billion. NAMA will utilise its own cash resources to fund this necessary expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also outlined its commitment in the Programme for Government to accelerate the delivery of the &euro;3.8 billion Social Housing Strategy.  There will be a mid-term review of the Capital Programme in mid-2017\u00a0where\u00a0the allocation of additional exchequer capital investment to priorities will be determined.  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will set out the new Government Action Plan for Housing within the first 100 days. Once complete the action plan will be subject to target actions and specific deadlines. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, I wish to assure the Deputy that ending the Housing shortage\u00a0and Homelessness is a priority for this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[10918\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA02800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has held any discussions with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr David Cameron on its possible exit from the European Union; the effect this would have on the Irish economy, the United Kingdom economy and relations between the two jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I recently spoke with Prime Minister Cameron<b><\/b>by telephone on 6 May 2016, during which we discussed a number of matters, including the UK Referendum on EU Membership.

Moreover, and while it is desirable that such situations be resolved effectively, I also have to respect the fact that any unresolved matters arising could give rise to future legal proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  Under current law, and as previously conveyed to the person concerned, including in an e-mail reply from my Private Secretary in April 2014, it is not open to me as Minister, nor indeed to any member of the Government, to determine or to otherwise intervene in disputes or difficulties between practising solicitors and their clients or in relation to matters which are properly for determination by the Courts.  Rather, these are matters to be dealt with by the designated statutory bodies or, as may be the case, through the courts.  Pending the planned commencement this Autumn of the relevant provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, it remains a matter of law that the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (to which an aggrieved client may complain directly) and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator remain the statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors under the Solicitors Acts. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the current statutory complaints framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts.  As with any court proceedings, it would be considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications.  It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to their particular case. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, preparations are already underway for the establishment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers.  There will be a new framework to deal with complaints about alleged professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council that will apply from the date of its commencement.  This, in turn, will be backed up by the establishment of a new and independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both legal professions. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will, therefore, no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  This and other reforms being made under the 2015 Act will continue to be rolled out on a phased basis between now and the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800060#WRA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[10881\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for a D type long stay visa.","asker":"1225","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I am informed by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an application for a 'join family' visa from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on 19 April, 2016.

The Government has committed to\u00a0take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use\u00a0standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  I do accept that variable\u00a0mortgage rates remain above Euro area norms and I think that it clear that there is broad agreement in this House that we would like to see these rates reduced.  Central Bank research on the influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues. Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.<\/p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last week, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.  There has also been media speculation on the entry of another new mortgage provider into the market and the additional competition should help to put further pressure on the existing banks to reduce their rates.  This is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates.<\/p>  <p>   In relation to other charges, under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended), credit institutions must submit a notification to the Central Bank for approval if they wish to introduce any new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge, for certain services.  A notification made under Section 149 may include multiple charges and, having considered and robustly challenged the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria, the proposed charges may be rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the credit institution or approved in full.  Credit institutions are legally bound to comply with Letters of Direction, which set out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge for the relevant service.  Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion.<\/p>  <p>  My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at www.finance.gov.ie.  Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Smuggling","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[10723\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons the Revenue Commissioners prosecuted for the offence of tobacco and cigarette smuggling in the years 2015 and 2016 to-date; the number of prosecutions currently ongoing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that there were 40 convictions in respect of tobacco and cigarette smuggling in 2015.

Where such an individual is under the age of 75 at the time of exercising this option and does not meet the condition of having a minimum guaranteed pension income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, he or she is required to  set aside  an amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension fund if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum).  These funds are set aside by investing in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or by the purchase of an annuity.<\/p>  <p>  An AMRF owner has the option of using some, or all, of the funds in AMRF to purchase an annuity at any time prior to attaining the age of 75.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a  nest-egg  to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from 2015, an AMRF owner may draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the beneficial owner s discretion. <\/p>  <p>  In general, drawdowns from AMRFs (and ARFs) are subject to income tax, PRSI (up to age 66) and USC.<\/p>  <p>  The 4% annual draw down arrangement was introduced by Finance Act 2014 and replaced the facility that existed previously, whereby an AMRF owner could draw down the accrued income and gains of the AMRF (subject to tax) as and when they wished.  This change was prompted by a concern to give all AMRF owners access to a more certain level of annual income from their AMRF, rather than the uncertainty that dependence on investment performance had given rise to heretofore.  This is particularly important for those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the  trivial pension  rules, full commutation of a pension under an occupational pension scheme may take place if the aggregate benefits payable to an employee under the scheme (and any other scheme linked to the same employment) do not exceed the value of a pension of &euro;330 per annum.  This treatment is also available to holders of small retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs). <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that, as an alternative to the above, where, after taking the retirement lump sum, the remaining fund available to an individual for the provision of pension benefits is less than &euro;20,000, the Commissioners have no objection to the payment of a once-off pension.  The amount of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the &euro;20,000 limit, and this option applies equally to the holders of RACs and PRSAs. <\/p>  <p>  In effect, this means that those with relatively small pension pots at retirement who do not satisfy the guaranteed pension income condition required for ARF access, are not required to invest the pension pot in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with it, but can instead draw it down in full, subject to appropriate tax. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stability Programme Data","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[10839\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied regarding the stability of the economy with particular reference to possible negative external factors; if he has in mind any particular initiatives in the event of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p> The Stability Programme Update (SPU), published last month following its submission to the European Commission, sets out my Department's assessment of the economic outlook to 2021 together with a detailed assessment of risks.

Ireland's recovery is now firmly established and the Irish economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe - with growth of 7.8 per cent recorded in 2015.  In the\u00a0Stability Programme Update or SPU, published at the end of April,\u00a0my Department forecast that\u00a0the economy would\u00a0grow by 4.9 per cent in 2016,\u00a0by 3.9 per cent in 2017, and by 3.25 per cent on average over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Crucially, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2015 with consumption increasing by 3.5 per cent in 2015 and investment up by 28 per cent.  This is important as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth, with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015.  The competitiveness gains achieved since 2008 have been the result of productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that these gains are maintained through active policy management, to support continued growth through both foreign direct and indigenous investment.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now seen thirteen successive quarters of employment growth. Employment grew by 2.6 per cent in 2015, equivalent to 50,000 new jobs.  The monthly unemployment rate fell to 8.4 per cent in April, down from almost 10 per cent a year earlier.  The unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The positive outlook for Ireland's economic prospects is shared by the 3 major credit ratings agencies.  Following Moody's upgrade to an A rating, all 3 have now given an A-Grade to Ireland's sovereign debt.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the SPU highlights that there are several sources of uncertainty at present.  In particular, a more disruptive international environment could generate significant headwinds for the Irish economy. <\/p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, subject to a supportive external environment,\u00a0I am confident that the positive economic performance will be maintained over the medium term.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices.

From my perspective,\u00a0a number of measures have been implemented to help address the underlying problems, either directly by myself or by some of the agencies that come under the auspices of my Department.  One example is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) &euro;500 million joint venture (Activate Capital) to make funding available to the house building sector.

To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs from every sector have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the Small Firms Association, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Chambers Ireland to discuss issues around access to finance and these engagements help inform the development of policy on SME credit and lending. <\/p>  <p>  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending, including lending to the SME sector.  My Department collates and examines, on a monthly basis, granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector.  In addition, AIB and Bank of Ireland meet my officials, and those of the Credit Review Office, on a quarterly basis to keep them abreast of issues pertaining to the SME sector.  This facilitates the Department and the Credit Review Office in monitoring progress against agreed annual SME lending plans and ensuring that new lending to SMEs continues to increase as a percentage of total sanctioned lending.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the main policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than have recently been available on the Irish Market.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs. It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.\u00a0 Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the requirements for SMEs, the Department of Finance facilitates the biannual SME Credit Demand Survey.  The most recent survey, covering the period April-September 2015, shows that 85% of SME credit applications, excluding pending applications, were approved.  Working capital requirements were provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 48% of respondents stating that they required finance for working capital.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 63% of working capital coming from this source.  Further results from the survey can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  Results from October 2015 to March 2016 are expected shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 38.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB04050"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[10846\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800061#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that the lending sector continues to facilitate borrowers who have mortgage or other arrears and that arrangements continue to be entered into to facilitate their needs in a way that is sustainable to the borrower and not only to the lender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>This\u00a0Government is very committed to dealing with mortgage arrears and providing support for borrowers\u00a0that find themselves in that situation.

In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the borrower's current repayment capacity.  In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer.

The lender must also carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower.<\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA also requires lenders to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a lender, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.  The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his\/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.

To estimate of an overall likely cost, plausible projections would need to be generated for the potential uptake. In addition, to operate the proposal, Revenue would need landlords to provide a breakdown between rent received from residential and other types of property and between rent income arising from rent supplement and other sources of rental income.  Such a level of detail is not currently required in tax returns to Revenue.  It should also be noted that Finance Act 2015 increased mortgage interest relief to 100% for this cohort of landlord.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Abolishing USC on all new construction workers earning under &euro;40,000 per annum.<\/td><td>Department of Finance estimates that this would cost &euro;7.5m for every 5,000 workers earning &euro;40,000. Actual cost would depend on uptake and salary levels.<\/td><td>As an illustrative example for an individual at certain incomes, the average cost in terms of USC foregone under this proposal is as follows:<br \/><br \/>Gross Income &euro;20,000 (USC loss &euro;393)  - &euro;2.0m per 5,000 workers<br \/><br \/>Gross Income &euro;30,000 (USC loss &euro;943) - &euro;4.7m per 5,000 workers<br \/><br \/>Gross Income &euro;40,000 (USC loss &euro;1,493) - &euro;7.5m per 5,000 workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <br \/><br \/>It is important to note that the proposal would also impose a step effect of &euro;1,493 where income exceeds &euro;40,000.<br \/><br \/>This would be a State aid that requires the approval of the European Commission.  It should also be noted that a system treating groups of similar taxpayers differently for tax purposes would present administrative challenges for Revenue to police and may lead to distorted incentives. <br \/><br \/>It is not possible to accurately cost this proposal as the potential number of new construction workers is not available.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introducing an income tax exemption on income received from the alternative use of farmland for renewable projects, where such income is used for the purposes of re-investment in farm businesses<\/td><td>Aggregate costing requires further information<\/td><td>Additional information on the expected level of uptake and the total amount of income that would be exempted under this proposal would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost it.

Further information concerning the number of landlords who might avail of such a scheme, the level of  uptake by families and the types of income against which the credit could be used, would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.  The cost of the Local Authority payment of &euro;1,000 per annum towards maintenance also depends on the uptake.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introducing a Disability tax credit, similar to the Blind Persons tax credit. <\/td><td>&euro;172m (illustrative Rev.

Consequently 104,190 persons could be eligible for the new credit (assuming that those eligible for Blind Persons Credit could not additionally avail of the proposed disability credit). If all were to fully avail of a credit of &euro;1,650, the cost would be &euro;172m. However, it should be noted, while the Census 2011 shows 8,312 persons who are blind or have vision impairment, only 18.5% or 1,540 availed of the Blind Persons Credit in 2013 and this may indicate that not all cases may avail of a similar disability credit.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introducing a new housing scheme for people at risk of homelessness whereby landlords with unoccupied properties would be exempted from property tax , exempted from any income tax liable from the tenancy up to &euro;10,000 and given 100% mortgage interest relief <\/td><td>DoF illustrative estimate of &euro;45m for LPT element only, if it concerned 10% of LPT liable properties.<\/td><td>Further information on the likely uptake would be required to provide a potential cost.  However, for illustrative purposes regarding the LPT element only, if an assumption is made that 10% of LPT liable properties are vacant, with an average  LPT payment of &euro;241 applies, then the Department of Finance estimates that cost would be c.&euro;45m per annum based on analysis of CSO vacancy rates. This also assumes that all vacant properties would be rented rather than owner-occupied. It should also be noted that the 100% mortgage interest deduction introduced in Finance Act 2015 could benefit such landlords.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Reducing employer levies for rural town centre employers. <\/td><td>A 50% reduction in Employers PRSI (excluding NTF levy) would save relevant employers just over 5% on salary costs. Aggregate costing requires further information.<\/td><td>The Department of Finance has made an assumption that this proposal refers to Employers PRSI, which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection. In order to fully cost the proposals it would be necessary to identify the numbers of 'Rural town centre employers' and their associated employees along with individual salary levels and the level of reduction envisaged.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Expanding the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme to that investment in farm-scale renewable energy initiatives qualify. <\/td><td>Potentially already qualify\/ Costing of changes would require further information.<\/td><td>At present, the Department of Finance notes that renewable energy production by farmers who meet the qualifying conditions of EII are eligible under the scheme. It should be noted that the relevant trade must be undertaken by a company that meets the qualifying conditions regarding age and connection to the grid.  Should the proposal involve changing those conditions, additional information concerning the level of investments would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introducing a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate town centres throughout Ireland.<\/td><td>DoF estimates that, if all towns qualify, the potential cost could be greater than &euro;100 m. Aggregate Costing Requires further information.<\/td><td>The Living City Initiative was estimated to cost &euro;20m in respect of 6 cities. Its expansion to towns throughout Ireland would be likely to cost significantly more. Additional information in relation to the potential investments in the regeneration of qualifying towns would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Extending the SEAI accelerated capital allowances for investment in energy efficient equipment to sole traders. <\/td><td>DoF: Cost of circa. &euro;1m.<\/td><td>The current scheme costs in the region of &euro;350,000 per annum. Assuming that an equivalent number of sole traders were to avail of it, the additional cost could be approximately &euro;1 million per annum. This would be a cashflow cost. Additional information on the level of investments made by sole traders in the relevant energy efficient equipment would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Extending the Rent a room relief to cover lodger agreements where the licensees are providing a room in their primary private residence for a tenant who is homeless, (as defined by the Housing Act 1988 Section 2) or a refugee. The licensees would be exempted from any income tax arising from the solidarity lodging scheme up to &euro;14,000 per annum.<\/td><td>DoF Assumption: - less than &euro;0.4 million<\/td><td>At present, there is no restriction barring the taking in of tenants who are homeless or refugees. It is assumed that this proposal would provide for a different cap on the rent-a-room relief for certain tenants. Increasing the cap on the rent-a-room relief from &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 for all applicants in Budget 2015 was estimated to cost &euro;0.4m in a full year, so it could be expected that the cost would be less than that, if uptake were unchanged. Additional information concerning the potential number of landlords who might avail of such a scheme or what amount of income tax would become exempt under the proposal, along with an estimate of the potential uptake of this scheme by those defined under the Housing Act 1988 Section 2, would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Develop a voluntary PRSI Scheme for the self-employed<\/td><td><\/td><td>There are differences in the PRSI treatment of the self-employed as compared to employees.  <br \/><br \/>The self-employed pay Class S PRSI which generates the same entitlement to the State Pension as an employee&rsquo;s Class A contributions, but does not provide access to certain other benefits such as Jobseekers Benefit or Illness Benefit.  <br \/><br \/>Both cohorts pay 4% PRSI in their own right, but in the case of employees a further employer&rsquo;s PRSI charge of 8.5% or 10.75% is also payable, resulting in a significantly higher contribution to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of an employee&rsquo;s earnings.<br \/><br \/>Ways to further extend the PRSI system on a voluntary basis can be examined (but care will be needed to ensure that costs are manageable).<br \/><br \/>Costing of options for such a scheme would need to be completed by the Department of Social Protection.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Equalise the tax treatment of the self-employed.<\/td><td>To increase the earned income credit from &euro;550 to &euro;1,650 to match the PAYE credit would cost &euro;123 million.<br \/><br \/>To abolish the 3% surcharge on self-assessed income in excess of &euro;100,000 for the self-employed would <i>cost<\/i> &euro;144 million.<br \/><br \/>Or<br \/><br \/>To extend the 3% surcharge to PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000 would <i>yield<\/i> &euro;108 million.<\/td><td>Full equalisation of the tax treatment of the self-assessed and the employed would require a review of the expenses regime, as that available to the self-employed is more beneficial than that available to employees. In addition, the self-employed can also have significant timing advantages with regard to the payment of income tax liabilities, depending on the accounting year chosen. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A tax credit worth &euro;2,000 for average income households to help them deal with childcare costs. Low income households to benefit up to &euro;5,000.<\/td><td>Tentative costings, depending on take-up and eligibility considerations, indicate that such a tax credit could cost in the range of &euro;290m. to &euro;590m. per annum. The specific proposal, as outlined, would be likely to cost at the upper end of the range above.<\/td><td>The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland was recently published, which considered future policy options for increasing the quality, accessibility and affordability of early years and school age (out of school) care and education services. The group did not recommend the introduction of a childcare tax credit.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>The benefit of such a credit would be unlikely to accrue to parents and would be more likely to be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br \/><br \/>Tentative costings, depending on take-up and eligibility considerations, indicate that such a tax credit could cost in the range of &euro;290 million to &euro;590 million per annum.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Approximate costing for a tax credit for people at work equivalent to the blind tax credit.<\/td><td>If intended to be a <i>disability tax credit<\/i>, then the potential cots estimated by the Revenue Commissioners is &euro;172m.

The Department of Finance estimates that each &euro;10m of additional LPT will increase the cost per household by &euro;5 on average.                                                                                                                                               So, for example, &euro;50m in foregone development levies would increase LPT by &euro;25 per household and &euro;200m would increase LPT by &euro;100 per household.

The cost to the Exchequer of the reduced rate of 9% VAT for new build residential construction is estimated by Revenue to be in the region of &euro;205m in 2016. New residential completions are forecast to gradually increase to match the medium-term demand of 25,000 units by 2020. Therefore, the cost of providing a reduced rate of VAT for residential construction could be more than &euro;400m by 2020.

Staff assigned to NAMA are also subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1963.

NAMA informed the Garda&iacute; and the Data Protection Commissioner of their concerns and the matter was brought to my attention at the time.

First, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland as soon as possible, and, second, to provide every possible consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.<\/p>  <p>  The Egyptian Government is fully aware of the priority the Irish Government attaches to the welfare and interests of our citizen.  There has been sustained engagement at all levels with the Egyptian authorities.  I have been in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry, and the Taoiseach has twice met with President el-Sisi, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this dialogue with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with European and international partners and with the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Government representatives have worked with this citizen&rsquo;s legal team in Egypt and supported petitions to the court when asked to do so, including providing formal Government support for an application under Decree 140 and an application for release on bail.

This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties to support the de-congregation process.  In addition, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m  from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people and disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post primary school settings.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the issue he raised.

It is up to those two parties to reach a resolution with each other.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that any intervention by me, or indeed others without a legal function or role in this dispute, is not helpful.  The State has industrial relations institutions which are ready to assist the relevant parties in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am clear however that whatever resolution is arrived at between Transdev and its employees must be delivered within the overall contractual framework Transdev has with the State.  There cannot be, and there will not be, any change to that contract which runs until November 2019. I will not be opening the chequebook on behalf of the taxpayer in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  My focus is to protect the interests of the travelling public, and to encourage the parties to work to resolve their differences.  Any agreement must deliver sustainable wage rates that don't involve higher fares for the travelling public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800069#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[10829\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051800069#WRK04700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has considered availing of section 38 of the 1990 Industrial relations Act to enable her invoke the services of the Labour Court or the services of other persons in order to resolve the industrial dispute (details supplied) as an issue of huge public interest; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>This dispute between employees of Transdev, represented by SIPTU, and their employer has been both difficult and protracted.
