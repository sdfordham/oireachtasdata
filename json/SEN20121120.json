I ask that the Leader expedite matters in the context of holding a debate on the expert group's report in the Seanad in order that we might reach a clear Government decision on the need to legislate.  On the latter, there has been some discussion with regard to the passing of secondary legislation or guidelines.  From any objective legal analysis, it is very clear that secondary legislation would be subject to legal challenge unless it were introduced under the authority of an item of primary legislation.  Such primary legislation does not currently exist.  Even if the detailed criteria for doctors in cases such as that of Ms Halappanavar are set out in secondary legislation or are the subject of ministerial order, primary legislation will still be required.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of the tragic death that occurred in Galway University Hospital, I am extremely concerned with regard to the composition of the inquiry team.  Savita's husband, Praveen, has also expressed his concern in this regard.  He is quite right.  The current make-up of the inquiry team is not legally robust.  Including three members of staff from Galway University Hospital clearly breaches the legal principle of <i>nemo iudex in causa sua<\/i>, namely, the rule against bias.  Experts from the hospital should not be included on the inquiry team.<\/p> <p>Their input could be much more robust as witnesses rather than as members of an inquiry panel who might well be compromised in any litigation.  The inquiry must be conducted expeditiously.  It seems far too long to suggest that it would take three months.  It is clear that there is a need for the Government to move on legislation in the immediate meantime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000004#C04800","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353422700,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 14, the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2012 be taken before No. 1 today.

It seems to me that we must find a solution to the horror and terror that is being inflicted in that part of the world.  I am sure that it is possible for a country such as this to have an input into the solution.  Talks are ongoing in Egypt at the moment and it is hoped to reach a ceasefire, but I am not sure what stage the talks are at currently.  It is clear from what it is happening in the Middle East that we could do with having a discussion on it.

We have debated the matter previously but there is so much evidence that the Garda or whoever is in charge \u2013 there is a doubt as to whether the drugs squad or the Garda should be tackling the issue \u2013 believe that the penalties suffered by those who are caught smuggling are not in any way commensurate with what is needed.  This is a serious problem.  I gather that if one goes down Moore Street at the moment almost every second stand has someone selling cigarettes.  I gather that cigarettes are sold house-to-house also.  The cigarettes are not just smuggled, they are counterfeit.  We must take the necessary steps to tackle the issue.  Other smuggling is taking place as well but that one needs attention.  The Garda have scanners that enable it to identify smuggled cigarettes but only two scanners are available.  Investment in a scanner that would identify the location of smuggled tobacco would be worthwhile.

It is not for me to say whether it is correct or appropriate that taxpayers\u2019 money would be spent on funding such a programme but every now and then it is probably a good idea to have a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on standards in the media.  There is a school of thought that maintains that such dramas are appropriate because they reflect life in the cities of this country.  Others believe that teenagers aged from 12 to 15 are still up after the &quot;Nine O'Clock News&quot; and watch such programmes and will be influenced by them.  There is a fine line to be drawn.  I accept it is difficult to strike a balance.  The programme could serve the purpose of precipitating a debate on such an issue and for us to try to establish what is appropriate.  While I commend those in RTE, who by and large do a good job, it is appropriate that we would have a debate on media standards in particular in drama.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000005#D00500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1353422700,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Like Senator Quinn I wish to raise the current conflict in Gaza.

The behaviour of the Israeli government in recent years indicates a kind of malign triumph for Christendom.  After 20 centuries of persecution of the Jews, we have managed to drag them down to our own barbaric level.  I find it absolutely disgusting.  Yesterday one entire family was wiped out.  Eleven people were killed, nine of them representing four generations of one family.  The Israeli spokesperson described this as a technical error.  That has sinister resonances of previous regimes which used this kind of dehumanised language about people.  It should not come as any surprise, however.  This happened before in Operation Cast Lead, as Israel described it, in which rocket fire had virtually stopped before its actions provoked it again.  Mr. Jabari was actually in negotiations with the Israeli authorities when they launched their strike against the people of Gaza who were imprisoned in a ghetto from which they could not escape.  My colleague Senator Leyden is right in saying the Americans provided the hardware.  Should we be surprised?<\/p> <p>The Americans used drones.  I have a question for our friends, the Americans, and our friends in Israel.  What has happened to judicial process?  What has happened to the right to a trial before a life is snuffed out as a result of a decision taken in a secret and private room?  There is a double standard, as there was at 9\/11 when it was shocking and tragic that 3,000 people were killed.  However, what about the hundreds of thousands who were killed in Asia during the Vietnam war?  What about the people in Iraq?  Are they not human?  Do they not bleed as well?  Do they not breathe the same air as us?  Are their lives not as valuable?  I stand in solidarity with Tr\u00f3caire and Christian Aid, who are doing what they are supposed to do.  They are witnesses to the barbarity; they are speaking about it.  We neglect this and we cover it over.  We conceal and ignore it at their peril.  We should beware.  The Israelis have a highly sophisticated disinformation service that clearly reaches into the heart of many states, not just the United States but into this State, this Republic of Ireland as well.  All people of good conscience, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, atheist, should stand up for human rights - not Israeli, not Palestinian - but human rights.<\/p><p>I was honoured to be in the company of Mr. Gerald Kaufman, a distinguished British-Jewish parliamentarian.

There is no doubt that they could probably play a vital role as expert witnesses in any investigation, but it is wholly inappropriate to have an investigative body that includes those who are effectively members of the same team.

There are proposals to change how commonage is catered for.  This is completely discriminatory in terms of how the Government envisages taking it forward.<\/p> <p>There are other issues of concern in terms of a prioritising of those with larger holdings, who have scale and fertility in the context of what they can produce, rather than those with smaller holdings throughout the country.

The principle that justice must not just be done, but be seen to be done, applies to any kind of inquiry in the public interest.  Today I wonder whether the reset button will have to be pressed on this inquiry.  It is not just about the Galway membership of the inquiry team but from the chairperson down, anyone who has been known, or seen, to be involved in any advocacy on any side of this issue, given how fite fuaite it has become with the issue of abortion, should not be involved.  Such involvement would lessen my confidence in the impartiality of the inquiry.  There may be issues to be examined across the board and not just regarding the Galway membership of the inquiry team.  I have concerns at this point.<\/p><p>It is tragic because it is quite clear that we must await the outcome of the inquiry into what happened to the late Savita Halappanavar before we can have any credible or coherent debate about the issue of abortion.

That is why I am particularly disappointed that Sinn F\u00e9in has chosen to make the running by seeking legislation for the X case at this point when it is quite clear from the utterances of spokespeople from that party that they have not considered, or do not seem to know, the precise implications of that case.

While nobody should condone the violence and loss of innocent lives in Israel and the Gaza Strip, I hope the ongoing discussions, with Egypt acting as an honest broker, will reach a satisfactory conclusion so that the conflict can end.  According to news reports a Hamas spokesman indicated that 80% of an agreement had been reached.  It is always the remaining 20% that proves problematic but the eyes of the world are watching for what Israel is going to do next.  I hope common sense will prevail because, whatever sympathy Israel may have engendered as a result of the thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately at it over the past several days, some of which have reached the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, there is at least some semblance of discipline in the context of what the Israelis say they are trying to do.<\/p><p>One cannot condone yesterday's incident in which a police station was supposed to be targeted but which instead resulted in horrendous loss of life with an entire family being wiped out.

We all share the widespread concern about the ongoing exchanges of fire into and from Gaza.  In a statement issued on 15 November the T\u00e1naiste made the Government's position clear.  He called on both sides to avoid an escalation of hostilities and refrain from further attacks.  Yesterday, Monday, 19 November, he discussed the situation in Gaza with his EU partners at the GAERC Council meeting in Brussels.  The Council made a similar strong call for a de-escalation and restraint on all sides.  Much attention has focused on the casualties caused by Israeli air strikes and the use of heavy weapons in the crowded and built up area of Gaza.  It is essential that the exchanges of fire stop on both sides.  We simply cannot ask one side to stop.  Intensive efforts are under way on the part of Egypt and others to communicate with both sides to bring about a ceasefire to restore a sense of security for the ordinary people of Gaza and Israel.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, is in the region where he is due to visit Israel and the Palestinian Territories today.  As I mentioned, EU Foreign Ministers discussed the issue at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday.  Ireland has already stated it is disposed to supporting a balanced and reasonable resolution of the issue which this House has been to the forefront in highlighting on many occasions.  I will endeavour to arrange for the T\u00e1naiste or the Minister of State to come to the House to discuss it as soon as possible, I hope this week if that can be arranged.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn also raised the issue of penalties for smuggling not being adequate and the need for more resources for the Garda and the Customs service.  I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address these matters.  I agree with the Senator that the penalties are insufficient.  <\/p><p>Senator Martin Conway and several others mentioned the television drama programme &quot;Love\/Hate&quot; which is broadcast on Sunday nights and called for a debate on media standards in drama programmes.<\/p> <p>The programme referred to is certainly shockingly violent, but it is clear when one reads newspaper articles written by people who were in the police force for many years that it is indicative, unfortunately, of what is going on in many areas of this city.  I will see what I can do to get somebody in to discuss this question.  While it is shockingly violent, as I have said, I think it is an excellent production by Irish people, who are to be commended.

I share the concerns expressed by Senator Crown about the composition of the panel in question.

I can inform the House that the Minister's office has confirmed that the three consultants who were previously named will not now be part of the inquiry.

I need not inform Senators that the background to its introduction lay in the sheer economic mayhem that impacted upon employment in recent years.  In the space of three years some 16% of jobs in this country were simply wiped out.  The tragedy is that the vast majority of these related to young people who are under the age of 30.  While we know that we must consolidate the position with regard to the banks and our public finances, the main purpose of the work we are doing is to fix people's lives.  In that context, the most important consideration is getting them back to work.  It was for this reason that the Taoiseach decided - I am a key player in this regard - to put in place an action plan for jobs which seeks to span the entire Government.  In other words, it involves bringing the expertise of all Government Departments to bear on the challenge relating to employment.  This is not just an issue for one or two Departments - every Department has an role to play.<\/p><p>The second purpose of the action plan is to bring a sense of implementation and action to the orientation of Government in respect of this matter.  Learned reports have been compiled over many years in respect of the need to reform the health service and our system of public administration.  However, a large number of such reports are usually left on the shelf.  When one reflects on them years after their publication, one can see that very little has been done.  The opposite is the position with regard to the action plan, the purpose of which has been to ensure that actions which would make it easier to create employment would be taken within 12 months of publication.  That is what has driven our work in this regard.  Quarterly targets were set down and had to be met.  By and large, this has happened.  For example, the completion rate for the first and second quarters was 95%.  The rate for the third quarter was somewhat lower.  Anything that was missed in the first two quarters, however, has been delivered in the third and fourth quarters.<\/p><p>Setting deadlines is a new concept within the public service.  I cannot recall many policy initiatives which imposed deadlines for implementation on the system.  The laying down of targets and deadlines has had an impact.  In practical terms, we have brought forward things which many people had sought but which had been long delayed.  I refer, for example, to the microfinance initiative and the loan guarantee scheme and the establishment of the first-time exporters division.  We have, through ConnectIreland, reached out to the diaspora and others who are friends of this country in order to supplement the admirable work done by IDA Ireland.  We are beginning to see the impact of this.  Our problems have not been solved but last year was the best for international investment in a decade.  IDA Ireland delivered its best figures for employment in some time, with a net expansion of almost 6,000 in the number of jobs.  The gross figures in this regard were very positive.<\/p> <p>Enterprise Ireland saw two years of very strong double-digit export growth, as Irish companies have built on improved competitiveness and won back markets.  We are seeing a transformation occurring in the economy.  We are seeing the new sectors that will build our long-term economic future emerge.  We are seeing a hugely strong performance in export-oriented sectors, not just the ones under my remit but also tourism, to be fair, is doing well, having been very weak.  In net terms, in the three years before we were in government those export-oriented sectors lost approximately 70,000 jobs, and they have gained 20,000 jobs in the past 18 months.  In terms of those key sectors which are critical to our long-term future, they have turned a dramatic corner.  Overall, private sector employment continues to fall but it is pretty much plateauing at this point.  The strong growth in the export-oriented sectors is being weighed down by losses in traditional sectors.  Construction continues to lose employment, as does retail, although not as rapidly as was the case.  Domestic banking continues to go through a difficult correction.<\/p><p>There are grounds for stating that the strategy is working.  We have a balance of payments surplus, which means that as a country we are paying down our debt.  However, there is a huge distance to go.  Most Members who are in business will be aware that fixing the banks is not a question of just recapitalising them.  They became re-oriented away from the challenge of a small open economy, businesses and exporting and they got into the business of property and selling on commission.  There is a big challenge in re-orienting them away from that world to the new economy we must build.  The measures we have introduced will be useful but we need the banks to correct themselves also.<\/p><p>The Credit Review Office is doing great work.  I do not know whether Senators are using that office but it is a valuable tool.  If they come across people who are having problems with getting loan approval from their bank they should use that office because it has turned over more than 50% of the cases that have been brought to its attention.  Currently, up to 60% of the cases that come for adjudication are turned over.  Much useful work is done before the cases ever come to adjudication.  It is a really useful office that is making an impact.  To be fair, it was established by the previous Government.  I am not being partisan about the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000017#Q00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353428100,"counter":241,"content":"<p>That is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000018#R00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1353428100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>It is a useful office and its impact continues to be important because the banking system is not fixed.<\/p><p>What is strong in the action plan for jobs is that we have looked to other sectors.  For instance, the health sector set up a health innovation hub to examine how it could bring in innovative companies to get their first sales within the Irish health system which would then be a reference sale for them to export.  We have set that up on a pilot basis in Cork.  It already has six very strong projects being test-bedded within the Irish health system which gives them a reference sale.  I could go through numerous examples of other areas where other Departments, not with any remit directly related to jobs have become partners in trying to create an environment that is more friendly to job creation.<\/p><p>It is clear that a significant amount remains to be done.  Action plan 2013 is now in preparation.  I would welcome submissions and ideas from Senators.  We have had a consultation period which started towards the end of the summer.  I met with a lot of groups and we also received many individual submissions.  Much of the work from last year will carry on, for example, the audit of licences, which was conducted as part of last year\u2019s action plan for jobs.  The result of the audit will shortly be available.  That material will be important in deciding whether we can simplify regulation, which is a theme that is very much on the lips of those involved in the small business sector.<\/p><p>We can report good progress in what we are doing but it is a work in progress and there is a long way to go, as anyone who views the Irish economy is aware.  There are headwinds coming against us with the downgrade of growth prospects in all of our trading partners.  That does create difficulties for exporting companies.  Equally - I have been on 12 trade missions at this stage \u2013 one can sense that our companies are much more competitive and are in a more innovative space.<\/p> <p>They can win markets in places such as Japan, Canada and China.  We are seeking to open up new markets.  <\/p><p>I welcome the input and comments of Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000018#R00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353428700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Thank you Minister.

On 8 November we were addressed by a Nobel laureate, Professor Christopher Pissarides, who raised some very important points on youth unemployment.<\/p><p>  Professor Pissarides expressed concern that one third of young workers in Ireland are unemployed.  He urged us to address the situation urgently to avoid a lost generation which will prompt negative implications for economic growth and employment for many years to come.  His point is that job creation is the best help that unemployed persons, young or old, can receive during a recession.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the Minister is doing his best, but the problem is immense.  The CSO figures show that unemployment is still at 14.8% and long-term unemployment has increased to 8.8%.  A further point made by Professor Pissarides, with which I wholeheartedly agree, is the need for young people to secure a role in a line of work in which they are interested.  I have just come from the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, where I made this point.  A person derives pleasure from studying and having a career in a subject in which he or she is interested.  I think it is a gift from God to have an opportunity to study what one is good at and to develop one's potential, which is all important.  Having a job as a result of it is what it is all about.  The best labour markets enable young workers to experiment in different jobs, which helps them discover their true potential and ultimately thrive in that role.<\/p><p>  Two recently published articles in the newspapers highlighted the prevalent problems that are directly linked to youth unemployment.  The first article reveals that the number of workers, including IT specialists, hired from outside the EU has risen to almost 2,300.  This is a further indicator of how important it is to identify specific current and future skills that are relevant to areas of the economy if we are to assemble an appropriate skilled workforce for the future.  The number of work permits granted by Google Ireland rose from 49 in 2006 to an alarming 148 last year.  Facebook has the same problem.  It is fine that we have diversity and people from abroad coming to work in Irish companies but we want to get jobs for our own people.  The Nobel laureate stressed in his response that the EU is encouraging people to move to other countries if they cannot get a job in their own country.  Our effort should be directed at providing opportunities for people in their own country.  We know that many people want to go abroad.  Members of my own family want to go abroad and travel.  That is natural, but at the same time a true judgment of our own country is that we can provide jobs for people who want to stay here.<\/p><p>  In response to criticism regarding PayPal's recruitment strategy, the head of PayPal, Louise Phelan, was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>calling for people to &quot;get past&quot; the high number of people from overseas on her staff.  I agree with her.  We may be attracting the major multinational corporations to Ireland, but they are certainly looking abroad for appropriately skilled personnel to fill their vacancies. <\/p><p>  We had a presentation from the Forf\u00e1s expert group on future skills needs and our attention was drawn to an analysis carried out in 2011 of the job vacancies over the previous 12 months.<\/p> <p>There are approximately 8,500 job vacancies in sectors such as ICT, engineering and utilities, accountancy and finance, production manufacturing and materials.  There is something radically wrong in the mismatch when at the same time so many people are unemployed.  I refer to an excellent presentation from the presidents of DIT, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Cork Institute of Technology and the HEA which Senator Clune and I attended.  They are to be congratulated on their tremendous work in educating young people for the economy.  I know the Minister is completely committed to this policy.  However, any mismatch of skills should be rectified urgently by a change in policy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000019#S00300","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353429000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We have discussed the action plan for jobs on previous occasions.  The plan has set targets.  Quarterly and six-monthly reports have been issued which have been effective in measuring progress.  There has been an emphasis in this House on the need to support small businesses.  I welcome the changes such as the establishment of the local enterprise offices.  These will include a one-stop shop to provide support for existing and new businesses.  The expertise provided by local authorities and Enterprise Ireland will be important supports.  Small and medium indigenous enterprises are the backbone of the economy.  The action plan for jobs was established against the background of a significant loss of employment over the past years.  The unemployment rate is currently 14.8%.  The retail sector has suffered because people have less money in their pockets.<\/p><p>I note that the Digital Hub Development Agency focused on the online opportunities for Irish retailers.  Consumers spend in the region of \u20ac4 billion on online purchases but 75% of that money goes out of the country.  The retail sector is changing because people's shopping habits have changed.  The online marketplace needs to be taken seriously by Irish retailers.  The retail sector survives by changing to keep up with changing markets and consumer habits and needs.  For example, a traditional shoe shop in Cork closed down because it was not offering the product or type of service that consumers wanted.  By contrast, 20 yards down the street, a bright, modern shop is offering that shoes can be sent in the post within a week.  Shoes can be ordered online and the shop will deliver them.  That is the kind of service which customers expect.<\/p> <p>Retail can do better and the online sector can be exploited by Irish businesses.  The Digital Hub Development Agency report produced in the summer estimated that Irish people will spend \u20ac20 billion online each year, and most of that will be on sites outside the country.  The message for retailers from that is that if they can develop some sort of Internet presence there is a massive opportunity for them to capitalise on the online shopping trend that will undoubtedly grow.<\/p><p>The gaming sector is another area identified in the action plan and one on which we had a report produced last week on the way it is expanding.  There are now 83 companies in the gaming sector in Ireland; there were only 21 in 2009.  There has been a surge in the creation of indigenous jobs and the development of new businesses in this area, and it is an industry that is worth approximately \u20ac2 billion.  As the Minister said, it is about changing the emphasis in terms of the type and location of jobs and that is one sector, and the health sector, he mentioned.<\/p><p>As Senator White stated, the job opportunities and skills shortages in the IT area is an issue we have discussed in the enterprise committee of which we are both members.  We just had a meeting with the representatives of the Higher Education Authority, the universities and the institutes of technology.  We were discussing the ICT action plan and it was encouraging to hear that the conversion programme has expanded.  We are in the middle of a course whereby graduates can convert to the ICT area and, based on the success of that programme, an expansion of the courses available was announced last week.  We look forward to the results of that programme and all the indications are that those who graduate from that conversion course early next year will find employment.  That is a welcome development.<\/p><p>The food and drink sector and the need to focus on the type of skills that are required in that industry have been discussed.  A 2009 Forf\u00e1s report by the expert group on future skills needs identified particular skills shortages and recommended that a joint initiative between the third level sector and industry be established, led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I understand from questions I asked that that has not happened yet but it may be something that will be very useful.  The link between the third level sector and the needs of industry arises frequently.  They are represented on the expert group on future skills needs but there appears to be a lack of engagement at the coalface.  <\/p><p>An issue that arises frequently in our committee is that employers and industry are not getting the skills they need.  That is not taking from the fact that education must be broader than pure skills but when we have an unemployment level of 14.8%, skills that are directly required by industry should be developed and would be very welcome.<\/p><p>In terms of the construction sector there are opportunities in the green energy area in refurbishing homes.  There are many ageing properties in the country and there is an untapped potential in that respect.  The construction sector is probably down at about 5% now when any economy should have a construction sector of the order of 9% to 10% but there is a potential in that area.  That raises the old chestnut about refurbishing and insulating old homes and so on but there is great potential in that area and we should continue to focus on it.<\/p><p>The area of languages should be examined.  There are job opportunities in that area but we do not have the necessary skills.<\/p> <p>I mentioned this morning on radio that the next EU budget will contain a substantial package for the Erasmus programme.  We need to leverage that money to ensure our students acquire the necessary skills.<\/p><p>The action plan on jobs was welcome, especially the milestones it contains against which we can measure progress.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000020#T00200","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353429600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Zappone.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister and I thank him for attending.  He is bathing in flattery but he has been doing the most amazing job for us all.  I agree with Senator White about his personal commitment and passion.  He must be exhausted from all the trade missions he has been on.  He has been proactive and innovative with the microfinance fund, the credit loan guarantee scheme and the action plan for jobs and through his close collaboration with the Minister for Social Protection on the jobs activation measure. <\/p><p>However, this brings me to the issue I wish to raise.  Will he collaborate further with the Minister because I am concerned about her mad, crazed proposal to transfer the cost of sick pay to employers?  Why do employers pay PRSI?  If a company has a sick pay scheme, logic and precedence dictates that absenteeism will increase if someone is out sick.  It will double the cost for a company such as mine because if someone is out sick, someone else has to be hired to do his or her job.  Business costs will increase and our competitiveness to win tenders against savage, aggressive competitors, mainly in Europe, will be dangerously eroded, potentially resulting in the loss of millions of euro worth of business.  While the Minister is collaborating with the Minister for Social Protection, will he pay a call on the Minister for Health to discuss the medical profession's blind nonchalance, which aids and abets the malingerers who take advantage of the easy sick pay certification system we operate in Ireland?  I am as passionate as the Minister and his Department about creating a fertile environment for all businesses to flourish in these troubled times but we cannot allow the sick pay proposal or any increase in PRSI to go through. <\/p><p>I acknowledge how well the Minister has done in attracting foreign direct investment.  These companies engage in due diligence as they consider where they will place their business globally.  The sick pay scheme will not do us any good in the eyes of foreign investors.  It is profoundly depressing that we are discussing an action that will prevent job creation, lead to job losses and make businesses less competitive.  More Members should be present because the businesses the Minister is supporting are, in turn, supporting the economy.  If we all went down the street now to meet retailers, they would say the scales are fragile and one little push will send them over the edge.  This proposal is a push too far and it will prevent companies from employing people in the future and it might even serve to put some of them out of business.  I  acknowledge the Minister for Social Protection needs to make savings but if she examines the business strategy of Ireland Inc. and the bigger picture, she will recognise that this will have drastic results in the future for small businesses.<\/p> <p>She says it will not affect small businesses.  Let us take a business like mine, a small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, with 120 employees and a turnover of just under \u20ac20 million.  I know for sure, having discussed the matter at length at management meetings and board level, that the proposed sick pay arrangements would have a disastrous effect on our company\u2019s competitiveness.  I am one of the great stories in the exports sector, as are many of my colleagues in the food industry.  It is not just the little retailer or the hairdresser but the Minister\u2019s clients who admire him who are concerned about how this proposal could affect them.  I implore him to collaborate with his ministerial colleague to ensure this arrangement is not implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000022#V00200","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353429900,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and his positive update on the Action Plan for Jobs.  One fact that I notice he has left out of his positive update relates to the job creation exchange he has had with Washington State, from where I come.  The Minister hosted the state's governor, Ms Christine Gregoire, in the summer and has been on a trade mission to Washington.  I compliment him on this work and the jobs that have resulted from these exchanges.  I hope he continues to operate in this way.<\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has implemented substantial reforms in public sector procurement since taking office.  We see reforms in public procurement in the centralisation of many of these functions in the National Procurement Service.  There are many benefits attached to this system, including savings to the Exchequer.  Are we fully utilising the job creation possibilities of this system, or are we pursuing a short-sighted cost-saving exercise?  For example, next summer mandatory contracts for stationery supplies for non-commercial public sector organisations will come on stream.  I have been approached recently by a school in Tallaght that falls into this category.  It is concerned that it will have to cease the purchase of stationery supplies from a local supplier from whom it has purchased its supplies for the past 18 years at competitive prices.  Instead, it will have to purchase stationery supplies from the company the National Procurement Service chooses.  The local supplier employs three people and I am one of his clients.  Their jobs may be at risk as a result of the introduction of centralised contracts.  The head of the Small Firms Association recently told the Oireachtas joint committee on jobs that many small and medium-sized enterprises were having difficulties under the new procurement system because a central procurement system tends to favour the larger business and much of the process is focused on price.  I am aware that the Department has several initiatives that focus on assisting SMEs in competing for contracts, including informing them how to submit tenders and breaking down contracts to make them more accessible.  However, a complementary approach could be taken by requiring procurers to make provision for social benefits when awarding contracts.  This is permitted under EU law and in place in many EU member states.  Deputy John Lyons has introduced a Bill on procurement that would require a percentage of tender assessments to consider the social benefits.  Many EU member states not only allow but require public procurers to take potential social benefits into account in a variety of circumstances.  According to European Commission research, over half of member states have references to the promotion of social responsibility in public procurement.  However, Ireland is not among them.<\/p><p>The National Procurement Service\u2019s annual survey made two recommendations on how the promotion of social benefits consideration could be improved.  First, it stated procurers should take into account factors that would contribute to the long-term sustainability of local economies when creating and awarding national contracts.  Second, there could be greater participation by social enterprises in delivering public services.  I have raised the issue of social enterprise with the Minister before when we were feeding into the Action Plan for Jobs.  I also note that the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, has ordered a detailed study from Forf\u00e1s of the actions required to be taken by the Government to create jobs in the social enterprise sector.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister comment on both of these issues?  What is the policy of the Government on national procurement and ensuring the sustainment of local economies?  Are policies heading in the direction of putting the three people in Tallaght to whom I referred out of business?  When will the study from Forf\u00e1s be completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000023#W00200","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353430200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to discuss the issue of job creation.  I imagine he agrees that eight minutes is not enough and that the Seanad and the D\u00e1il could speak about this issue for many days.  <\/p><p>There has been a good deal of positive news, albeit slowly.  However, we are moving in the right direction.  Sometimes the public believes jobs are not being created, as all we hear about is job losses, but in certain sectors there is job creation, which is good.  <\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's innovations, including Microfinance Ireland, the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, the development capital fund and the loan guarantee scheme.  Last week I met Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office and his staff to get their views on the progress of the office and how it was helping small business.  I agreed totally with him that its work was progressing well.  I am unsure whether he is of the same opinion of me, but when the economy starts to turn, it will not happen overnight; rather, there will be a gradual upturn and the banks must be ready for it.  They should not close doors when the times comes for them to re-finance businesses.  The Credit Review Office is doing tremendous work to face up to the problem where small and large companies are in trading difficulties.  It works alongside the county enterprise boards in this regard.  I call on all Members to encourage small start-up businesses to meet the county enterprise boards with their accountants before meeting the banks.  Mr. Trethowan is encouraging them to do this also.  In certain cases the Credit Review Office is not getting through, but this is not the fault of Mr. Trethowan; rather, it is the fault of accountancy bodies or the banks.  The more people use the Credit Review Office, the more credit that will flow.  We must get credit flowing.<\/p><p>At the weekend I was at the local cinema.  The cinema may be a barometer of the economy because everyone goes to the cinema, whether one is a millionaire or someone who simply seeks some entertainment at the weekend.  The manager commented that he had noticed how busy the cinema was.  However, in recent years, coming up to Christmas, as the budget was introduced demand dropped but then picked up again as people became more confident later in the following year.  If we provide confidence and certainty in the budget and do not suck any more money out of the economy, cinemas will prosper.  The cinema is the closest barometer I can offer for the economy without going into technical and fiscal quotations.<\/p><p>I welcome the loan guarantee scheme.  I read about the \u20ac250,000 female entrepreneur fund that was launched recently.  Will the Minister circulate the details of the fund?  Donegal County Council was represented at a conference held in Boston last week.  One of the themes was related to jobs promotion on both sides of the Atlantic for Irish people.  A group of female business people, Donegal people living in Boston, are keen to link up more with projects in County Donegal.  The fund mentioned would be an ideal source of funding for them.  Perhaps \u20ac250,000 may not be enough and we need more, but how the money is to be spent is a matter for the Department to consider.<\/p><p>Recently, I spoke to representatives of some small companies in the Donegal region who wanted to become involved in the health care business.  Some of them have ideas which I have sent to the Minister who has acknowledged them.  They want to become involved in the health care business and are relying on research and development, the funding for which must be increased.<\/p> <p>CoLab is located at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology and comprises a small group of companies working in software, advertising, innovation, small-scale manufacturing and other areas.  The companies are going global and are a microcosm for the economy at large and how we should develop.  These people are working with one desk and a chair but are getting results.  The research and development support they need should be more readily available.  <\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien spoke about the sickness benefit scheme that the Minister for Social Protection is considering introducing and I have asked business people in my own area how they feel about it.  The response was - and this is something I know to be true after 25 years in business - that in private business there are very few people who take long sickness breaks.  It is not because they are any fitter or healthier than others but because of the nature of private business.  Absenteeism is not really a problem in the private sector but it is in the public sector.  If the Government wants to make savings in that area, it should tell the public service managers to deliver the same efficiencies that exist in the private sector, where the rates of absenteeism are much lower.  Having done that, the Government may discover that it does not have to introduce any sickness benefit scheme.  All public service departments should be able to deliver better efficiencies because it is done in private business all of the time.  I can only speak from my own experience but I do not remember any of my staff being off sick for long periods of time.  Perhaps I was lucky with my staff but I believe that is the general consensus among business people.  I agree with Senator O'Brien's view up to a point but there is room for the public service to step up to the plate in this regard.  <\/p><p>I urge the Minister to be mindful in the budget of the fact that small and start-up businesses need cash in the economy and in peoples' pockets.  There is no point having a nice car without a supply of diesel or petrol.  We need cash in the economy so that people can go to the cinema, buy popcorn there, buy a burger on the way home and have an extra few euro to spend at the weekends.  That is what will make the economy move again and until that happens, the economy will continue to stagnate.  We have our own problems here but we also have our own solutions.  We have a great record on the export market and if we can bring that success and innovation to the domestic market we will come out of this crisis far quicker than other countries.  I thank the Minister for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000024#X00300","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353430500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is always a joy to listen to somebody with good news and certainly the Minister has brought good news today.  The Minister is also hearing great things today.  Even members of the Opposition are saying nice things about him.  It certainly appears that there is progress and that things are heading in the right direction.  We have become more competitive in recent years and because of that, we are making progress.  I was delighted to read an article in <i>The Economist<\/i> this week which said that &quot;Indicators of underlying competitiveness like unit labour costs have also turned in the right direction in most of the countries in trouble...Ireland has done the best, with a 14% improvement since 2008.&quot;  We are often accused of talking ourselves down but there is good news here and the Minister has brought some of it with him today.<\/p><p>  Having travelled around the country a lot recently, I have met some people who have talked themselves into bad news.  They are just pessimists but there are others who have talked themselves into good news.  It is so interesting to see some of the success stories.  I have been taking an interest in the retail sector more than others and there are great success stories in that sector.  I was in Malahide the other day and took a look at the new Avoca shop there.<\/p> <p>I do not know how many are employed but I estimate that approximately 100 people work in the shop.  It is doing some harm to Malahide because everybody who used to shop in the village is now going to Avoca.  A chain called Carraig Donn has opened its 21st store even though it only started business a few years ago.<\/p><p>These Irish companies are not looking for somebody else to do a job they can do themselves.  They are being innovative and the Government needs to be more innovative in its ideas.  Money can be made available from voluntary pension schemes if we encourage people to use part of their funds to free up their finances or invest in house extensions.  In 2009 Denmark allowed people to take a portion of their pension funds to cover immediate expenses rather than wait for retirement.  Approximately 94% of those who had pensions took out some of their money and the economy was stimulated to the extent that GDP jumped by 1.4%.  If we introduce a similar measure we might free up a portion of the estimated \u20ac100 million held in voluntary Irish savings to create confidence in the economy.  Germany deregulated self-employment and cut back unemployment benefit.  One may say that sounds like bad news but the intention was to encourage people to work more.  The unemployment rate has fallen almost every year since 2005.  Sometimes one must do uncomfortable things or take steps that may not be popular to create jobs.<\/p><p>We regard Sweden as a socialist and left-wing country but many changes have been introduced in that country.  State handouts have become less generous and it has become more difficult to qualify for them.  The Swedish Minister for Finance, Anders Borg, surprised himself when he introduced a tax cut on that basis.  Grocers know that they sometimes sell more and increase their profits by reducing their prices.  It is possible to do this if one is smart enough but governments have not thought this through over the years.  Sometimes we can take in more money by reducing the tax rate.  Further innovation is required in this area.  When Charlie McCreevy announced a reduction in the betting tax from 20% to 10%, there were howls that he was helping his friends in the horseracing business.  The following year he announced that as he took in more money at 10% than he did at 20%, he was going to reduce the rate to 5%.  There were more howls that he was helping his friends in the horseracing business but the following year he was able to announce that he took in even more money at 5%.<\/p><p>The Swedish Minister for Finance firmly believes that job creation and economic recovery start with entrepreneurs.  Although unpopular, he believed it was necessary to cut taxes for certain rich people.  He argued that in most cases a company would not be created without its owner.  There would be no Ikea without Ingvar Kamprad or a Tetra Pak without Ruben Rausing.  Both individuals moved out of Sweden.  Sinn F\u00e9in proposes a wealth tax, which is a sure way of losing a large number of people who would otherwise be willing to invest in Ireland.  A high wealth tax and an inheritance tax cause people to emigrate because it becomes too costly to own a company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000025#Y00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353430800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The Senator must be worried.

Entrepreneurs are a production factor.  These people are indeed rich and one can argue that we want to encourage social cohesion but it is also problematic if entrepreneurs are driven out of the country because they are the source of job creation.<\/p> <p> In terms of social protection, we must think of other innovative ways to get people back to work.  I have spent some time looking at what Sweden has been doing.  It introduced a credit for hiring household help.  This innovation was designed to spur demand for low wage workers.  We think of Sweden as a very liberal country, but it has now reformed its system so that union membership dues, in contrast, no longer qualify for tax relief.  Thus, Sweden is encouraging lower skilled people to work and is not ashamed to introduce measures such as a credit for household help.  This is something I had never considered.<\/p><p>In Belgium also one can claim a large part of the cost of household help.  We should consider some of these steps.  I believe local authorities in Denmark are responsible for ensuring the local availability of day care facilities, including child minding.  Childminders are supervised and often co-ordinated by the local authorities.  Back to Sweden, the combination of lower taxes and fewer benefits there is intended to encourage people to work.  The Swedish Minister for Finance says the new system is encouraging more people to take jobs and is the key, not only to faster growth, but also to keeping inequality very low.  The Minister for Finance there believes that in the long term, Sweden's reforms will raise the country's employment rate by 5%.  We seem to forget about this here.  We need to get people into any sort of employment.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien made a point about something that is threatening jobs, namely, the issue of sick pay payments.  She has made such a strong case that there is little need for me to touch on it.  However, I believe a huge amount can be done in that area.  If we turn a blind eye to the issue and allow what has been suggested to go ahead, we will create a huge gulf in job creation.  <\/p><p>I have a personal interest in the Construction Contracts Bill and cannot believe it has got stuck somewhere along the line.  The Bill was introduced two years ago and has gone through this House and has passed Second Stage in the other House.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is having great difficulty moving it on from wherever it is currently.  This is a Bill that will help create jobs.  Many jobs were lost when the State paid for big construction contracts, but where the contractor did not pay the subcontractors.  I believe we can do a lot on that and would love to see this Minister move on this and help the Minister of State get it off the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000026#Z00500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353431100,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  Everybody has been praising him here, but we who are in the same party tend to work him to the bone.<\/p><p>The budget is coming up soon and we are doing well in the export market, but we are not doing so well in the domestic economy.  Does the Minister have some job creation projects in mind to boost the domestic economy?  Senator White mentioned that we had the Nobel laureate economist, Professor Pissarides, here and he spoke about boosting the domestic economy through public investment projects.  For example, in the 1970s one such project was installation of central heating, but now such a project might concern the greening of public buildings.  Anything that will boost the domestic economy is welcome.  As the Minister knows, the construction sector is flat, as is the retail sector.  The Minister should consider this.  Aligned to this is the suggestion made by Senator Quinn to release pension funds.  I do not know if we have got a definitive response on this yet.  In these straitened times, we need to help people find more funds to invest in their local economies.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned a health innovation hub in Cork.  This will be useful.  I do not know what it will do, but I know that we need to look at the area of health and the potential for jobs.  A concept I have been looking at for some time is that of over-reliance, particularly by young people, on being employed.  This is a flaw in our education system.  We need to educate more for self-employment and for entrepreneurship.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.  I believe we need to run our children on twin tracks, both the academic track and the self-employment track.<\/p> <p>Has the Minister considered the concept of an entrepreneurship hub which would help our young people to turn their qualifications into job creating outlets?<\/p><p>I would like to support fully what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said about sick pay.  Job creation starts with entrepreneurs.  The Minister must not kill entrepreneurship.  We rely on entrepreneurs to create jobs.  I will not say much more on the issue because the time available to me is limited.  I fully support what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has said.  I have made this point to the Minister, Deputy Burton, previously.  We have to consider all of the stakeholders in sick pay - the State, the employer and the employee, who must take more responsibility for his or her health or sickness.<\/p><p>Some of the schemes of financial support for Irish businesses are wonderful.  Yesterday, I met a quantity surveyor who had been out of work since 2008, but in the last year has hired 15 people on various small construction jobs.  To take 15 people off the live register is a considerable achievement.  He did not know about any of these schemes.  His accountant did not inform him.  I believe the accountants of this country are not sufficiently well informed about schemes like the revenue job assist and seed capital schemes.<\/p><p>I will conclude by speaking about the need for flexibility in the labour market.  One of the things we learned from Professor Pissarides was that job subsidies which offer work experience are better than unconditional unemployment compensation.  Sweden has a successful scheme which subsidises the hiring of unemployed workers to replace those on maternity leave and other types of leave.  The authorities then pass the unemployment compensation to another unemployed person and pay a wage that is higher than the compensation.  National insurance contributions are paid by both the employer and the employee.  This form of subsidy is ultimately cheaper than supporting people on unemployment.  A similar scheme in Germany has also been successful.  I ask the Minister to work with the Minister, Deputy Burton, on this concept.  We need to give young unemployed people an opportunity to gain experience and feel purposeful, rather than sitting on their you-know-whats while getting unemployment benefit, which is not good for the State or the young person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000027#AA00200","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353431400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We sometimes suffer from groupthink in this House.  A great deal of positivity is being directed towards the Minister this afternoon.  Some positive things are happening.  I assume the Minister accepts the reality that we have a substantial job to do to create the jobs needed to reduce the current standardised rate of unemployment, which is 14.8%.  Over 300,000 jobs were created between the first quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of this year.  There has been a seismic shift in the whole economy of this State due to job losses, etc.  Obviously, the Minister is conscious of that.  He is not responsible for the mess he inherited, but he is responsible for trying to work through it.  Collectively, we all need to do our best to create jobs for the people of this State.  The Minister has my support in that regard.<\/p><p>Three big issues are facing the State in this regard.  First, we need an economic stimulus and a proper employment plan that creates the jobs we need.  Second, we need a fiscal strategy that is about fair budgets, as Senator Harte said, rather than taking money from people's pockets.  When we are framing our budgets, we have to be conscious of the impact of budgetary decisions on the domestic economy.  Third, we need a bank deal.  I do not believe we will create the jobs we need until we get these three interconnected pieces of the jigsaw right.  Sinn F\u00e9in has presented a real and detailed job stimulus strategy that would involve an investment of \u20ac13 billion in job creation and retention.  It would be funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the European Investment Bank and the private pensions sector.  I remind the Minister that innovative ideas are being proposed by Opposition parties, trade unions and business organisations.<\/p><p>I would like to make a point about regional disparities.  The Minister will accept that the south east, where I come from, has an added problem because it suffers from a high level of unemployment that is 5% above the national average.  There is a focus on short-term measures that will create as many jobs as possible in the short to medium term, but we also need to show some long-term thinking on the basis of where our economy came from over the last 30 to 40 years.<\/p> <p>The south east is a good example of a region which was over-dependent on manufacturing, where students left school early and people were not inclined to be innovators and entrepreneurs because they were able to take up employment in big factories such as Waterford Crystal, Bausch and Lomb, The Foundry and so on.  The entrepreneurial drive was non-existent because of an over-reliance on manufacturing.  However, that is now gone, leaving a whole swathe of people, aged between 30 and 50 years of age, with no jobs and needing to be reskilled, which is only one problem.  <\/p><p>Aside from the short-term immediate policy decisions which need to be made to create jobs now, we need to consider how we can foster a new culture of innovation among young people, in particular in areas which have under-performed, of which the south east is one.  I genuinely believe that this needs to be addressed at primary and second school level.  I have previously made the point to the Minister that in the case of the Young Scientist of the Year award, we need to be looking at incentives for the business sector which will encourage creativity, a thinking outside of the box and an entrepreneurial spirit.  We also need to ensure people see entrepreneurship as an opportunity and are encouraged to avail of it.  <\/p><p>The ground has shifted.  We are in a completely different situation because of the economic crisis.  Out of the ashes of any crisis comes opportunities.  Those opportunities will only be grasped in the long term if we ensure that we are genuinely fostering creativity at primary, second and third level and that people have equal opportunities to be entrepreneurs, thus creating the jobs we need.  I am asking the Minister to think long term as well as short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000028#BB00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353431700,"counter":267,"content":"<p>There are three speakers remaining, Senators Brennan, Barrett and Norris.

It is hoped no further tax will be imposed on this sector in the forthcoming budget.  This sector will in my opinion play a significant part in our economic recovery.<\/p><p>Many SMEs are devastated and vulnerable, with some totally broken.

It is always great to see him here.  I was involved in the Culliton report which provided previous Governments with advice on this problem.  As stated by the Minister, a great deal of progress has been made.  The Nobel prize winner in economics, Professor Pissarides, from Cyprus who spoke in this House recently was keen on flexible labour markets, internships and not giving young people money for doing nothing by having them stand in for staff on maternity leave.<\/p> <p>One of his themes is that something other than just the dole should be available for young people.  We will obtain a full copy of his speech and forward it to the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p>I accept that the reorientation of the banking system is necessary.  Between 1998 and 2008, the level of credit advanced by Irish credit institutions rose from \u20ac66 billion to \u20ac392 billion.  Only 1.9% of this went to either agriculture or industry.  I have tabled a measure in this regard to which I hope the Minister will give consideration.  I refer to the Mortgage Credit (Loans and Bonds) Bill 2012, which advocates that we should adopt a system of mortgage provision similar to that which obtains in Denmark.  If we can get Irish banks out of lending to those who wish to purchase homes - which still accounts for 75% of their business - and encourage them to lend to industry instead, this would provide a terrific boost.  Apparently, the Danes have pension funds which are willing to invest in mortgages.  I understand that at one point IDA Ireland had plans to bring the Danes into the IFSC.  If we moved to the model to which I refer, there would be a different way of financing housing and we could free up the money the Minister needs for the microfinance programme, etc.<\/p><p>There is also a need to reorient the education system, particularly in the context of languages and maths.  Too many language departments in Irish universities have been put under pressure.  As Senator Clune indicated, approximately 80% of maths teachers do not possess qualifications in maths.  This is not of assistance when there is a mismatch between the jobs being brought into the country and the qualifications of those who are unemployed.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is interested in changing the position in this regard.<\/p><p>On the efficiency of sheltered sectors and the McLoughlin report on local government, Limerick had twice as many local authority staff per head of population as south Dublin.  It is a good idea to amalgamate the authorities involved in this regard.  All the sheltered sectors must be addressed.

There is also a need to examine upward-only rent reviews and the practice of lobbying for tax breaks which do not result in jobs being created.<\/p><p>I have run out of time but I wish to state that those of us on this side of the House will support the Minister in respect of any action he proposes to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000029#CC00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353432000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I wish to strongly support my colleague and friend, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, who is an extraordinary example of someone who is an entrepreneur and who has created a significant business interest.  She and her husband used their entrepreneurial genius in order to launch the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation.  These are the people to whom we must listen.  They are not crazy, they have experience.<\/p><p>I have been approached by the organisation which represents small and medium-sized enterprises, ISME.  These enterprises, of which there are 9,000 or so, employ 250,000 people.  They already pay PRSI in respect of their employees and for replacement staff and they are now being whacked again.  Is there going to be a reduction in the PRSI they pay in order to compensate for this?<\/p><p>Sickness schemes help to create sickness.  On radio in recent days an employer recounted the story of meeting an employee who was out sick from work and who was returning from a skiing holiday.  I do not understand how a doctor could have examined someone who was in Switzerland.  The average number of sick days taken each year by people who work for small and medium-sized enterprises is three.  The figure for the public service is 12 or more.  I do not want to cause a breach between the public service and those in the private sector.  However, it is intended to whack those who are putting their own livelihoods on the line for the sake of their businesses.  These people get sweet damn all from the State if those businesses get into difficulties.  They have no insurance but they are obliged to pay it for others.  In 2011, 185,000 days were lost to sick leave in the Civil Service.  Some 72,000 of these relate to staff in the Department of Social Protection, where Deputy Burton is Minister.  That is extraordinary.  A total of 5,000 employees of the HSE call in sick every day.  This is not the case among those who work in what I refer to as the real world.<\/p><p>My final point relates to what will be the impact on cr\u00e8ches and child care facilities, which are already on the margins.  The Government is aware of the position in this regard.  Some 37% of child care facilities have indicated that they will be obliged to make staff redundant and a further 42% have stated that they will have to increase their fees.<\/p><p>There is a need to reconsider this matter.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is a fine individual.  The Minister before the House, Deputy Bruton, is also a fine individual but I do not have time to pay adequate tribute to his many qualities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000030#DD00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1353432000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The Senator definitely does not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000030#DD00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1353432000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>If we want to encourage industry and enterprise, then we should not kill them where they already exists by introducing particular measures.

The action of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, to double the output in the ICT area is an important response.  Senator Clune referred to conversion courses.  Equally, students and parents must take note.  At the start of this decade 9.5% of students did ICT courses.  By 2007 the percentage had dropped to approximately half the amount.  People voted with their feet to move their study away from the skills that drove an open economy into the skills that drove the property sector.  Unfortunately, it is not just the banks that collapsed; but our choice of career went astray.  That is an important issue.<\/p><p>Senator Clune made an important point, which is worth reiterating, that approximately 50% of businesses are online but less than half of those trade online.  That is shooting themselves in the foot.  The statistics show that companies that go online double their rate of turnover growth.  It is important to get people to switch.  The CEBs have been doing work in this area, as have companies such as Google.  More could be done.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is very interested in the issue.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Clune for her work on ICT skills.  Real issues arise in that regard.  She also spoke about other areas that are not as big as ICT but should be examined.  The plastics sector is giving out about lack of skills.  It is eminently possible to fill such positions.  We must build more connection between our industries and our educational institutes.  Dare I say, business must think a bit more long term.  We do not have the tradition, as they have in Germany, of traineeships, where people commit to provide places to bring on the next generation of expertise.  We need to see more of that approach.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O\u2019Brien raised the issue of sick pay.  I acknowledge that could be a problem.  Senator Harte referred to the much higher level of sickness in the public sector at approximately 5% compared with 2% in SMEs.  We must be careful about anything that would increase the cost of employment.  That said, there is a genuine issue in that we seem to have a very high level of long-term dependency under sickness headings on the social welfare system.  It is similar to people drifting into long-term unemployment.  We have a system where people drift into long-term sickness dependency.  We must think of other ways to deal with the issue.  Employers must consider how to bring such people back to the workplace rather than accepting that such people drift into receipt of invalidity pension.  That is a more important issue to be examined.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone raised procurement policy.  There is clearly a conflict between the need to get best value, which largely means centralised contracts and cheap price, and diversity of supply.  I accept we must find savings in procurement, which is the lowest hanging fruit.  There is no point in us paying 50% more for paper because we scatter it across thousands of contractors.  That is madness.  We must ensure that innovative companies get the opportunity to bid for business and that, as they do in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, we encourage innovative companies.  In the action plan we have a number of good models such as the ESB and several others which do not come to mind.  They work with innovative companies to get the first sale and get the company to have a reference sale and the ability to sell beyond that.  We can commit to such an approach.  We must engineer procurement to favour it but I do not think we will be able to say that there will be a stationery provider in every village in the country.  It does not make sense to cut front-line health care in order to support that level of inefficiency or waste.<\/p> <p>There are different pressures we have to accommodate.  Social enterprise comes under the action plan and will be delivered on before the end of the year.  There is scope for social criteria to be included in tenders, which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is examining.  Taking someone off the live register in the area where the contract is being awarded, for example, is legitimate under EU rules.  Some other points suggested that would favour local suppliers would not be legitimate.<\/p><p>Senator Harte raised the important issue of how small businesses prepare their credit requests for their banks.  The banks are at fault for the very high refusals for credit.  However, Mazars\u2019s and other studies show applications from small businesses are sometimes not just good enough.  They are also not using the appeals mechanism internally in the bank or in the Credit Review Office.  We need better support for small businesses to present their case well and be willing to pursue it after the first refusal.<\/p><p>The first competitive feasibility fund for female entrepreneurs, coming to \u20ac250,000, was oversubscribed.  We got 100 applications when we expected between 30 and 40.  We are offering another fund, coming to \u20ac500,000, which will close on 4 December.  Hopefully, it will be equally successful.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised the matter of voluntary pensions.  That issue is beyond my pay grade.  There was an incentive where voluntary pensions got a special dispensation in not paying tax to provide for long-term pensions.  There are issues as to what funds would be let out of this.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider.  In the past, I have noted the Revenue Commissioners being uneasy about this.  Senator Quinn also raised the point about a low-tax system for entrepreneurship.  Senator Healy Eames\u2019s brandishing of our little leaflet is our answer to that.  If people want to establish a company, they can get \u20ac600,000 from their previous PAYE tax to put into their company.  There are generous tax reliefs to get people to switch into entrepreneurship.  These are the sorts of incentives we need to create and get more take-up of them.  The truth is that only 70 people take up these schemes every year when the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, GEM, points out nearly 2,000 businesses are set up every month.  There seems to be some breakdown in communication which we are seeking to address by having this information available through the Companies Registration Office, county enterprise boards and local enterprise offices.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane and others asked if we could make big and bold public investments.  The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are trying to get public investment off the balance sheet.  A bold stroke is setting up funds for innovation, infrastructure and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, which are off the balance sheet and are renewable which can help to drive investment.  For example, these include using the capital from the national lottery to fund the national children\u2019s hospital and water charges for funding investment in the water system.  Those are the ways one drives investment when one is fiscally constrained.  We have to think smarter than just calling for big spending on public investment.<\/p><p>I support education for entrepreneurship in whatever way we can use it.  We will be using the local enterprise offices to promote it.  Revenue job assist is a generous subsidy to fill vacancies.  Again, maybe we can smarten up the ways these are oriented.  This is a double tax relief for three years against wages for the employer plus a tax relief for the employee taken on.  It is worth \u20ac30,000 to a sole trader to take on someone over three years who is long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>The sheltered sector is always with us.  Reforming the legal area and local government is very important.  However, I do not believe we are at the end of this.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000031#EE00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ninth Report of the Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1353432900,"count":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000032#FF00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1353432900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The Committee of Selection reports that it has discharged Senator Susan O\u2019Keeffe from membership of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at her own request and has appointed Senator Aideen Hayden in substitution for her.

The aim is to avoid the plan becoming a box-ticking exercise.  If we are to run the economy by rules, we should include rules which would ensure our economic policies were designed to reduce poverty or create jobs.  Any such plan should be realistic and any plan which did not take these goals into account would be doomed to fail.  The current plan just includes compliance with the budgetary rules, with annual targets for the size and nature of revenue and expenditure measures to be taken and how they relate to different sectors.  While this is required to meet the rules under the treaty, it does not negate or rule out the possibility of including in the plan measures that would lead to economic growth, job creation, a reduction in poverty and the delivery of high quality public services.  While taking account of these targets, it is important to take cognisance of what is happening in the real domestic economy and to citizens.  We cannot continue to chase targets that will further depress economic growth.  Any such plan should be brought before the Oireachtas and fully debated.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 5 seeks to require the Government to take into account issues such as the generation of economic growth, job creation and the delivery of high quality public services when drafting a plan to meet the debt and deficit targets contained in the Bill.  Amendment No. 6 aims to strengthen the requirement on the Government to include these important social and economic indicators.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to broaden the scope of the plan to include an impact assessment of any measure proposed in respect of key social indicators such as income equality, social inclusion and poverty reduction.  Amendment No. 8 seeks to place an obligation on the Government to carry out equality and anti-poverty impact assessments of all expenditure and revenue measures proposed in the plan.  Amendment No. 9 would require the seeking of the approval of the Oireachtas for any plan rather than Government approval only.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there would be adequate debate, public scrutiny and parliamentary oversight in the final agreement of the plan.  Given the significant impact its measures will have on the social and economic well being of the State and its people, such a debate and public and parliamentary oversight are crucial.  Amendment No. 11 seeks to introduce a provision that would allow a future Government to derogate from the debt and deficit rules if it believed that doing so would be in the best social and economic interests of the State.  If the Government did so decide, the amendment would place a requirement on the Government to explain why that was the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000033#GG00700","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1353433500,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I have tabled an amendment in this group, namely, amendment No. 10, which proposes to change the timeframe from two months to one month.

As stated during the D\u00e1il debates, on both Committee and Report Stages, the policy issues raised in the amendments are of much wider scope than the substance of the Bill.  The Senators have identified some of the issues any Government would have to consider in preparing a correction or budgetary plan.  However, it should be noted that we are talking about a plan, not the actual detailed legislative and budgetary proposals that would have to be brought before the Oireachtas in the normal way.<\/p><p>A key purpose of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill and the stability treaty is to correct budget imbalances where we have deviated from converging with our medium-term budgetary objective, from the adjustment path or complying with a debt rule.  Section 6 was drafted on the basis of common principles, as required by the treaty.  While the Government - or any future Government - will always seek to promote economic growth, job creation and the delivery of high quality public services, it is highly likely that deployment of a correction plan could result in unpalatable choices that might not be in compliance with the suggested amendments, at least in the short term.  Having sustainable public finances is a key element of sustainable economic growth.  Giving priority to economic growth, job creation and the delivery of high quality public services could, therefore, prove to be an obstacle to or a limitation on the Government's choice in terms of the actions needed to ensure sustainable public finances.<\/p> <p>In working to ensure the sustainability of public finances, any government should be able to access all possible policy levers.  Every budget day the Government publishes illustrative cases showing the effect of major changes in revenue and certain social welfare payments on the categories of married couples, civil partners and single income earners.  The impact of the budget on the various groups of people is set out.<\/p><p>With regard to requiring Oireachtas approval before adopting the plan, amendments which could result in the contravention of our treaty obligations cannot be accepted.  The stability treaty requires the triggering of a correction mechanism if there is a significant deviation from the medium term objective or the adjustment path towards it.  Furthermore, non-compliance with the budgetary rule would contravene the stability treaty.<\/p><p>I do not propose to accept Senator Barrett's amendment No. 10, which would require a statement to be laid before D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann within one month.  I am grateful for the comprehensive Private Members' Bill which the Senator introduced to this House.  His Bill was in effect parked because the Government is bringing forward its own legislation.  I assure him there is convergence between his legislation and what the Government proposes to do.  I hope the final Government Bill will reflect the key objectives he set out.  The Seanad decided not to oppose his Bill because it made a constructive contribution towards the final product that we are now debating.  <\/p><p>While amendment No. 10 makes an interesting contribution to the debate and suggests a need for urgency, I remind Senator Barrett that the plan under discussion involve steps aimed at avoiding the breach of the budgetary rule.  Such a plan could involve information on budgetary and expenditure measures.  The preparation of such material takes time and a tight deadline would only contribute to an increased risk of error.  The recent economic history of this country suggests that events have a tendency to overtake us.  Two scenarios spring to mind.  The first is where the Government concludes that it may fail to comply in the run up to the annual budget.  A requirement to present a plan within one month could result in two major budgetary announcements being made in a matter of weeks when it may be more appropriate to await the national budgetary announcement.  A second scenario would be where a requirement falls due during or just after a general election campaign.  Such matters should be left to an incoming Government to decide.  For these reasons, the provision was drafted using the word &quot;may&quot; and the period of two months.  There is nothing to prevent the Government from publishing its plans within one month and that would be the optimal timeframe but the Minister for Finance believes that setting a deadline of one month is too prescriptive.  The general framework of two months allows greater latitude in terms of what has to occur under this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000033#GG00900","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<ul><br>In page 7, subsection (2), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<ul>&#8220;(<i>e<\/i>) outline how revenue and expenditure measures will contribute to the objectives of greater income equality, social inclusion and poverty reduction.&#8221;.<\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH00400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<ul><br>In page 7, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:<ul>&#8220;(3) All revenue and expenditure measures contained in the plan must be subject to equality and anti-poverty impact assessments the details of which will be published as appendices to the plan.&#8221;.<\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH00600","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<ul><br>In page 7, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection: <ul>&#8220;(3) The plan shall only be adopted following approval of the Oireachtas.&#8221;.<\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH00800","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 10 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<ul><br>In page 7, subsection (5) lines 32 and 33, to delete all words from and including &#8220;outlining&#8221; in line 32 down to and including &#8220;failure&#8221; in line 33 and substitute the following:<ul>&#8220;outlining the reasons it considers non-compliance with the budgetary rule to be in the best social and economic interests of the citizens and the State&#8221;.<\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH01100","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353434100,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett asked a question earlier about the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH01400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I asked about the difference-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH01500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The question was about subsections (4) and (5).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000034#HH01600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434100,"counter":309,"content":"<p>If I read the sections correctly, which of course may not be the case - I thank the Minister of State for his earlier remarks - \"shall\" applies if the news is good and \"may\" applies if the news is bad.

The fiscal council has been established to address gaps in fiscal policy analysis and to provide assessments and recommendations on fiscal policy.  Imposing a wide mandate on the fiscal council would require larger resources, both in staff and budgetary allocation.  Expanding the mandate would likely impede the council's ability to fulfil its core functions, including those specified in the treaty.  Furthermore, some of the suggested functions are the job of the Government.  It is important to note that a number of bodies are supported by the State, such as the ESRI and the NESC, and their reports consider all aspects of policy development, including the social impact.<\/p><p>In addition, we are not willing to assign functions that are not outlined in the Bill to the fiscal council.  The view is that the task of the fiscal council is quite straightforward.  It is to give its view to the country and the Government on fiscal policy generally.  If the intention of the amendment is to widen that remit, it could take away from the core function, which is to give independent advice to the Government.  As I mentioned previously, the council's remit is to be the contrarian, to take the opposite view and put pressure on the Government to justify its position.  If we extend its remit into a range of other areas, not only do we take from other agencies that comment on these matters, but we take the focus of the council's fundamental task.  We wish to ensure that the fiscal council has the resources it needs to complete its core functions.  Expanding the functions would stretch the resources of the council to a point where its focus and attention would be removed from its primary role.  We do not want that to happen.<\/p><p>Amendments that add requirements which are already covered by the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, which are published in the annual stability programme update, are unnecessary.  Section 2, Article 3, of the 1997 surveillance and co-ordination regulations requires the State to take into account the future pension liabilities of the State and this information is contained in the annual stability programme update.  The fiscal council is required to provide an assessment of the official forecasts, which includes an assessment of the stability programme update.

I have a little less confidence in the bodies mentioned by the Minister of State.  They were all in place when we got into this trouble, hence we need a new institution.  The NESC represented the Secretaries General of approximately six Departments and the social partners and I would hate to rely on it for much advice as we move forward trying to address this problem.  The same could be said of certain other institutions, including perhaps the ESRI, which told us the banking crisis was manageable.<\/p><p>  We got into trouble to such a degree between 2008 and 2010 that we need this new institution.  Therefore, I would like it to comment on these issues.  The council has been set up under the umbrella of fiscal responsibility and should comment on anything it wishes to in order to retain fiscal responsibility in this country.  For instance, we might say the IMF has a cheek advising us on the health service, but if it genuinely believes the way we run the health service has contributed to the problems we are all trying to address, it should be entitled to say that.  It may not look for funds to reorganise the health service, but if it sees problems, it should be able to point them out.<\/p><p>  We know the problems it saw.  The regulatory capture of the Exchequer by the banks on that notorious evening, the success of lobbying by various groups, such as construction and banking, poor appraisals of capital and the health case it is concerned about.  When the IMF is gone, will the impetus it has given to the Minister of State and Ministers Howlin and Noonan to speak out be gone?  Will they continue to be able to say to the Minister for Health, for example, that they are sorry, but compared to what they are trying to do to run the country, with a 60% debt to GDP ratio and unable to borrow more than 0.5%, they require the problems of the spending Departments which have a proven track record of attracting the annoyance of the IMF during our rescue period to be addressed.  Issues such as stealth taxes and so on must be addressed.  We must also address weaknesses in monetary policy, such as that we spoke about earlier with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, namely, the vast increase in lending outside manufacturing and agriculture.  To retain the fiscal responsibility status to which we all aspire requires the fiscal council, as the guardians of that, not to be bound by the fact that other institutions, like the Central Bank, the ESRI and the NESC, did not do their job.  That is why we have set up this new institution, the fiscal council.  Having the contrarian view, as described by the Minister of State, would be viable.  I recall an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i> some weeks ago by two former assistant secretaries in the Department of Transport, Pat Mangan and John Lumsden.  We need that contrarian culture, but we do not have it.<\/p><p>  How are we to ensure all the mistakes we made do not happen again?  If the fiscal council can help us, as the independent voice described by the Minister of State - which we support - let it speak out, rather than have a lawyer go through the Stability and Growth Pact saying the council cannot say anything about the health service because it is not in the pact agreed by 27 other countries or whatever.  Instead, we should say: &quot;Yes, it is addressing the Irish situation.&quot;  It is about time certain lobby groups and certain successful cases of regulatory capture had in fact a contrary voice to assist the Cabinet in bringing the country to solvency and keeping it there.  Whatever forces undermine that, it is a good idea if the fiscal council can give them a lash, particularly since some of the other watchdogs were asleep and did not bark during critical periods.  Hence the need for this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000035#JJ00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1353434700,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his amendment as it has opened up this debate.

Group think is the predominant culture upon which the economy crashed.  This was highlighted in a number of reports on the financial crisis.  We are entirely satisfied that the fiscal council has the independence and the ability to manoeuvre and speak out on all of these issues.  Its task is primarily to highlight questions of fiscal imbalances.  The reason fiscal imbalances occur is because expenditure gets out of kilter or tax revenues from one year to the next do not meet their target.  With regard to why this has happened, it is logical the fiscal council would comment on the reasons or point out that under a particular subhead, we have not obtained what we wanted or another area of expenditure is way out of kilter. <\/p><p>The considered view of the Minister for Finance is that the council's independence and ability to speak out and assess the situation is unlimited in terms of what it must say.

They spent beyond their taxable capacity.  They borrowed in a way that destroyed capital markets and caused property booms.  It would be extremely good if Professor John McHale and his inestimable colleagues were able to write about whatever they wish to write about.  It struck me as the Minister of State was talking that many of the things which got us into this trouble were commented on over many years by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an officer under the Constitution.  As we make decisions on how to put our finances right, we should draw on a great deal of the material that is available and give full powers to the learned people concerned.  I think the Minister of State has said he agrees with that.  This is a multifaceted problem.  Many things went wrong.  It is up to all the people working in the Houses of the Oireachtas to make a contribution to seeing how fiscal responsibility can be restored and retained in this country.

I expect that the Senator has some sympathy with the fiscal council's view that the adjustment should be bigger.  The council's statements immediately put the Government on the spot.  It is a good thing that the Government has to justify quickly the parameters used when setting a budget or the rationale used for a particular adjustment.

I look forward to debating our pre-budget submission with him at a later stage.  Amendments Nos. 14 and 16 essentially aim to ensure there is adequate public scrutiny of the advice of the fiscal council and the Government's response to that advice.  Amendment No. 14 seeks to place an obligation on the Government to respond to all assessments and advice made by the council.  I refer not only to advice stemming from the fiscal treaty, but also to advice on budgetary and stability programmes, official forecasts and the Stability and Growth Pact.

Reference has been made to certain advice that was unheard, unnoticed or dismissed in the past.  That has been well documented in the independent reports on the Irish economy that have been released in recent years.  If a statutory body is to give advice to the Department of Finance, I suggest that advice deserves a response in the form of an Oireachtas debate.  These two amendments call for that to happen.

At the time, Senator Reilly's colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, asked for a fuller response from the Department of Finance to the reports of the fiscal advisory council.  When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, committed to get such a response, that was accepted by Deputy Doherty.  The same amendment was not moved on Report Stage by Deputy Doherty, who noted the Minister's response.  The evidence of the commitment given by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, can be seen in chapter 6 of the medium-term fiscal statement that was published last week.  I understand that the chapter in question includes an assessment along the lines of that requested by Deputy Doherty.  The Bill does not require to be amended because we have agreed to act in this manner from now on when we publish medium-term fiscal statements.  A section covering the matters that Deputy Doherty asked about will be included.  We do not think there is a need to put it into the Bill because we are already doing it.

The Government does respond to the assessments of the council.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has responded to the council's reports in its stability programme updates and in its medium-term fiscal statements.<\/p> <p>Placing this requirement on a legislative basis would be difficult.  The assessments arising from the council's general functions under subsection (4) can be wide-ranging and contain a great deal of analysis and a large number of recommendations.  Would Government have to respond to every line of the recommendations or analysis or just a few of the main items?  In any event, the Government answers to the Oireachtas and the mechanisms available therein can be used to elicit further responses to council reports.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the Houses to decide what they want to debate.  It would be a little previous for the Government to dictate what the Houses should do.  It is a matter for them to decide what they want.  There is nothing to prevent the Houses from deciding to debate these reports at times suitable to them.  <\/p><p>The reference to subsection (3) is a reference to the core functions of the fiscal council under the treaty.  In the assessments in question, the fiscal council will analyse, if exceptional circumstances exist or have ceased to exist, and also examine the Government's compliance with section 6 regarding the corrective mechanism.  The specifics of the assessments arise from the provisions of the treaty and are precise requirements.  They are treaty requirements with which we must comply on the basis of acceptance of the treaty.<\/p><p>With regard to providing for placing requests for a debate in this legislation, requests for debate are as I said earlier, a matter for the Oireachtas.  As stated by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on Report Stage the Government is never reluctant to have debates on any issue.  It is clear that a special report of a more crucial nature should take priority and we will be bound to debate that.  However, the provision for a D\u00e1il debate need not be written into every piece of legislation.  Debate is the normal work of the D\u00e1il and is arranged between the Whips.  In addition, it is not appropriate to place in legislation a requirement for debates.  <\/p><p>With regard to the shorter timeline as set out by Senator Barrett, as stated earlier this legislation aims to prepare for all eventualities.  At the risk that a Government could not prepare such a statement due to an event such as a general election could result in non-compliance with the legislation.  It is a type of unintended consequence argument that frequently crops up in legislation, if one attempts to be too prescriptive.  While this could be the case with a two month deadline the chances are lessened.  As such, I do not intend to accept this amendment, although I do understand the intent behind it.  It is the intention of the Government to do so within a month anyway but there could be difficulties if it is prescribed that it do so within a month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000036#KK01400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353435900,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353435900,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353435900,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353435900,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353435900,"counter":339,"content":"<p>SCHEDULE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353435900,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The period between 2008-2010 was a disaster in this regard.  We would not, when recruiting a veterinary surgeon, say that it is &quot;desirable&quot; that he or she have particular qualifications rather we would say that it is a &quot;requirement&quot; that that be the case.  We would not say that it is &quot;desirable&quot; that people in the health service should have a knowledge of medicine rather it is a &quot;requirement&quot; that that be the case.  We do not desire that architects have qualifications, it is a requirement that they have such a competence.  It is an absolute essential.<\/p><p>  To attempt to remedy the situation in which we find ourselves by saying that it is &quot;desirable&quot; that we appoint qualified people is too weak in terms of what we are trying to do.  It is stated on page 44 of the Wright report that of a cadre of 542 staff in the Department of Finance only 39 are economists.  It is a requirement that we step up in these matters.  Economics is no longer only for amateurs.  We are all aware of the problems that arose when we previously had amateurs in this area.  Let us ensure we appoint people with the highest possible qualifications and move away from the tradition of it being an optional extra type of subject.  <\/p><p>  Paragraph 3(1)(<i>a<\/i>) provides that the Minister in appointing members to the fiscal council shall have regard to the desirability of their having competence and experience in domestic or international macro-economic or fiscal matters.  Amendment No. 18 seeks to delete &quot;or&quot; and substitute &quot;monetary and&quot;.  It was in the monetary sector that the problems were created not alone in Ireland but in other areas.  Wall Street versus main street and quantitative easing to solve the problem of the decline in the computer industry at the beginning of the decade have huge influence down the line in terms of causing property bubbles and destroying banking systems.  We need to ensure those appointed to the fiscal council are qualified.  The monetary sector can and did do huge damage because many of the watchdogs working therein were fast asleep.  <\/p><p>  The amendment seeks to ensure that people are properly qualified and that what is going on in banking is monitored.  I note references in some of the UK newspapers today to the Bank of England needing to be cleaned up.  We will end up in trouble again if we continue with these monetary policies.  In broader terms, we need a Government economic service not alone in the Department of Finance but the other spending Departments.  We are trying to remedy where in the past there has been a lack of this expertise, plus the other facts referred to by the Minister of State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000037#LL00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1353435900,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Barrett for tabling these amendments.  This is an important debate.  I have previously been in the House when Senator Barrett raised the issue of the number of people in the Department of Finance with economics qualifications.  I expected the Senator would raise the issue again today and have with me the statistics in this regard.<\/p><p>I am glad to inform the Senator that 99 civil servants in the Department of Finance have qualifications in economics, including two PhDs, 37 masters, 46 degrees, 7 diplomas and 7 certificates.  There are approximately 300 people working in the Department of Finance which means at least one third of them have economics qualifications.  I am reliably informed that, since coming into office, the Government has been focused on bringing in people from the outside who have another perspective to add to the dimensions of the discussion.  Approximately 40% of new recruits are from outside the public sector and have economics qualifications.  The Senator's figure of 36 is as such outdated.<\/p><p>I do not propose to accepts amendments Nos. 17 and 18 for the following reasons.  In filling vacancies on the council, the Minister for Finance will have cognisance of the need to have people with the right competence and experience.  However, other factors may need to be considered.  For example, gender balance or the provision of local knowledge and presence if the remainder of the council are from abroad.  In such circumstances, it is prudent to retain some slight flexibility in the legislation.  We are not against what the Senator is suggesting.  However, tying this to legislation may prove difficult.  The existing council is made up of Professor McHale based in Galway, Dr. Barrett based in Dublin, Dr. Barnes from the OECD in Paris, Ms R\u00f3is\u00edn O'Sullivan, USA, and Dr. Donal O'Donovan who is retired from the IMF and lives in Washington.  One could argue that this composition of members represents a broad reflection of international and domestic experience.  These are people with knowledge internally and externally, coming from an academic background having worked with large scale international organisations and, like Senator Barrett, universities.<\/p> <p>That is reflected in the composition of the council.  However, I suspect it will never be possible to get it entirely right.  The Minister requires flexibility in order to ensure he can balance all of these factors in reaching a decision on the membership of the council.<\/p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 17 for two reasons.  First, the Fiscal Advisory Council is in place to advise on fiscal matters.  The Government may or may not take advice on such matters.  However, in the case of EMU, monetary policy is a matter for the European system of central banks.  The Government has no functions or powers in respect of such a policy.  The second reason is that the amendment would require any person appointed to the council to have competence and experience in domestic or international macroeconomic monetary and fiscal matters, that is, all three subject areas.  This might make matters difficult in identifying candidates with the correct qualifications.<\/p><p>The spirit of amendments Nos. 17 and 18 is very much in keeping with what we are trying to do, namely, achieve the correct balance between international and domestic experience such as that possessed by persons who work with large-scale international bodies and in universities in order that the council will speak with authority.  To date, we have done a good job in getting the balance right, particularly in the case of the five individuals whose names I have given to the House.  I am sure that would be the intention of any future Minister for Finance, but Senators may be of the view that I would say this anyway.  However, there might be unintended consequences if we were to accept amendments Nos. 17 and 18.  As a result, we do not propose to accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000037#LL00900","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353436500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>We are making progress.  It took from 1922 to 2010 to recruit 39 economists.  That is a rate of less than one every two years.  In the 23 months since publication of the relevant report in 2010, we have recruited a further 60.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on bringing the number up from 39 to 99.  That is progress.  The people concerned should, of course, possess the relevant expertise.  I agree with the Minister of State that the five recruited prior to our dealing with this legislation are top class.  Everybody acknowledges that fact.  They all appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the members thereof who come from different sides of both Houses accepted their bona fides.  It is critical that we find people with the necessary expertise.  We need not just the 60 individuals who have been recruited, we also require additional and similarly qualified individuals for other spending Departments.  Is there a health economist in the Department of Health?  Is there anyone in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who possesses expertise in economics?  It was the position in respect of the latter that caused two people to write an article in a Sunday newspaper in which they stated contrarian views were required.<\/p><p>There are huge budgets at stake and they are being spent by a very small number of qualified individuals.  Admittedly, we are moving in the right direction.  I commend the Minister for Finance on more than doubling the number of suitably qualified staff in the 23 months since Mr. Wright published his report in December 2010.  The improvements are commendable.  Economics for amateurs got us into the current mess.  However, we are not going to proceed further down that road.  The Fiscal Advisory Council has a vital role to play in that regard.  As indicated, I want the economists recruited by the State to provide advice to display the same professionalism as that shown by veterinarians, doctors and architects.  This is an important matter and we need the level of expertise to which I refer.  I commend the Minister for Finance on the improvements he has made through recruiting an additional 60 suitably qualified individuals into his Department.  I hope similarly qualified individuals will be recruited into other major spending Departments in order that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000038#MM00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1353436500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The Senator has highlighted a very important point, namely, that it is important to have economists not just in the Department of Finance but also in other high spending Departments.

As the Senator points out, it is crucial that these Departments have in their employ suitably qualified and competent staff.  Many people who previously worked in the Department of Finance have gone on to enjoy very illustrious careers in other Departments.  Much of their training, both in the area of economics and in more general matters relating to the Department, has been of assistance in the formulation of policy in the Departments to which they have transferred.  I was obviously in opposition at the time, but there is anecdotal evidence that during the financial crisis it was not just the Department of Finance which tried to respond to the enormous difficulties which had arisen.  Staff in other Departments who had previously worked in the Department of Finance and trained economists assisted in the general effort which was required at that stage.  However, I take the Senator's point on the need to ensure it is not only the Department of Finance which requires suitably qualified staff.

This is one of the many amendments I have proposed, but it is also one of the most important.  If someone leaves or the chairman resigns, we should bring in a replacement quickly rather than waiting for half a year to do so.  As the Minister of State indicated, circumstances can change rapidly.  It was not the Government's intention for the council to have four members instead of five for a lengthy period.

The team should not be a man or a woman short.  The difficulty with the amendment is that it would remove the maximum stipulation of six months and reset it at one month.  As the Minister for Finance has previously indicated, that is a very short period.  Some reflection might be required across government in bringing forward a suitable candidate to replace someone who leaves the council.  In addition, the chosen individual may need to consider whether he or she wants to serve on the council.  The six month period proposed in the legislation would be the exception rather than the norm.  It would be the intention of the Government and the Minister of Finance to make appointments in a shorter timeframe.  As far as I am aware, it is solely a matter for the Minister to actually appoint replacements.  However, I am sure he would want to engage in reflection with a number of Government colleagues on any person who might be put forward as a replacement.  It is not his intention to take six months to fill a vacancy.  Limiting the period to one month would create difficulties from the perspective of the Minister and his ministerial colleagues engaging in discussions.  It would also give rise to problems for an individual being offered an appointment in the context of his or her having very limited time in which to decide whether to accept or decline such an offer.

This point was raised on Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il by Deputy Michael McGrath of Fianna F\u00e1il.  He put forward a similar proposal which required the Fiscal Council to provide an assessment of a policy proposal when requested to do so in writing by a committee of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  The proposal was rejected by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who said it would not be acceptable under the common principles as it could be seen as a threat to the independence of the council.  One concern expressed to the Department by the Fiscal Council during the preparation of the legislation was the possibility that a Minister would allocate additional functions without additional resources.  This concern was echoed by the troika.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, took that on board by ensuring that the functions of the Fiscal Council, as stated in the Bill, do not provide for additional functions to be given to the council.  The allocation of additional functions will require amending legislation which would ensure an opportunity to discuss appropriately matching resources.  The same point applies to this amendment.  I am sure the Senator does not intend this, but demanding that the council appear to discuss the attainment and retention of fiscal stability in front of any or all of the committees of the Oireachtas would be akin to giving the Oireachtas a blank cheque to demand its input on issues of fiscal stability for any policy and could put pressure on the council\u2019s performance of its essential duties.<\/p><p>The critical task we are asking the council to do in terms of the performance of its functions is set out in section 8.  That is what we are asking it to do in accepting the legislation.  Senator Barrett may be confusing this with another aspect of the provisions relating to the council's appearance before committees, as outlined in section 11 on page 14.  This is to do with the appropriation of funds to an organisation, which is standard practice for any organisation funded by the Oireachtas for the performance of its duties.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am very pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is dealing with this matter.<\/p><p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  Last week the committee heard a submission from Mr. Fred Barry, the chief executive of the National Roads Authority, and its officials.  In the course of the exchanges with all members relating to various roads projects, either up and running, dormant or planned, I asked a number of specific questions relating to the N16 in Leitrim.  The Minister of State will be familiar with this road because it is a link from Galway through Mayo, Sligo, Enniskillen and on to Belfast.  The N16 was originally on the national league study published with the first NRA report in 1999.  At that time it was indicated that it could be 2018 before any money would be spent on it.  A further national transport plan for 2020 was published in 2005 which also set out various aspirations relating to the development of our road network.  Over the past years there has been a growth in the development of our road network which has proved to be very important for economic renewal.  However, the N16 has languished.  Very little money has been spent on it.  It should be noted that it is a major trading route as well as a tourism route because it links the major centres of Galway through Mayo, Sligo and on to the North.<\/p><p>I asked Mr. Barry about the plans for the N16 and where it figured on the list.  He conceded that the state of the road was unacceptable.  He also agreed that it had been bounced around over the various studies, aspirations and policy decisions of the past 15 years.  More significant, I asked him about the position of the N16 on a list of priority projects - if such a list of priorities existed.  I assumed, naively, that a list existed.  I asked a rather innocent question as to the position of the N16 on the list.  Mr. Barry replied that there was no list.  I said it seemed strange that the NRA does not have a list of priorities for roads projects, notwithstanding the Government is tied for money and capital projects are limited.  For example, the Gort to Tuam road is proceeding and this is to be welcomed.  Mr. Barry justified the information on the basis that because the NRA had no money, there was not much point in having a list.  I decided the best action was to ask the Minister if his Department had a list.  How does the process work?  What would be the position of any road - not just the N16 - be it in Mayo or Leitrim, on the list of priorities?  Is it a case that a project is proceeded with around budget time or when there is a bit of money in the coffers?  How does the NRA decide?  No more than a prisoner who wants to know his release date, I would like to have some idea of whether it will be ten, 15 or 20 years.  I asked Mr. Barry the question in an attempt to elicit a response.  I did not anticipate that the Minister or his Department would say that the N16 is No. 5 on the list and it will be completed by 2020.  However, I am hoping there might be some bit of information from a Department that is not, I have to say, traditionally known for giving away too many secrets, no matter who is in government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000041#PP00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I remind both sides that there is a time limit on contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000041#PP00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I am not sure I have all the answers but I will give the answer which the Department has supplied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000041#PP00500","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The Minister of State knows where I am coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000041#PP00600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, and I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue in the House.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  However, the planning, design and implementation of individual national roads projects are matters for the National Roads Authority, the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The Government's infrastructure and capital investment framework formed the basis for a new national development plan for the period 2012 to 2016.  There was ongoing discussion with the National Roads Authority during the preparation of this investment framework.  The framework recognises that the key challenge in current financial circumstances is to try to ensure adequate maintenance of the national road network in order to protect the value of previous investments and that it is only possible to proceed with a very limited number of road improvement projects over the period to 2016.  The investment framework acknowledges that, given the scale and cost of future motorway and high quality dual carriageway projects, it would not be feasible to fund them directly from Exchequer resources.  Rather, it was intended to fund them by means of a public private partnership using private money to build and maintain these roads, to be repaid back by the Exchequer over an extended period in the form of availability payments.  In this context, provision was made for funding the Exchequer element of the N11 Arklow-Rathnew and Newlands Cross PPP scheme within the 2012 to 2016 capital budget.<\/p><p>It was indicated that while the private funding market was very challenging intensive efforts were being made to access funding for PPP projects with a view to the National Roads Authority progressing projects such as the Gort-Tuam PPP and the New Ross-Enniscorthy PPP.  In July this year, as part of the Government's infrastructure stimulus package, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that \u20ac850 million would be invested in upgrading the national motorway and primary route network.  As part of this plan, which will be funded in part from the proposed sale of State assets, three road PPP projects have been identified for funding.  These projects are, the N17-N18 Gort Tuam road, the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy road and the N25 New Ross bypass.  These projects, together with the N11 Arklow-Rathnew road and N7 Newlands Cross scheme, had been identified by the NRA some time ago as suitable for progression as PPPs.  These are projects where there is considerable certainty regarding the timeframe for implementation as all the lands required have been secured.<\/p><p>One further priority transport project is the Galway city bypass.  This is a 12 km orbital route for Galway city linking with the M6 major interurban route to Dublin.  The project is currently on hold pending the outcome of legal proceedings.  Depending on the outcome of those proceedings it is hoped to progress it as an additional PPP project.  Unfortunately, financial constraints mean that other worthwhile projects cannot go ahead in the short to medium term with progress very much dependent on the availability of funds after 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000041#PP00700","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

Everything depends on the state of the country's finances.  We can criticise what happened during the Celtic tiger era for many reasons, but one good thing that emerged was the road infrastructure provided.  There can be many criticisms, but that is one positive aspect.  PPPs are about investors who will only go where they will make money.  They are beginning to come back and people are beginning to have more confidence in the country.  We saw this in the funding generated from the auction of 4G mobile phone licences last week.  The Government expected to generate less money.  This shows that the shoots are emerging and that things are looking a little better.  There is a little confidence in the country and everything boils down to growth.  The more money there is in the economy, the more opportunities we will have to allocate funding for road projects.  The Department is committed to the N17-N18 Gort-Tuam and the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy road projects and the N25 New Ross bypass project and I hope they will commence.

Niall Molloy could have died of a heart attack.  When he said &quot;Yes&quot;, the judge directed that the jury be dismissed and found the accused not guilty of manslaughter.  There have since been damning statements by Circuit Court judges who were critical of the fact that the judge had taken the case.  Senior garda\u00ed have also been critical of the Garda murder investigation.  A prominent surgeon who attended the wedding said his life was in turmoil having witnessed the murder and that he could not live with himself.  He died a few weeks later at the age of 50.  Other garda\u00ed in recent times have come out in support of undertaking another investigation.  The Catholic Church wants the case to be reopened.  Files relating to the murder were robbed by Martin Cahill from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions during the investigation.  Veronica Guerin's home was shot at when she raised her head about the case.  Paul Williams wrote a book entitled, <i>Bedfellows, <\/i>in which he chronicled what had happened.  To date, nobody has challenged anything written in the book.  Apart from the Garda inquiry by the cold case squad which, apparently, has concluded, according to the latest edition of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, and found there was no cover up, I have given 12 good reasons an independent commission of investigation should be set up.<\/p><p>  Prior to the general election, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party vowed that if they got into power, an investigation into the death of Fr. Molloy would be a priority.  The credibility of the institutions of the State is at stake and there is only one way to restore confidence in them.  I would like to think the Minister will not shatter public confidence in our institutions by failing to sanction an independent commission of inquiry.  The Molloy family, the friends and neighbours of Fr. Molloy and the people of the country deserve it.  As Shakespeare said, &quot;Something is rotten in the State of Denmark&quot;.  If he was in Ireland in the mid-1980s, Denmark would have been off the hook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000042#QQ01800","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1353438600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unable to be present because of other business.  However, he is fully aware of the concerns expressed about the death of Fr. Niall Molloy and sympathises greatly with the Molloy family.  <\/p><p>  Fr. Molloy's death was the subject of an investigation by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na which resulted in the submission of an investigation file to the law officers who directed that a person be charged with manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  At the subsequent trial, in June 1986, directions to acquit were given by the judge.  The circumstances of Fr. Molloy's death gave rise to considerable public concern at the time and the Minister appreciates that the family has sought answers ever since as to how its well loved relative met his death.  I am sure Senators will join me in also expressing sympathy to other families during the years whose loved ones were killed and where the perpetrators were never brought to justice.<\/p><p>  Most recently the concerns raised surrounding the death of Fr. Molloy found expression in the publication of a newspaper article in October 2010, accompanied by strong representations made by the family.  It is important that we acknowledge, in particular, the journalistic work of Ms Gemma O'Doherty in unearthing information on the case for the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  On foot of this development, the Garda Commissioner arranged for a detective superintendent to meet Ms O'Doherty, as the author of the article, as well as family members.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this was to facilitate an assessment of whether there was any evidence that was not available to the original investigation team and whether further investigation was required in the case.  Shortly after the Minister's appointment, he inquired into the steps being taken by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and was advised of the position.  He has at all times emphasised the importance of all relevant matters being thoroughly examined and investigated.  This examination is ongoing and the Minster is receiving regular updates from the Commissioner.  The Garda authorities have indicated that during the examination additional information was provided to the investigating garda\u00ed identifying further lines of inquiry which have had to be followed up.  The Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister that each and every one of these lines of inquiry is being, or will be, pursued.  The Minister also understands that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep Fr. Molloy's family members updated on progress.<\/p><p>The Minister is well aware of the many issues of concern raised in the public domain surrounding the circumstances of Fr. Molloy's death and the context in which some form of inquiry has been considered desirable, but what needs to be considered first and foremost is that the matters at the heart of the Garda examination relate to potential criminal liability and, in that context, possible charges.  It is important, therefore, that nothing is said or done which could prejudice or be seen to prejudice criminal proceedings.  Moreover, in any case in which criminal behaviour is suspected, it is only through a Garda investigation and, where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available, through the submission of a file by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions that persons can be brought fully to account before the courts.  This cannot be done by a commission of investigation, through journalistic inquiries or by any other type of review, no matter how thorough or independent.<\/p><p>The best form of justice for the Molloy family would be for anyone who has criminal liability in his tragic death to be brought to account through facing charges.  In the Minister's view, it would be deeply inappropriate to do anything which could prejudice the possibility of that happening.  It is also of crucial importance that the Garda receives the fullest co-operation from any individual who can provide information of relevance to the inquires being conducted.  Whatever questions there may be about the original investigation, people should not prejudge the outcome of the current Garda examination.  That examination, in the Minister's view, must be allowed to proceed unhindered, and he has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that all relevant evidence will be fully pursued, wherever it may lead.  The House will appreciate that ultimately a criminal prosecution must be based on hard evidence, not rumour, speculation or conjecture.  The Garda examination has not been completed and, accordingly, any media reports of its findings are, of their nature, speculative.<\/p><p>I would like to make clear that the Minister's commitment to reviewing the situation when he receives a final report from the Garda Commissioner remains firmly in place.  Against that background, I hope the House can accept that we all share the desire to see justice done as much as possible in this case.  I have tried to set out why, in the first instance, the best chance of achieving this lies with allowing the current Garda examination to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000042#QQ01900","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353439200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Senator should be conscious that the Minister of State is not the Minister responsible when posing questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000043#RR00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1353439200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I do not have questions.

Perhaps the reply was written last Friday because <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> this week clearly stated that the Garda investigation had concluded and no evidence of a cover-up had been found.  Today the Molloy family wrote to the Garda Commissioner asking him to remove all of the members of the serious crime review team from the investigation.  That is why I believe the Minister of State's response was written last Friday and is not up to date.  The Minister said that if he was in power, he would give this investigation priority.

A primary care centre is needed in the area.  There are more than 1,150 local authority houses in the immediate area, along with a significant catchment of private housing.

The key objective of the primary care strategy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and members of other health care disciplines.  This is central to this Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health system.  The Southern Health Board, SHB, entered into an arrangement with Cork City Council in late 2004 to provide accommodation for primary care services at a new community development the council was planning to build at Harbour View Road, Knocknaheeny.  The intention at the time was to locate a number of key core primary care services in the new facility.  The SHB entered into this arrangement prior to the development of the current strategy for the delivery of primary care infrastructure.  The building is deemed by the HSE to be considerably smaller than what is required in the context of the current strategy.<\/p><p>The facility at Harbour View Road, Knocknaheeny, is one of four blocks on a community service campus, which was constructed by the city council on its property.  The council, at its November 2012 meeting, approved a proposal to lease the property to the HSE.  The council will provide the HSE with the appropriate support documentation, including title, statutory permissions relating to planning and fire regulations and completion certificates, which will allow the proposed lease to be considered by the HSE property committee within the next four weeks in line with HSE property approval protocols.  Until this process is completed, the HSE will not be in a position to begin to deliver services from the leased building.<\/p><p>The HSE's capital plan 2012-2016 contains provision for the delivery of a primary care centre at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital campus.  The leased facility will be used to accommodate primary care staff prior to the permanent move to the new primary care centre to be constructed at the St. Mary's campus.  It is envisaged that following the completion of the new HSE primary care centre at St. Mary's, the leased building could be used to accommodate services that complement health care services to be delivered from the campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112000043#RR00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1353439200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I am surprised by this response.
