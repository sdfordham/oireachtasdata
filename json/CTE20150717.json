The establishment of the Child and Family Agency was a unique opportunity to act on the issues of accountability and transparency.  There has been considerable progress in that regard, but achieving consistency remains more elusive and a work in progress.  There are clear lines of accountability, as well as clarity in budget allocation and action being taken when services are not performing to expectation.  This progress has been validated in reports and audits.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in its annual report for 2014 confirms progress in services in most parts of the country, while the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited and certified the financial statements for Tusla&rsquo;s first year of operation.<\/p> <p>  In areas in which the guidance and practice of the service delivery framework are followed there has been significant improvement.  In a small number of areas, however, there has been insufficient progress, even taking into account pressures on resources and in recruitment.  In most of the country duty and intake arrangements have been reformed.  While service pressures remain, unallocated cases are reviewed and prioritised.  The number of cases, particularly those designated as a high priority, is reducing.  An audit has recently been completed and the findings submitted to the Department for its consideration.  There is a need to be resourced to intervene, screen, assess and allocate all appropriate referrals and increase local staff complements to ensure further backlogs do not occur.<\/p><p> In short, services are improving but the agenda for further reform is clear.  The consolidation of services for children and families was the right way to proceed.  Achievements to date are the result of political will and focused professional commitment from extremely hard-working colleagues.  The pace of reform and improvement remains inhibited, however, by continuing financial and resource pressures both on the front line and in terms of corporate support, whether directly from Tusla or through shared service arrangements.  Having survived the demanding circumstances of its first year of operation, it is necessary for the agency to move from establishment to sustainability.  The experience of amalgamating three services with three very different cultures has been both challenging and enlightening.  Now is the time to take stock, regroup and create a sustainable future.<\/p><p> As set out in the first appendix, how to build that sustainable future has been the focus of wide-ranging consultation with staff.  Meetings have involved 25% of total staff, a detailed online survey and further discussions with partners.  A report on the consultation will be brought to the board in 31 July, as will proposals for a streamlined, sustainable structure into the future.  Significant progress has been made.  For the first time, we have a clear picture of total investment in Ireland's most vulnerable children.  A lot has been achieved, not least the provision of objective and validated HR, financial and performance data.  There is clarity as to what has been achieved and the areas that need to improve.  Some of the unknown unknowns are now known.  We know what is required to introduce lasting sustainable change and the foundations are in place in that regard.  A new legal entity was created with no additional investment.  We accepted the discipline of austerity, but investment is now required.<\/p><p> The second appendix outlines our business plan.  Further improvements have been designed and are being implemented.  The business of agency establishment continues and that activity is now organised in line with the five key outcomes of the corporate plan, which is summarised in the appendix.  I draw members' attention, in particular, to the fact that agreement has, at last, been reached on an out-of-hours social work service.  Rotas are being drawn up and the service will go live in the autumn.  In addition, after a range of technical difficulties to do with security have been addressed, the child protection notification system will be accessible to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and emergency medical services on a 24-7 basis.  That, too, is due to go live in the autumn.  The vast majority of the business plan targets are on schedule, despite the fact that corporate support capacity is well below that available to comparator organisations.<\/p><p> The final appendix sets out the significant progress towards our aim of being a self-evaluating organisation.  We are now able to report all aspects of service delivery, finance, HR, legal and impacts on the ground.  A consultation is being completed on the development of a quality assurance framework.  The principle of proportionate intervention has been established, not least through the ground-breaking activity in the midlands and in Louth-Meath.  We believe in high support and high challenge.<\/p><p> In summary, establishing a legal entity at a time of austerity and no additional resources has been challenging.  Despite those challenges, service accountability and performance continue to improve.  Most recently, for example, education welfare services were restructured and realigned to address a number of challenges and reports regarding national leadership and governance over schemes and projects.  More formal engagement with the voluntary sector has been promoted with the introduction of Meitheal and the establishment of commissioning services.  The integration of three distinct organisations into a cohesive agency has been challenging, but much has been achieved in developing a single entity with a single focus on services for children and families.<\/p><p> The establishment of Tusla amounts to a significant step forward from past practice.  However, the past is not the only benchmark; we need to do well by today's best standards and look to the future.  There is clarity of information regarding services currently being delivered.  There is clarity regarding the reform agenda required.  It is clear, too, that improvement cannot be achieved without investment.  At a time of austerity, commitment and dedication have delivered an extraordinary range of improvements.  Looking ahead, however, the capacity to build on those improvements and provide a consistent service the length and breadth of the country will require not only continued dedication but also sufficient resources.  Having made the progress we have, the lesson of the past is that we must never again let Ireland's vulnerable children down.  Investment in our children is vital as we move from survival to sustainability.  It is all about putting children first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes for his presentation.

Mr. Jeyes concluded his statement by emphasising the need for additional investment.  As I recall, he indicated at the time the budget Estimates were being discussed last year that the agency required an extra &euro;42 million in funding just to stand still.  He was unable to secure that amount, but there was an increase in funding of &euro;24 million or so.  How has Tusla been able to manage the increase in the number of children in care with allocated social workers and with a written plan and the numbers receiving aftercare services given that he indicated, less than 12 months ago, that an additional &euro;42 million was needed just to ensure the agency stands still?  This week, the D&aacute;il passed the Children First Bill 2014, which places the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  Are the delegates confident they have the necessary resources to ensure the provisions set out in that legislation become a reality?<\/p> <p>  In the past, the HSE published social worker statistics on a quarterly basis which set out the number of children in care, the number with an allocated social worker and the number with a dedicated care plan.  Tusla produces a similar report measuring pressures in the system on a quarterly basis.  Why is it necessary to submit a freedom of information request in order to access those reports?  Where is the transparency in that?<\/p> <p>  When the delegates appeared before the committee in May, we spoke about the appalling situation in Laois-Offaly.  I requested on that occasion that all 17 areas be examined to ensure practice there was not replicated elsewhere in the country.  Has that review taken place?  After the meeting, I highlighted to Mr. Jeyes the situation in a particular region.  His office subsequently contacted me for further information, which I supplied.  Will he quantify the optimum level of social workers needed to ensure all children in care have a dedicated social worker and a care plan?  Will he confirm whether or not that target has been met?  I am not asking whether or not it is being met on paper; that might well be the case even if 200 or so social workers, say, are out on maternity leave.<\/p><p>Have we a sufficient number of social workers to do the job that needs to be done?<\/p><p> Mr. Jeyes stated, \"Accountability has been strengthened with clear line management responsibility.\", and he spoke about accountability, consistency and transparency in May 2015.  Has anyone been held accountable in Laois-Offaly?  Has anybody been held accountable in the other regions that have highlighted incompetence or malpractice - whatever way one wishes to describe it?<\/p><p> One of the other matters identified during the previous meeting Mr. Jeyes attended was that we do not have an efficient computerised system to keep an effective record or log of what is going on.  This would have been a basic requirement in the establishment of a new agency.  Would Mr. Jeyes agree that it was inappropriate that the agency was established without this?  Have plans been put in place to ensure that this will be established, and at what cost?  Will additional resources be made available this year to ensure that this is established because, without an effective and efficient log system, it is difficult to keep a handle on everything that is going on in a particular region?<\/p><p> Recently, the Minister - I am sorry, Mr. Jeyes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#E00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Not yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Within six months, Mr. Jeyes might be.

For a moment, I will be parochial.  A group in Mullingar that deals with domestic abuse had its funding cut by 100% with no prior knowledge.  Basically, the agency wrote out one week stating that within whatever the period, say six weeks, the funding would be cut.  My party subsequently raised it on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the Minister intervened which I acknowledge, and a stay of execution was put in place.  It was said that nothing would happen until an alternative was put in place.  If an alternative will be put in place, surely the alternative should be put in place before the agency discontinues a service, especially a critical service dealing with domestic abuse.<\/p><p>Finally, I will make a point about the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  As Opposition TDs, we are always criticised that we are looking for spending in additional areas.  Last week I produced a piece of legislation on the regulation of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>which would ensure regulation of this sector which is currently unregulated, open to manipulation, open to abuse and, effectively, a cash cow for some.  At a time of scarce resources, should we be regulating a sector that is breaking Tusla?  It should be a priority to regulate that sector so that the scarce resources could be diverted to maintaining and providing the front-line services which is what this agency is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#F00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of Tusla here this morning and commend Mr. Jeyes on his commitment and efforts.  I thank him for the comprehensive presentation which gives us a clear overview of the work taking place within Tusla.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Regarding the organisational structure, can Mr. Jeyes give us an update on the after-care services?  He states that there was a 15% increase in this regard.  I wonder whether most of this in disadvantaged areas.  Where, and how, are these services being provided?  Is there is a tie-in with local schools for the provision and whether there are plans to extend it.  Is it Mr. Jeyes's view that the programme has been successful?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes states in his presentation that practices still vary in some parts of the country.  I wonder where, and how, it varies, and have the issues we previously discussed in Louth been addressed.  He states that \"the allocation of a budget based on needs analysis will be a priority\".  How will that be determined?<\/p> <p>  Information technology, IT, facilities came up previously at our meetings.  In that regard, Mr. Jeyes states that further change is necessary.  As I stated, we discussed the issue of the IT systems and maybe the lack of them.  Has there been improvement since, is funding being allocated to the necessary upgrading and, if so, how much?<\/p> <p>  On the NCCIS, Mr. Jeyes states the phase is operational in some non-computerised areas.  I wonder how can this work.  Could he explain how that can tie in to a national overall system if it is non-computerised?  How much outsourcing is in place for the national out-of-hours services?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the implementation of the Children First Bill, what will be the immediate firsts steps in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Dealing with complaints, by how much, if any, has the staff ratio for this work increased?  The vast majority of business plan targets are being met, Mr. Jeyes states, despite the fact that corporate support capacity is well below comparator organisations.  To what organisations is he comparing it?<\/p> <p>  A number of organisations have recently had their funding cut in mid-year, and some without prior notification.  Can he comment on why this is happening?<\/p> <p>  He states that Tusla has made significant progress despite resource constraints, increasing service demands and austerity measures.  I note this is a trend.  All across Mr. Jeyes' presentations, he mentions resources and investment.  In his summary, he states \"it is clear too that improvement cannot be achieved without investment.\"  Is he of the opinion that resources are still tight?  How much does Tusla need in the next budget to sufficiently and adequately improve services?  The implication is that Tusla is operating under tight financial circumstances.  Last year Mr. Jeyes indicated that Tusla needed investment of &euro;45 million just to stand still and it got &euro;34 million, but how has that impacted on Tusla?  How much does Tusla need in the next budget to implement the strategies Mr. Jeyes put to us in the presentation today?  It would appear that if Tusla does not get the funding, many of the strategies will not be implemented.<\/p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Jeyes mentions that 2,031 cases were deemed as high priority and are still waiting on a social worker.  This is an extremely high figure.  Previously, the Minister stated that every child deemed as high priority is allocated a social worker.  Can Mr. Jeyes provide a breakdown of the timeframe.  In terms of the 2,031, how long will they have to wait to be allocated a social worker?<\/p> <p>  He stated, in these graphs, that the total number of staff is down, from a high of 3,484 a year ago to 3,465.  I wonder what the ideal number should be.  I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#F00600","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Jeyes and his colleagues.  I welcome that we, as a committee, have put in train the process of holding quarterly meetings.<\/p><p>It is good for all of us to understand the issues and carry out our oversight role.  <br\/><br\/>The first area I wish to deal with is that of resources, which has been raised by my colleagues.  I am sure every State agency would say it needs additional resources, but I would place a priority on the Child and Family Agency.  Can Mr. Jeyes advise what would be the priority areas for the agency in obtaining additional resources so that we can understand the need for those resources?<br\/><br\/>In terms of the transfer of responsibilities, as was stated, we are 18 months into this operation.  Many of our systems, such as IT and human resources, are shared with the HSE.  I understand the human resources element is managed from Manorhamilton and that even a local transfer has to go to a national panel.  I am trying to understand the steps involved.  Also, with respect to the IT system, the transfer and the role the HSE was supposed to play, I wonder whether it comes back to the question: does Big Brother always win?  One of the reasons we wanted the Child and Family Agency established was to ensure it was independent and stood on its own.  What is the position with IT services?  <br\/><br\/>I have made my opinion clear on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAHMS; I believe it should have been transferred over.  There is a clear legal responsibility for the agency to provide a psychological service.  I cannot find evidence of a psychological service.  Has the HSE co-operated with Mr. Jeyes on that?  I would appreciate a response to that question.  It is important, because there is a legal responsibility for the agency to provide such a service.<br\/><br\/>Taking account of the number of children in care, we can get into issues about thresholds and whether the threshold has or has not increased for a child going into care.  I am not going to measure the agency on the number of children in care, but I would like to ensure, as we all would, that if a child needs care, care is there for the child and the agency has the necessary resources.  For me, it is a difficult indicator. <br\/><br\/>As other colleagues have asked, is Mr. Jeyes confident that he has resources required to implement the Children First Bill?  Does he have an overview of the plans in place for its implementation?  We will be dealing with the Children First Bill in the Seanad next week and it will be very useful to know that.  Have Mr. Jeyes engaged with other agencies regarding the implementation of the Children First legislation, including the HSE?  I asked the HSE about this several months ago and I believe it has one staff member responsible for Children First, which appalled me, given the number of children it deals with in its services.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the out-of-hours service, will it be a 24-hour service or will it only cover certain hours?  I wish to check that, as the figures for Childline show that the majority of its calls are made outside working hours. <br\/><br\/>With regard to homelessness and the housing crisis - I am not placing responsibility for addressing that issue on the agency - does Mr. Jeyes have a concern regarding child protection issues when children are placed in emergency accommodation?  That issue has been raised with the committee  by the Ombudsman for Children, and the ISPCC recently stated that the placement of children in emergency accommodation, particularly where communal areas may be shared outside the household, could present child protection issues.  What are the concerns of Mr. Jeyes in that respect and is he taking action to address any concerns he may have?<br\/><br\/>With regard to the funding of organisations, I am not questioning that he makes decisions, as he has to make decisions, but I would question the backdating of cuts.  I cannot stand over the announcement to organisations in May that their funding was to be cut from next January.  I understand that Mr. Jeyes must examine the streamlining of services, but we need to examine the way in which people have been communicated with and engaged, as organisations need to plan.<br\/><br\/>Another issue is the impact of policy.  The agency is trying to institute measures and make changes.  For example, a section 3 disclosure of abuse or neglect, which concerns alleged perpetrators, can have an impact on clients in practice.  There is the issue of the impact of that policy on staffing resources, and I appreciate the budget difficulties.  I note from the monthly performance indicators that staff are delivering more, which is welcome, but there is a limit to how far that can be stretched.  The elastic band is at full stretch.  I am trying to work out the impact this will have on children and on child protection.  I want to understand where those resources will go.  <br\/><br\/>On the issue of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and the legal costs, I have mixed feelings.  I agree that the system must be regulated but I have also seen the critical role that some guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>have played in children's lives and how they have intervened when the when the State has not been acting appropriately.  We often talk about the legal cost of providing a <i>guardian ad litem<\/i>, but I have a question about choices made by the Child and Family Agency in the cases  it chooses to bring to the court that are not mediated or dealt with at a lower level.  What responsibility is the agency taking for examining its own actions in regard to legal affairs, not only the costs involving other people?<br\/><br\/>It is good to see the 2015 business plan for the agency.  The five immediate priorities, which are part of the corporate plan, have been outlined and in respect of each of them a time period is indicated, such as &quot;short term&quot; or &quot;one to three years,&quot; but in the open comment it is stated that this is the progress in quarter one and quarter two.  Is everything listed there?  Is it the progress in quarter one and quarter two or is it in the short term, one to three years?  Mr. Jeyes know these plans inside out, but I am trying to establish what I am reading here to understand its significance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#F00700","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to be followed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who I know has to attend another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes for the presentation.

Resources involve taxpayers' money, not the Government's money, and we must make sure that there is a need for the provision of resources.  I am not saying that only to this group; it applies to every group that comes before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I understand it has been difficult and challenging to set up this organisation, and Mr. Jeyes certainly seems to have grasped the whole sector and pulled it together.  I am taken aback that he has only has two members of staff dealing with ICT and I note that they came from the National Education Welfare Board.  I presume he is not looking for 120 staff to manage estates with regard to the HSE.  I know of estates in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that the HSE owns.  We want money going into front-of-house staff, people who are dealing with children; we do not want to set up another big organisation employing people and still not dealing with children.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Jeyes about a matter, and this may be a different approach from that taken by other colleagues.  I am particularly interested in the agency's targeted range of family and parenting supports and its parenting strategy.  That is extremely important.  Will Mr. Jeyes outline his thinking on that strategy and how he will communicate with parents and help them do the best for their children, or, if they run into problems, where they can get advice?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes spoke about alignment of education and welfare services.  I presume that is for the children who drop out of school early or who are having psychological problems through school.  How will Mr. Jeyes reach into the schools?  I am aware that DEIS schools got all those services, while one could not get resources for such children in an ordinary mainstream school.  I am interested in that aspect.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes spoke about the agency's targeted range of family and parenting supports, including psychology services.  What psychology services are those?  For example, if a parent has a child who is diagnosed with autism and cannot get a service for their child, will the agency offer help and support in those circumstances?  Will it inform organisations that they are to take on that child and check why organisations are refusing children services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#G00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Jeyes and his colleagues and wish them well after 18 months of service in this area.

How accessible is it in terms of individual impact and will it be all-encompassing geographically?<\/p> <p>  There were some criticisms in the recent report from HIQA, specifically focusing on the north Dublin area, that investigation of allegations of physical abuse of children has been impeded by considerable delays on the part of Tusla in informing the Garda of the allegations.  This is something the Garda has said.  I note in the report that this matter has been satisfactorily addressed, according to HIQA.  I am aware of that in raising it, but I would like to hear an elaboration from Mr. Jeyes.

The report does not say that all these matters have been satisfactorily addressed.  Is he taking steps to ensure that cases of such seriousness are dealt with by those who have experience and competence?  The use of agency staff suggests a very temporary exposure, that staff would not have a longer engagement with the young person concerned or even with the particular case, when there is a need for consistency and continuity.  Would he comment on the appropriateness of using agency staff in such cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#H00100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Obviously there may be some overlap in the issues raised by members.  I will try to deal with some of it thematically, but no doubt I will be taken to task if I miss any points.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy began on the issue of investment and quite rightly identified that there was some catch-up in the second year of our establishment but not enough and, therefore, further adjustments had to be made.  I have told voluntary and community sector organisations that provide vital preventative work that they will remain vulnerable because if I have to fund more foster carers, I am going to do that, if I have to make sure there are allocated social-workers, I am going to do that, and, therefore, the bits of the budget that are more vulnerable will be cut if there is insufficient money to meet our existing level of service.<\/p> <p>  In terms of investment, we have made reductions this year in the region of some &euro;10 million.  We have closed the gap, but we have not done so sufficiently, and some of the savings we are making, not least through rigorous vacancy management on non-front-line posts, are not sustainable, that is, they will not recur next year.  Therefore, taking some recent Labour Court rulings regarding sleepovers and other matters into account, we are talking about &euro;25 million or so merely to stay where we are.  I am not saying that will be our end-of-year position - far from it - but that is when one takes into account unsustainable amounts and the fact that more children will be appropriately placed in foster care placements next year.  However, statistics show we have managed to improve performance in that because of people's goodwill, professionalism, dedication, and a better approach to prioritising.  We can evidence that and it is shown in the majority of - I accept not all - HIQA reports.<\/p> <p>  The other bit about immediate investment, which comes through other questions raised by Deputies, relates to capacity.  There is now clear evidence that we have insufficient capacity to do what is expected of us.  That is why, having looked at \"measure the pressure\", we have audited it further and I will come back to that, because Deputy Troy raised that later on.  All those issues relate to investment.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that Deputy Troy's next question was about legislation, because if the D&aacute;il passes legislation, that needs to be looked at to see its financial or priority implications.  If we are to do this and it is statutorily required, we must ask where it is funded from and what we are not going to do.  Much work has gone into preparing for Children First.  Child protection is everyone's responsibility and that is emphasised in terms of the organisation.  It is about spreading it.  Yes, there has been a detailed programme of us working with the health service, education, and local government, the major people who also work with children, and prioritising that work to ensure they are playing their part.  We are in correspondence with the Department and have been since the start of this.  It has a detailed submission for us to start up.  Clearly there will be an increase on the current 43,000 referrals we get and how we are staffed to ensure that is filtered and an efficient, effective and proportionate service is provided.  Yes, we can be ready for Children First.  The common societal commitment to child protection is welcome, but it comes with a modest additional resource tag on top of the standstill and capacity issues.<\/p> <p>  I apologise about anyone ever having to use a freedom of information request.  We do not want that.  If the information is there, we will make it available as quickly as possible.  By way of excuse, all I would say about \"measure the pressure\" is that we have been working on it to ensure it is validated and to ensure this estimate for staff is completely authentic.  We have produced a detailed audit of that to ensure the naming of the parts and the way in which we are measuring that intake system is the same throughout the country in order that the figures make sense.  We have completed that work.  I did not want to drown Deputies with paper, but if any Deputy wants a copy of that completed audit, they are welcome to it.  We now believe \"measure the pressure\" can and should be shared because it is validated, but I would not have said that before.  It is a lower figure than was previously reported for a variety of reasons - valid case closure, diverting it into community support and looking at things more carefully - but it shows we can now measure a capacity gap of around 5,000 cases.  We can state that it is insufficient.  It is not that nothing happens to them.  They are held by social workers on duty in intake.  They are monitored and prioritised, but there is still a gap.  I cannot deny that.  As a result of the work we have done with the trade union regarding a caseload that varies according to the type of work and the complexity of the case, there is a need, if we merely addressed it in the traditional way, for 220 to 250 social workers.<\/p><p>With regard to making information available, the fully integrated report for quarter one is published on our website today.  I will look into the issue of making more information readily available on the website in the normal way.  It is there and we would want to make it accessible.<\/p><p> I understand that whether it is being scrutinised here or in the media, there is an interest in knowing whether people are being held to account.  They are being held to account.  There are limits to transparency and sometimes sharing these things.  We believe in high support and rigorous challenge.  I have worked with groups of staff where disciplinary procedures have been put aside if people are prepared to engage in deep learning and acknowledge and sign up for responsibility.  What went wrong becomes a matter of learning.  Merely reverting to discipline is an easy way out; discipline would be too quick a solution.  The issues that went wrong in Laois are complex and many and to say it was just because of this or that, would be too easy.  Work continues on that and the initial emphasis has been on putting it right.<\/p><p> A number of members have mentioned ICT and I welcome the opportunity to speak about this.  It has already been picked up by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor and others that the in-house capacity for ICT is two staff, which is what EWS had.  There are approximately 250 to 260 staff in HSE-ICT but we never got any disaggregation from that figure.  The theory was that they would continue to provide us with a service, which they do, in terms of keeping our network going and putting the necessary Elastoplast on it.  However, in terms of developing the service and bringing up the strategy, it is wanting.  Both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are sympathetic but we need first of all, because it is an ICT expenditure, to get their permission to go to the market to get more support, such as ICT architects and others.  I believe we will get the investment and that is not my quibble, rather, it is about getting the specification right because getting it wrong can lead to further difficulties in getting sufficient resources to get on the front foot.<\/p><p> I do not want any of that translated as being critical of the HSE.  It has a very significant change agenda of its own in introducing e-health and other matters but inevitably, because our shared services are not in a customer relationship, I do not have cash or shares that I can trade in and it can all too easily look like a grace and favour relationship which, therefore, varies across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>How confident is Mr. Jeyes that he will be able to achieve his end aim, given what he has just said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I think we will but we in a bureaucratic circle in terms of the permissions we need from Departments to go to the market to get extra support to design a system and to build on the brown field site.

Deputy Mitchell O'Connor made the point about resources and I will deal with that again.  I have been in a leadership role in public services for 25 years.  It is always the case that elected members need to keep it under tight and rigorous control in order to give value to the taxpayer.  That will never stop so I welcome an open book.  HIQA reports have stated there are not enough resources at local level.  HIQA has stated it is interested in reporting on a national basis.  I have written to the chief executive of HIQA to say that I welcome such a report.  I want to know what categories it will examine and what criteria it will use.  I wish it to be seen to be the case that we have done very well on extra effort and extra hours and a great deal of willingness and professional support, but it is not sustainable.  I would be failing in my duty to the Government, having successfully taken us through the recessionary period, if I were not to provide that advice which I can substantiate.<br\/><br\/>On the point about Mullingar, there were no reductions in front line services for refugees.  There were ancillary reductions in counselling supports.  I will be happy to speak to the Deputy outwith.  A particular organisation receives resources from us for a number of features.  I deeply regret not being able to announce year reductions late in the year.  That was past practice, which I thought we had moved beyond.  It was unacceptable and I apologise.  We need to have clarity in our budget as soon as possible.  We need to ensure that we are clear and that we have had the necessary consultations so that we move forward and communicate far earlier than we managed last year.<br\/><br\/>I welcome Deputy Troy's interest in guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  He is quite correct that there needs to be systems of regulation.  It needs to go further than that, in my view.  There are those in the Judiciary who believe that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are clearly not party to the proceedings and, therefore, they should not, other than in very exceptional circumstances, have legal representation.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Mitchell O'Connor rightly asks what are we doing to put our own house in order.  Last year, we tidied up a lot of historical expenditures on other things.  Our legal expenditure was in the order of &euro;36 million.  This year it will be near to target of &euro;29 million.  Of that, more than 50% will be in guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>legal costs, each of which is increasing dramatically, in particular, the legal costs and guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It is a normal rule that if one has the chance to spend someone else's money, one is more profligate.  The accountability does not work and, therefore, we need to have a register of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, fixed payments and regulation.  The responsibility for it should have nothing to do with Tusla.  As Senator van Turnhout pointed out, guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>have a valuable job and a contribution to make, sometimes holding us to account.  Therefore, I cannot hold them to account.  The view that I can restrict their movements is not the case.  Therefore, any reform or any proposal on pay should not be part of our agency.  Accountability and pay, in my view, go together quite strongly.<br\/><br\/>Deputy McLellan asked about organisational structure.  We have a more consistent approach to aftercare.  We have the minimum guarantee but our legislative basis is for us to support the young people who are in full-time education or training.<\/p><p>We have to look at the other 32%, not least because of the pressures across Europe.  We have had very constructive discussions with the Department of Social Protection.  I think children and young people coming out of care should constitute a specific category, regardless of whether they are going back to their families or managing on their own resources.  This is happening across Europe.  The social protection system, on behalf of the State, should be identifying these young people.  If we are giving them an allowance from the State at that point, of course we should be making sure they understand that further or adult education and training are necessary for all of them.<\/p><p> This should not be rocket science.  If we work with the authorities that are responsible for housing and social protection to make sure these young people have the right resources, we can close the gap I have mentioned.  The small number of children and young people in this group want independence.  We can support them in that transition.  The Government will legislate to make the plans compulsory.  Once these young people become adults, responsibility for them lies with the relevant authorities in areas like education, health, housing and social protection.  There is no use in Tusla becoming a mere second-class service that props up these services.  That will not work.  We have specific responsibilities.  We need to increase our street workforce of aftercare workers and advisers who help young people when they get into difficulty.  Reference has been made to education and training.  We need to build better links with the school completion programme.<\/p><p> I would like to speak about the lack of consistency issue.  We are making progress in Louth-Meath, where different practices were adopted, relationship issues existed and the definition of a \"referral\" needed to be considered.  Those matters are being addressed, for example by making sure additional resources are provided, as was done in the midlands.  The issues in Louth-Meath were different from the issues in the midlands.  It is unfortunate that they arose at the same time.  There were particular unacceptable problems in Louth-Meath regarding recruitment and carrying too many vacancies.  We are taking positive action to reform that.<\/p><p> We think we need to come up with a budget formula that is based on the number of children in an area with a deprivation who are waiting.  We are having further discussions on what degree of weight to attach respectively to the density of urban poverty and the difficulties of rural circumstances, where sparsity or difficulty of accessing services can be additional costs.  These discussions are based on very good work that is being taken forward by the HSE.  It will be easier to introduce these systems as budgets start to improve modestly, which is what all of Ireland hopes will happen.  Some areas will flatline.  Areas that have fallen behind will benefit from increases.  It was extremely difficult at a time of declining budgets to introduce a new budget formula and move beyond past historic practice.  We had to say to people in area X or area Y, \"Everybody is losing and you will lose even more\".  Our work in this regard is a top priority.<\/p><p> I think we have covered the IT issues that were raised by Deputy McLellan.  We are proceeding with the national child care information system.  We wish to focus on areas that solely have a paper-based system at the moment.<\/p><p> With the exception of those services that have always been provided by Five Rivers, our out-of-hours services are not being outsourced.  Five Rivers was given a contract to make sure children in section 12 emergency situations were no longer being left in hospitals or police cells.  Its ability to act immediately was illustrated in a fairly recent case in Athlone, when a child was brought into care very quickly.  Progress will be made with the out-of-hours service now that agreement has been reached with IMPACT.  There will be rotas.  We will expand the crisis information service to ensure a phone line is available.  Eight contact points will be designated around the country.  Advice and support for local staff and institutions will be available.  We are now at the stage of seeking volunteers to get staff to identify themselves at a rate that is properly agreed with the unions.  I will be happy to provide a further update as that is taken forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Will it be a 24-hour service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#K00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Agreement on pay to meet the budget that was given to us within this has been achieved recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Will the out-of-hours service be a 24-hour service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#K00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>A telephone line will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but there will be a gap in the middle as we wait to determine the actual social work availability.

While that is a small step, culturally it is very significant for us.  That system will be available through Harcourt Street to all garda&iacute; and all emergency medical services.<\/p> <p>  Senator van Turnhout asked about resources.  I think the point to be made, other than the corporate point, is that as well as falling over the line in creating a new legal entity with no additional resources, we began from a low base post-Ryan.  While international comparisons are fraught with difficulty, by any international comparison we have fewer social workers.  We might have one social worker per 3,000 people.  The position is probably a bit worse than that.  I am familiar with other jurisdictions such as Scotland, which has one social worker per 1,000 people, and England, which has one social worker per 2,200 people.  There still needs to be investment, as I have already illustrated.  We can objectively quantify the level of current demand.  Now that we have audited and measured the pressures, we are having constructive discussions with the Department.<\/p> <p>  The education and welfare service officers do an excellent job, by any international comparison.  We have approximately 62 posts in this area.  The whole-time number is probably a bit lower than that.  The original estimate, which was based on an international comparison, was that we would have over 300 posts in this area.<\/p> <p>  I have already said I want some more managers.  I know it is a very hard sell to come here and talk about adding to the corporate layer.  It is a question of sustainability.  We have 4,000 staff, of whom 80, or 2% of the workforce, are managers at Grade 8 and above.  I think it is accepted within the HSE and by Tusla that human resources practices need reform.  Our human resources director is fully engaged with that.  We are exploring ways to take more of it in-house.

Discussions regarding psychology have not made as much progress as I would wish.  I will shortly write to the HSE to say I do not think we can take those discussions any further.

We need to work further and continue to be seen as more reliable, because Ireland still does not do permanency planning as well as it could.  A well-known children's rights advocate who is sometimes very critical of Tusla has described some of the courts as parents' rights courts.  There is a balance to this.  Now that the referendum is being homologated, I hope we are also taking account of the need for children to have their attachment areas and the need to give parents who are recovering from difficulties with alcohol or drugs, etc., time to recover.  We should not play \"in and out\" with children.  I think I have covered the points on Children First.<\/p><p>It is important that we focus on solving the initial issue affecting homeless children and children who are recently arrived migrants.  Children are best with their families, and whether it is a case of emergency accommodation or providing enough homes, the focus must be on this.  We are aware of the need to ensure that children in families dealt with by the Reception and Integration Agency are protected and in the right circumstances.  It is not right to put children in situations which make child protection difficult and then push another demand onto another Government agency.<br\/><br\/>The problem is section 3 and not our guidance.  We need a fundamental review of the 1991 Act to ensure the responsibilities of social workers entail social work and that investigatory responsibilities are Garda responsibilities.  We will take this forward in partnership.  I know of the concerns that many of my social work colleagues have about this, but the guidance is there to ensure fair process is followed and we do not get into expensive difficulties with the courts at a later stage.  We stand by this policy and guidance, while we are happy to contribute, as we do in a working group with the Department, to a full review of the 1991 legislation.<br\/><br\/>With regard to guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, we report mediation.

The leader I worked with in Cambridgeshire used to tell us not to come in waving shrouds.  We are not shroud waving.  We are happy to be objectively examined by whomsoever.  We have a duty to provide the service the D&aacute;il expects and value for the Irish taxpayer.  We provide a statutory service, and we need resources to meet expectations.  Of course there should be validation that what we say is accurate.  D&aacute;il Members, Departments and Ministers must make decisions based on knowledge.<br\/><br\/>It is very difficult to make the case for Ireland's most vulnerable children.  When something goes wrong we wring our hands, so I must make the case for those who are sometimes voiceless.  Issues in hospitals, schools and elsewhere are important, but from our history we know that so are the most vulnerable.  We have made progress, but unless there is investment we will slip down a snake, having climbed a small ladder.<br\/><br\/>The work of aligning education and welfare is important, because it is the same children who are affected.  We are making progress on this, not least in aligning under the Government's injunction school completion programmes, education welfare and home-school liaison.  We wish to put these together in a unified approach.  That is a start.<br\/><br\/>We do not have responsibility for children affected by disability, and this includes autism.  We need to be clear and effective in what we do so as not become a secondary service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#K01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The parenting strategy Mr. Jeyes mentioned-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will allow the Deputy to speak at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinlan will answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The parenting strategy has been developed and published on our website and is available.

As we put in place the final plans I will be happy to provide them.  I have every confidence in the hard-working staff and leadership in north Dublin. We have been in existence for 18 months and the report stated that the progress in improving our partnership with the Garda has been impressive over the past 12 months.  Some of the initial publicity whereby attention was drawn to half a paragraph of criticism and not the improvement was unfortunate.  Our partnership with the Garda is good and needs to remain steady.  It always needs to be monitored.  Delays are unacceptable.  The issue of physical abuse is particularly interesting with regard to how it fits into our multicultural policy in ensuring families understand the standards expected of them.  We have been working with the immigrant family support unit and others to improve our understanding and cultural diversity training and we work with the agents of these communities locally.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin, although not necessarily in the rest of the country, turnover is quite high.  The average age of those in the social work profession is lower than elsewhere.  As well as working on recruitment, we must work on retention, and getting the agency fully staffed will assist with this.  We do not always know what case will be complex when we start it.  As was rightly said, we want to have supervision.  The north Dublin report stated that supervision was good, governance was strong, management was experienced and oversight was present, as well as stating the areas for development.  In these circumstances, I am confident that new social workers and those returning to the profession are getting support.  We are a service under pressure and sometimes this support and nurturing can suffer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Mr. Jeyes stated that legal costs would still be in the region of &euro;29 million this year, which is 50%-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00700","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>More than 50% will go on guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Jeyes is happy with the legal fees?

We have de-escalated and need to make sure the same happens on the other side, as it is not necessary.  It is not a legal matter; it is a question of the balance of probabilities in the interests of the child.  I also believe the oversight, wisdom and compassion of the Judiciary are required.

We think the capacity gap is in the region of 5,000, to whom we are not allocating full-time teams as quickly as we would like.  The 500 investigations into allegations of abuse should be dealt with in a more specialist way.  To do all of this, discussions are ongoing in the Department.

I have had the honour of being proposed for re-appointment as chair of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  I am a doctor, a graduate of Trinity and a registered specialist in public health with the Irish Medical Council.  I trained in Dublin and then in Yorkshire, before coming back to Ireland in 1997.  I have worked as an academic since then, for ten years in UCD and for the last eight in DCU where I am the professor of health systems in the school of nursing and human sciences.  I have qualifications in medicine, epidemiology, public health, education and board governance.<\/p> <p>  I am an applied public health researcher, that is, my work is mostly directed to specific, immediately applicable ends.  I have done a lot of academic work on specific types of cancer, namely, leukaemias and lymphomas, and have worked closely with many Irish haematologists as part of this.  My more recent work has been on the delivery of services.  I have worked on resource allocation for the Irish health services.  I have spent much of the last two years working on a draft strategy for ICT in the Health Service Executive.  I have worked, and led, EU-funded projects including several major projects on child health and environmental health.<\/p> <p>  Very relevant to this session, I worked for the national blood strategy implementation group and did the fieldwork and analysis of blood use in Ireland for the report which came out in 2004.  I also worked closely with the IBTS, and in particular with the medical director and the then operations manager, to look at stock management in the Irish blood services.  This work was funded from 2004 to 2007 by the health research board and the Department of Health and Social Security in Northern Ireland.  I was asked to serve as chair of the IBTS a little over three years ago.  The invitation was unexpected but I felt that I would have something to offer the organisation, both because of my prior detailed knowledge of the practice and policy on blood use in Ireland and because of my organisational and leadership skills.<\/p> <p>  I was very conscious of my limited board experience and I have taken every opportunity to improve my skills in this area, including attending board induction sessions and training sessions at the Institute of Public Administration.  I am now coming to the end of the Institute of Directors chartered director program, which includes formal training in governance, board performance, strategic planning and general management.<\/p> <p>  When I came into the post, my board colleagues and I were very clear on our core mission, to provide a safe, secure and reliable blood supply to the people and the health service of Ireland.  The tragic history of the infection of many Irish blood product recipients by the Blood Transfusion Service Board will be familiar to members and I assure them it is always to the forefront of my mind.<\/p> <p>  The IBTS is, among other things, one of the largest voluntary organisations in Ireland.  We have donors from almost every parish in the country and a network of local voluntary organisers who support our collection teams in running donation clinics all over the country and in persuading local people to attend.  The care of our donors is also a high priority for us.  I have the privilege and the very great pleasure of making awards to donors who have donated 50 and 100 times at a series of award dinners held around the country.  Our donors are remarkable people and every time I meet them I become more convinced of this.<\/p> <p>  On taking on the role over three years ago, my colleagues and I identified two big issues which had to be dealt with.  Both were of practical significance to the organisation and both took a large proportion of both board time and executive time.  The first of these was the Cork centre.  A debate had gone on for 12 years with no final resolution as to the nature and needs of our Cork centre.  Now, thanks to a great deal of work from our own executive, colleagues in the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Cork University Hospital-UCC medical school, an agreement has been reached, and approved by the Minister, to develop a new centre on the CUH site in Cork.  This will be a major new laboratory facility, supporting both our own staff's very specialised work with the most complex transfusion cases and the transfusion work now being done by other hospital laboratories in Cork.  There will be a donor collection centre, a major blood stock holding centre with one half of the Irish blood stock, and facilities for platelet collection and plasma apheresis.<\/p> <p>  The second issue was the IBTS pension fund.  This is a public sector pension fund but it is run by the IBTS.  In common with many other private sector pension funds it is running a deficit.  This deficit arises from several sources, such as changes in demography, low bond yields, and the recent recession.  This is a major issue for our staff and it inhibits the transfer of staff from the IBTS to equivalent posts in HSE.  After a great deal of work, and with immense support from the Department of Health, we believe that the pension fund issue may be close to resolution and that a fair and equitable solution respecting the rights of our staff, our current pensioners, and our parent Department can be reached.  Active work continues on this.  Joint agreement from our parent Department and DPER is required.<\/p> <p>  The pension fund is driving a steadily increasing deficit in the IBTS.  Our core business is paying for itself, but the requirement to continue funding pension fund deficits, currently of the order of between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million a year, is destabilising our finances.  Despite extensive cost-cutting, and reductions in headcount, we now need either to sharply increase the cost of our products, or to achieve a reasonable resolution to the pension fund.<\/p> <p>  Another very important piece of work, which took a good deal of time, was the preparation of a full business continuity plan for the IBTS.  This is our contingency plan for any incident threatening our ability to provide a safe and secure blood supply, up to and including the complete destruction of the National Blood Centre.<\/p><p>This has been a very large change project, including moving to single site testing and processing, developing and testing and service level agreements with our suppliers and our international partners to ensure continuity of supply.  There were two other important managerial projects delivered over this time.  The first was a move to full activity based costing.  Unlike most public bodies, and, indeed, many private sector providers, the IBTS can now accurately cost our services.  A second major change project was the introduction of a new IT system to the organisation.  This has taken a little over three years to set up and establish, and is due to go live later this summer.  Thanks are due to our staff, executive and parent Department for their hard work and support on these major changes.<\/p><p> We have one major challenge, that is, the declining use of blood products.  Over the last few years the use of red cells and platelets, our main products, has fallen sharply, by around 13% over the last five years.  Incidentally, this is desirable and is something we want to happen.  It is hard to know what the optimum level of blood product use is, but Ireland was using more product per head than many of our peers four years ago.  We are now using product at a level comparable to that of the best-performing EU countries.  <\/p><p> Managing the impact of this on our bottom line has been a real challenge.  In common with other public sector bodies, our budget and head count have fallen sharply over the last four years.  The additional challenge of falling sales has been difficult to manage.  As far as we can see, the decline in blood product usage has now levelled out.  We expect that it will begin to rise slightly over the next four or five years, due to an aging population and the expected increase in hospital activity.<\/p><p> The IBTS must have sufficient funds to continue to invest in staff training, equipment maintenance and upgrades and responding to new technologies and challenges.  We are now living on past investments.  It will be necessary to make further investments in new testing and product preparation methods over the next five years, and we do not currently have the resources to do this.  <\/p><p> There are two specific challenges facing us.  The first is specific.  There is a human virus known as hepatitis E.  This virus is spread from pigs and undercooked pork meat products, but it can be also be spread through blood transfusion.  The illness caused is mild, but people who are immunosuppressed, for example transplant recipients such as myself, or people with cancer, may be at greater risk of long-term illness.  A test for this virus is now available, and we need to make a decision on how to bring this test into routine use and how to fund it.<\/p><p> The second is a longer-term, and more strategic, challenge.  As well as blood products, we currently provide a limited number of tissue services, mostly valves for heart surgery and corneas for transplants, and a small number of other tissues, as well as a new service for limbal stem cells used in the repair of serious eye injuries.  These services will become more important over time.  At the current time stem cell treatments are prepared in five or six places in the Republic.  It is hard to argue that this represents the best use of public money.  There is a strong economic case, and perhaps a patient safety and quality case, for these services to be further developed on one site.  The IBTS is keen to contribute to this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony Staines","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Staines and compliment him on his excellent CV and list of publications and research funding.

We wish him well and continued success in his role on the board of the IBTS.<\/p><p>Among the priority issues he signalled today, I ask Professor Staines over the next number of years to address the matter of the prospective use, rather than disposal, of blood provided by those suffering from haemochromatosis.  He indicated a personal situation in his presentation, namely, himself, and I include myself in that.  I am a former voluntary blood donor, who had a silver pelican and wanted to do better.  It transpired that I had haemochromitotis which involves retaining too much iron in the blood.  People buy iron supplements from pharmacies up and down the country, when a couple of pints of what I am carrying around with me would do them a world of good.  It is beyond my comprehension why such blood is not employed by the health service, as it is in other countries, including in the United States and elsewhere where no differentiation is made.  Many of us who attend for venesections and phlebotomy from time to time find it is part of the discourse for an ever-growing number of Irish people because it has a more significant presence among our number than in other nationalities.  It is prevalent among the Irish and Scottish.  It is suggested it is a footprint in the sand of our genealogical make up going back in time.<\/p><p>I am interested in hearing what Professor Staines has to say about it and whether he has any views at this point in time.  If not, I would encourage him to examine the issue because it is a matter of considerable concern that the blood we give, which is of more than usable quality, is simply disposed of - I understand it is incinerated.<\/p><p>I refer to the other area of interested highlighted by Professor Staines, namely, the developing range of products the IBTS currently provides.  I would not have known but for the presentation today that the IBTS has moved into other tissue services such as valves for heart surgery, corneas for transplants, a small number of other tissues and the new service for limbal stem cells.  How long has this other area of development been <i>in situ<\/i>?  Was the IBTS the perceived appropriate vehicle to provide these additional needs in terms of transplant services?  I would agree that if this is an area in which the IBTS is involved it will most definitely be an area of greater focus and interest in the future.  Perhaps Professor Staines might elaborate on that.<\/p><p>Is it the case that for those who make the decision to donate body tissues on the expiry of life corneas are removed and the IBTS is the receiving body for their allocation to others who will benefit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#O00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#O00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will close to give the Senator a brief moment before he runs helter-skelter to make it to the Seanad Chamber.

My second issue concerns haemochromatosis, to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred.  I met a GP in the Cork area, who had also met the IBTS, regarding the cost of people with haemochromitosis going into hospital and having blood taken which is sent for incineration.  I understand the GP concerned has worked with the IBTS about rolling out a service whereby GP would provide the same service as it provided in hospitals, but there seems to be a problem with getting the HSE on board.  Can some progress be made on the matter?<\/p> <p>  I understand funding was sought from UCC to conduct a research project on cutting costs.  The cost to provide the service in CUH is approximately &euro;300 per person, whereas GPs could roll it out at a cost of about &euro;100 per visit.

I was, however, interested in what was said about it.<\/p> <p>  One thing I know about is blood products and blood donors.  I am not a donor because of a previous long-term illness because of which I cannot give blood.  I would have liked to do so, but, unfortunately, I had an illness when I was a child.  I have just spent two weeks in the children's hospital with my grandson who has been there for a while and I was fascinated by the scenario in young children receiving blood.  I was speaking to the parent of a little baby who had such a rare disease that he could only receive blood of a certain type.

I thank him for his kind words.  It was very nice of him to say it.  He is absolutely right about haemochromatosis.  It is one of the issues I raised the first time I met the medical director on taking over as chairman.  He and I both felt what we were doing was foolish because we were taking blood from people and throwing it away.  We have set up two clinics, one in Dublin and the other in Limerick, and will be setting up further ones, at which we provide a service where we take blood from a person who needs a venesection which is typically prescribed by his or her general practitioner or consultant.  If the person is eligible to donate - everyone is not suitable for the reasons tow which Deputy Catherine Byrne alluded - he or she can choose to do so.  It is entirely a free choice for the individual.  If he or she chooses to become a donor, we will take his or her blood, test, treat and process it, just like everybody else's.  If he or she chooses not to donate, we will take blood in a special bag in order that there can be no possibility of error and dispose of it.  Our objective this year is to roll out the service to all of our donor clinics.  We have a new IT system which will I hope be installed next month.  Once it is working and has bedded down, we hope people with haemochromatosis will be able to donate anywhere in the country and at any routine donor clinic.  We are collecting quite an amount of blood in D'Olier Street, Limerick and Stillorgan from people with haemochromatosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony Staines"},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Without charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#P00500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437125400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes.  We are negotiating with the HSE on how we can be paid for it.  If we take blood from people who are not donors, there is a significant cost to us.  We are negotiating with the HSE on who pays for it.  On the whole we would prefer if the HSE paid for it.  We are much cheaper than hospitals because it is the only thing we do.  It takes a significant load off the hospitals.  As such, haemochromatosis consultants are keen that we deploy the service further and faster.  That is our objective.  We have started, but we have a way to go yet.<\/p> <p>  The second issue referred to was the product mix.  We started almost by accident - I think 30 years ago - because somebody was needed to mind heart valves that were being used for heart surgery.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board seemed to have the right set of skills and we started by accident, but it has always been a very small scale part of our activities.  It has expanded a little during the years, but our view is that tissue and stem cell services will probably expand substantially in the next decade.  There is a need for a strategic conversation on how best to meet that need.  We are a highly regulated manufacturer of bio-pharmaceuticals; that is what blood transfusion is about.  As such, we have certain skills to bring to the table.  However, we are not saying we should do it.  That might be how it will end up, but for the moment we are saying we should have a conversation nationally about what is the right, the most effective and safest way to do it for our service and patients.  We wish to contribute to that conversation.<\/p> <p>  There has been a very long, drawn-out discussion about Cork centres.  In fact, it started when I came back to Ireland in 1997 and we have been around the houses several times.  The final upshot is that we have reached agreement with the Department, Cork University Hospital, CUH, and UCC which are the relevant parties.  We have a facility at St. Finbarr's Hospital which really needs to be rebuilt.  It is located in prefabricated buildings and no longer fit for purpose.  We have arranged with CUH to build it on a site there.  I am told the project team is meeting this month.  CUH appointed its delegate to the project team three or four days ago and I gather the plan is to meet this month.  We will proceed to planning as swiftly as possible.  All going well, we hope to go to planning by Christmas.  That is our objective.  What we will end up with is a single transfusion centre in Cork in which we will undertake very complex transfusions in which our staff specialise.  That is one of the reasons we want to keep the centre in Cork.  It is a huge asset to Cork University Hospital which is a very large haematological centre.  We will also be able to support the more day-to-day transfusion work.  It will allow us to provide our specialised services at a reasonable cost.  The service we are providing is not viable as we have quite a number of staff who do not have enough routine work to do to pay their salaries.  However, we need the staff to provide the on-call complex transfusion service.  This will be a much more stable solution.  In the longer term there will be a very good blood centre in Cork providing what we hope will be a really good service for the people of the south and south west.  That is our objective.<\/p> <p>  In reducing the use of blood, there are two sayings in the transfusion business.  One is that the most dangerous transfusion is the one you do not need.  Giving people blood products is inherently unsafe.  There are inherent risks.  Our job is to reduce these risks to the lowest possible level.  I have had approximately 130 blood transfusions and 100 platelet and plasma transfusions and been at the sharp end of this.  We believe our blood products as safe as we can make them, but there is a limit to how safe one can make them.  On the other hand, the next most dangerous blood transfusion is the one you do not have when you need it.  Doctors always tread a line between giving blood too freely and not giving enough.  I did some work for the national blood strategy implementation group in 2003 and note that in the past doctors used to prescribe two, four or six units of blood.  Now, the most common prescription is for a single unit, which is probably right.  We understand much better that raising a person's haemoglobin level does not do a huge amount.  People can function quite well on a low haemoglobin level and raise their own as they recover after surgery or suffering a trauma.<\/p><p>People are therefore using less blood.  We already know that as the population ages, the number of cancer cases will go up.  A lot of our blood is used by people with cancer, so we expect that over the next decade the demand for blood will rise again.  Our demand for blood was quite high by European standards, whereas it is now low by European standards and will probably go up a bit. <\/p><p> I was trying to explain to one of our new board members, who came from a stockbroker's, why it was in our interest as a trading organisation to reduce demand for our product.  It took her a while to get her head around it, but she understood it.  Part of our remit is to manage blood use effectively across the country.  We have set up a national transfusion committee, which is chaired by one of our consultants.  That is designed to provide guidance, advice and training on the proper and effective use of blood and blood products.  That is our objective.<\/p><p> Hepatitis E is a fairly new virus.  We are struggling to explain it because when people hear \"hepatitis virus\" they tend to think of hepatitis C, which is the one that caused such devastation from the anti-D that we produced, I am ashamed to say.  The hepatitis E virus is relatively newly identified.  It causes a disease much more like what used to be called juvenile or infant hepatitis, which is hepatitis A.  It tends to be mild and almost everybody gets better.  I am not saying it is negligible, it is not.  However, it is not nearly as serious as hepatitis B or C.  One can get it from pork and it is commoner where they eat a lot of pork sausages, salamis and hams.  People who work with pigs are inclined to get infected by this virus and one can transmit it in blood.<\/p><p> A test has been available only since Christmas 2014.  We have done a lot of preliminary work on how and who to test.  We are now discussing how much it will cost with the Department because we do not have enough money in our own resources to do it.  We are having a discussion with the Department of Health about the most effective model for testing and we hope to introduce it in the next while.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about donors and kids.  A small number of people require multiple transfusions, and a number of them are children.  We provide those transfusions.  There might be eight or ten donors who donate to those children in Ireland.  We take blood from those people and earmark it for those children.  We have quite a sophisticated patient-centred process around a relatively small number of children.  These are the complex transfusions I was mentioning.  We also get complex transfusion problems in adults.  We often have matched donors, so we have the information.  We have detailed blood groups which go on for about half a page on a large number of people.  We draw from those and also work with colleagues abroad to meet some specialised requirements.  <\/p><p> The last issue mentioned was the lifetime deferral for men who have sex with men.  At the moment, our policy is that if a man has had sex with a man, he is deferred from donating for life.  This policy was introduced in the early 1980s at the time of the Aids epidemic.  Different blood services across Europe now have a range of different policies.  Some of them have a lifetime deferral policy, while some have a deferral for two or five years.  Some services have a policy which says they are interested in a person's sexual history.  They are essentially interested if a person has had sex with a new partner recently, because that is where the risk arises.<\/p><p> The issue that arises is that there is a window period between the time one becomes infected with something and the time our test can detect it.  The window period is very short - it is six to seven days - but it is not zero.  Therefore, there is a small risk that if a person was just infected with HIV, hepatitis B, and we took blood from them in all innocence our test could miss that the person had been infected.  We might give that blood to somebody else and the risk of transmission there is not negligible.  <\/p><p> We have reviewed the policies across Europe.  We are part of a European group of bloodbanks and have had discussions with members of that group.  Our chief executive is the vice-president of that group at the moment.  We are doing a very detailed risk assessment.  We have done the first draft of it and are now going to prepare the second draft.  We hope it will be finished in the autumn of this year.  At that time, we will bring the draft to our board and to the Department.  The discussion will be about our policy and the risk, as well as a couple of other policies and how they will change the risk.  We will have to make a decision as to what is the safest policy for our donors and recipients, and what is the fairest policy for all the people in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015071700002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony Staines","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437125400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Has there been much engagement with organisations like GLEN?
