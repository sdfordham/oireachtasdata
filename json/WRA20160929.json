The next valuation date would have fallen on 1st November 2016.  During the passage of the Finance Bill in 2014 I gave a firm commitment that my Department would examine the LPT and any impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I asked Dr. Don Thornhill to conduct a review to consider and make recommendations on the operation of the Local Property Tax, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments. <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax.  His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In my Budget 2016 statement,\u00a0I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gave sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers\u00a011 and\u00a012 respectively).\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.

This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there are also certain more explicit flexibility provisions within the rules, particularly with a view\u00a0to encouraging public investment.\u00a0\u00a0These take the form of what is known as the investment clause and structural reform clause.\u00a0 Specifically, these provisions allow for temporary deviations from\u00a0the required structural\u00a0budgetary adjustment if spending on\u00a0capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause\u00a0or the structural reform clause.  Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while\u00a0Ireland has not\u00a0yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant\u00a0review by my officials.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is\u00a0very conscious of the need to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.\u00a0 Investment in public infrastructure is vital for the medium and long-term competiveness of the economy as well as for underpinning social cohesion through the provision of vital services to people in the form of schools, public transport, housing, etc.  The public capital plan provides for &euro;42 billion of capital investment over the 2016-2021 period and the Government remains committed to this. \u00a0Further to this\u00a0the Government\u00a0set out\u00a0in the SES\u00a0proposals an additional cumulative &euro;5.1 billion in capital spending over the period 2017-2021.

When expressed as a percentage of GDP, there is a small\u00a0decline to\u00a024.4%\u00a0from\u00a025.9%.  These forecasts take account of &euro;2.54 billion of fiscal space allocated to proposed tax reductions to be implemented over this period.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that forecast tax revenues from 2016 to 2021\u00a0remain relatively flat\u00a0as a\u00a0share of GDP, whereas the forecast for appropriations-in-aid\u00a0drops by over 1%\u00a0of\u00a0GDP over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 80% of the current appropriations-in-aid for 2016 relate to the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund.  The Social Insurance Fund is funded by PRSI receipts.  With both\u00a0funds in surplus, the gross expenditure and appropriations-in-aid for the funds are assumed to net off in arriving at the Exchequer Balance.  Additional revenue forecast for both funds\u00a0for the period to 2021 is then reflected in the General Government Balance.  If the surplus receipts in these funds were included in the forecast of receipts in table 3 of the Summer Economic Statement, the overall estimate of appropriations-in-aid, as a percentage of GDP, would have reduced only slightly from 2016 to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of fiscal space in the Summer Economic Statement is consistent with the Programme for Partnership Government (PfPG) which outlines a split of at least two-to-one in favour of expenditure.  This reflects the priority the Government attaches to re-growing\u00a0public expenditure in a sustainable way while also addressing the need to reward work and support enterprise and employment.<\/p>  <p>  In the PfPG,\u00a0there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of public infrastructure, the Government is conscious of the need to increase capital expenditure in order to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.  The public capital plan, published in September 2015, provided for &euro;42 billion of capital investment out to 2021 and the PfPG\u00a0contained a commitment not only to protect this level of investment, but to increase it by a further &euro;4 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The level of capital expenditure provided for in the Summer Economic Statement allows for an additional &euro;5.14 billion over the 2017 to 2021 period in excess of the additional &euro;4 billion commitment given in the Programme.  This emphasises the importance the Government places on continued investment in the public infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, the Government is prioritising infrastructural investment in order to support and broaden the economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900046#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Registration","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900046#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[27555\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900046#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the tax system would be fairer if self-employed persons were allowed to earn a modest income before registering for VAT, as the current threshold of &euro;37,500 turnover does not equate to that sum in income, and that this threshold could be interpreted as problematic.","asker":"1291","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The registration thresholds is a special scheme for small enterprises.

The VAT thresholds were increased to their current values on 1 May 2008.  As the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase the thresholds.

Currently, Ireland is required to improve its structural balance by 0.6 per cent of GDP per annum. My Department's\u00a0latest forecasts, as published in the Summer Economic Statement, indicate that Ireland will achieve a structural balance improvement of 0.5 percentage points this year.

Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed solely by looking at standard variable rate mortgages and any overall assessment of mortgage rates would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing for different aspects of the overall mortgage market.  Nevertheless, as the Deputy is aware, the issue of standard variable mortgage rates is a significant one for this Government and it has made\u00a0it clear that it is not acceptable for lenders to charge excessive rates\u00a0on residential mortgages. <\/p><p>On\u00a0my request the Central Bank produced a report on this issue entitled, 'Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland'.  You will find this report available at the following link: .  This research identified three main reasons for higher mortgage interest rates in Ireland.  Firstly, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  As indicated, profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks and thereby make a positive contribution to the overall economy.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be\u00a0aware, I had a series of formal\u00a0meetings with the main mortgage lenders last year where I outlined the Government's opinion that the standard variable rate being charged, to both existing and new Irish mortgage customers, was too high.  The banks have since reviewed their rates and subsequently reduced them which has been evidenced in\u00a0the latest\u00a0Central Bank statistical release on retail interest rates\u00a0for July\u00a02016.  Nevertheless, this is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will keep under active review in our ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>The Government is of the opinion that real competition among lenders is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole without giving rise to potentially unforeseen and undesirable consequences for new mortgage lending.  In line with this general approach, the Programme for a Partnership Government indicates that the Government will take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider to be administered by the Central Bank of Ireland and also requesting the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  Therefore, the primary policy approach of this Government in this area\u00a0is to develop an overall banking policy that encourages more entrants and a vibrant banking sector with real competition in order to provide more choice to mortgage holders.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases were borrowers could make savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900052#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900052#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[28004\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900052#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that all economic indicators remain stable and consistent with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>Recent indicators have generally been positive, indicating that the economic recovery is continuing in a sustainable manner.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>GDP grew by 4.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year on an annual basis.

In addition, existing schools may themselves, as a matter of routine, arrange for water testing to be carried out without recourse to my Department.  <\/p><p>Since 2011 to date, issues have arisen with drinking water quality in 10 schools that required remediation works.  The Department carried out testing and remediation works at 8 schools which are located in North Dublin.  A building Contractor carried out testing and remediation works in the other 2 schools which are in County Meath.<\/p><p>My Department is currently funding the provision of bottled water at 2 of the North Dublin Schools and the 2 Meath Schools.<\/p><p>Various remedial works were carried out at each of the 8 North Dublin schools.  The water has been declared safe to drink by the Local Authority at 6 of the schools.  Works at the other 2 schools are now complete and resampling and final testing is awaited before the schools can avail of drinking water.  The total cost of remediation works across the 8 schools where remediation has been completed amounted to &euro;474,000 including VAT.<\/p><p>In the 2 Meath schools, testing was carried out on completion of a building project which revealed exceedances of copper.  However, this was remediated and paid for by the contractor for the building project and re-testing now shows that the drinking water supply is negative for copper.  While there is no imperative for my Department to carry out further works it has arranged for additional remediation works to be undertaken to fully address the concerns of the schools and bottled drinking water is being provided pending the completion of these works.<\/p><p>The 8 North Dublin schools were constructed over 5 years ago and the 2 Meath schools were constructed within the last 2 years.<\/p><p>The average monthly cost of providing bottled water for the 2 North Dublin schools amounted to &euro;383 for the duration of the remedial works period.

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.<\/p><p>Article 7 of the regulations states that each habitable room must contain a permanently fixed appliance or appliances capable of providing effective heating and that there are suitable and adequate facilities for the safe and effective removal of fumes and other products of combustion to the external air.<\/p><p>Article 13 provides that installations for the supply of gas shall be maintained in good repair and safe working order. There is no requirement under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended, for landlords to carry out an annual service of home heating boilers.<\/p><p>Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;32 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections have been carried out in this period.<\/p><p>Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations.

This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.<\/p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group, to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as Motor Tax payments and a basic payment account.<\/p><p>The Government is therefore taking a range of measures to support the post office network to adapt to the changed business environment in which it operates. The network will, however, continue to operate within the context of An Post&rsquo;s commercial mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP01750"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[27846\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will assess the budget submission from Nexus Arts (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>My Department has received this submission and it is being considered.

In addition, a further &euro;6.158 million is provided for 2016 by way of a capital carry-over.<\/p>  <p>  A key driver of the increase in funding for the arts and in cultural expenditure in my Department in 2016 is the ongoing Commemorations Programme.  The allocation in 2016 is almost &euro;49 million, including &euro;31 million in capital and &euro;18 million in current expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The capital allocation of almost &euro;31 million for commemorations, supplemented by &euro;6.158 million in carryover from 2015, has provided for a number of flagship projects or permanent reminders that are being progressed this year.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for 2016 has also supported projects which form part of the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme.  In addition, the major refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland continues in 2016 as well as an investment of more than &euro;39 million this year in our national cultural institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The important and valuable work of the Arts Council has also been recognised.  This is reflected in the 2016 current allocation of more than &euro;60 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million over the 2015 allocation.  Funding of &euro;5.5 million is provided in 2016 for Culture Ireland, which includes &euro;3 million for \"I am Ireland\", or \"Mise &Eacute;ire\", the Culture Ireland international programme that forms part of the Ireland 2016 centenary programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I assure the Deputy that I am engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and budgetary processes.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy's reference to a figure of 0.6% of GDP is an extrapolation from a Council of Europe research project called Compendium - Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe.  Compendium collects figures on expenditure on culture in some European countries.  I understand that many European countries including ten EU member states are not included in the figures.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.  Apparently the Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, artists exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are all examples of elements not included in the Council of Europe figures for Ireland but included in the figures for some other countries.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I consider that further research on this issue is warranted.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft Framework Policy &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach\/Culture 2025 which I forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP02150"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[27875\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will prioritise investment in community and home-based care for persons suffering with Alzheimer's disease in budget 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.<\/p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;<\/p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;<\/p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.<\/p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefited under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 85 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450 Home Care Packages and 130 Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.   A further 60 clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  While the proposal from the Alzheimer Society will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates exercise for 2017, at this stage I cannot predict what the outcome of that consideration will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900059#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescriptions Charges","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900060#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[28015\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092900060#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost in 2017 and in a full year of reducing the prescription levy by 25%, 50% and 75% and of eliminating it altogether.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>The estimated cost of reducing the medical card prescription charge by 25%, 50% and 75% is set out in the following table.

It would not be\u00a0appropriate\u00a0to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while\u00a0a major public\u00a0procurement process is underway . I do not intend therefore to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters. Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.<\/p><p>On 29 September 2015, the Government's 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery<\/i>, was published.  It\u00a0includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  This allocation provides the <i>initial<\/i>stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available\u00a0over the lifetime of any contract(s).  Funding of &euro;75m is committed through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). <\/p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is\u00a0engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an\u00a0invitation to bidders to submit\u00a0detailed draft proposals,\u00a0the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. <\/p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders\u00a0will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.<\/p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear. <\/p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP . It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and \/ or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. <\/p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I\u00a0 established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Task force\u00a0will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the task force will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.

The projects that were the subject of my announcement earlier this month were all approved at this maximum 75% aid rate.<\/p><p>As the Deputy has indicated, the EU Guidelines provide that, in certain limited circumstances, an aid rate exceeding 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances for airports with traffic volume below 1 million passengers per annum.  In such a scenario, the EU Commission have indicated that a business case, justifying the proposed higher aid rate, would have to be approved by them. <\/p><p>Clearly, the EU Commission view any support above the 75% level as an\u00a0exception, rather\u00a0than the norm. <\/p><p>I believe that having the public purse pick up the tab for three-quarters of the cost of airport investments removes a considerable\u00a0financial burden from our regional airports and it is not unreasonable that these airport companies should fund the balance from their own resources.<\/p><p>I am aware, however, that IWAK has indicated that, even with the maximum level (75%) of capital support allowed for under the EU Guidelines, they believe that they will be unable to finance their two major upcoming projects &ndash; an apron extension and an overlay of the runway.

The projects that were the subject of my announcement earlier this month were all approved at this maximum 75% aid rate.<\/p><p>As the Deputy has indicated, the EU Guidelines provide that, in certain limited circumstances, an aid rate exceeding 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances for airports with traffic volume below 1 million passengers per annum.  In such a scenario, the EU Commission have indicated that a business case, justifying the proposed higher aid rate, would have to be approved by them. <\/p><p>Clearly, the EU Commission view any support above the 75% level as an\u00a0exception, rather\u00a0than the norm. <\/p><p>I believe that having the public purse pick up the tab for three-quarters of the cost of airport investments removes a considerable\u00a0financial burden from our regional airports and it is not unreasonable that these airport companies should fund the balance from their own resources.<\/p><p>I am aware, however, that IWAK has indicated that, even with the maximum level (75%) of capital support allowed for under the EU Guidelines, they believe that they will be unable to finance their two major upcoming projects &ndash; an apron extension and an overlay of the runway.  My Department has indicated to IWAK that we will support the making a case to the EU Commission to permit a 90% aid rate for\u00a0these two\u00a0planned major projects.<\/p><p>I should also mention that under the Public Policy Remit Capital (PPR-C) Scheme of the Regional Airports Programme, former Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe announced &euro;1.2m in funding last April for the four regional airports.  The PPR-C Scheme caters for projects and operations at the airports which are generally obligatory under national or international aviation requirements and which involve costs for the airports that generate no economic return (e.g. Air Traffic Control, fire services, security services, etc).

The aim of the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in 13 areas of disadvantage in Ireland to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty.

While the National evaluation of the ABC programme will not be complete until 2018, the Department is currently reviewing the emerging learning from the programme in terms of design and implementation and having regard to most recent developments in our own policy domain and in other related areas.
