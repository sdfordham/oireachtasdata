I reiterate our commitment to serving rural Ireland and connecting the people in these communities with the wider network.  As the biggest provider of rural transport in the country, almost 10,000 people help to deliver our services every day.  We are proud to be associated with the provision of jobs in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As is any service industry, we are very reliant on our employees, whose dedication and commitment is among the highest In Ireland.  More than 80% of our staff are customer facing, and last year we were very proud to be recognised by the Reputation Institute as having the 42nd best reputation in the country.  We had the second biggest increase in placing among the top 100 companies in Ireland.  This is entirely down to the attitude, commitment and competence of our people, who went to extraordinary lengths again during recent weather events to keep the travelling public connected in most of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, Bus &Eacute;ireann had almost 80,000 passenger trips, including those by school-going children.  This demonstrates the critical role our organisation plays as part of the social and economic fabric of Ireland.  In 2015, we successfully completed the first year of a new five year direct award contract with the NTA, and began a number of projects under that contract which will bring enhanced customer service standards and technology improvements to the business.  We secured funding for 116 new vehicles, which we launched last week.  These will bring higher capacity and comfort to our customers.  Our network improvements and marketing helped to deliver 700,000 extra passenger journeys, and we increased our focus on the customer, setting up a new customer care facility, beginning work on Colbert station in Limerick and reinforcing our commitment to safety above all, through a new school transport campaign aimed at raising seat belt awareness among young children.<\/p><p>All of these initiatives underpin our ambition to be recognised as progressive and deliver on our mission, which is to succeed by providing an excellent service to the public.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway network is a separate commercial service that receives no State funding.  Our fleet livery is familiar, as one sees the big red coaches traversing the country.  The Expressway network comprises 23 interregional routes which operate throughout the country, linking cities and population hubs, and must generate its own funds for necessary investment in fleet, customer service, technology improvements and marketing.<\/p><p> The environment in which we operate these Expressway services has become increasingly competitive, comprising a significant number of other coach companies.  In addition, customers from bigger population centres demand faster journey times with fewer stops, more use of the motorway network and more direct connections to larger population centres.  We have seen new licences granted for routes, and this issue is a matter of utmost concern for our board and management.  The NTA now performs a difficult role with regard to licence issuing and connectivity of the network.  We assist it when necessary, when routes are being designed or realigned, but ultimate responsibility for ensuring connectivity among all of the public transport alternatives now rests with the NTA, and not with Bus &Eacute;ireann, since our legal roles changed in 2009.<\/p><p> As Bus &Eacute;ireann operates more than 300 city and stage carriage routes under public contract with the NTA, we connect thousands of locations and customers on a daily basis, ensuring city and rural stage carriage services are dovetailed with Expressway and other public transport services where it is possible to do so, providing a vast integrated bus and coach network throughout Ireland.<\/p><p> Having addressed the committee last March, we worked closely with the NTA and a solution was provided for the towns affected by our commercial decision to withdraw from Expressway route 5, from Waterford to Dublin through Wicklow, and to curtail our Expressway route 7, originally from Dublin to Cork through Clonmel.  The network solution involved a redesign of our public service routes 132 in Wicklow and 245 between Cork and Mitchelstown, both of which are operated under subsidy as part of our public service contract.  These routes, together with some integrated connections provided by Local Link, which is the rural transport scheme contracted by the NTA and provided under subsidy, perform a role to ensure the people in these communities remain connected.  In this example, the transition from the non-commercial segments of Expressway to public service obligation, PSO, services, has been successful and the subsidisation required is now more prudently aligned with the customer demand in these smaller towns and villages, and not left to our Expressway business to shoulder.<\/p><p> Expressway cannot afford to endlessly provide service on routes which will never deliver a financial contribution and this is a fundamental tenet of being commercial on our interregional and intercity services.  As part of this decision-making ethos in recent years, difficult decisions were necessary and our Expressway services were withdrawn from approximately 20% of secondary locations where customer demand did not exist or did not cover the costs of providing the Expressway service.  That said, through working with the NTA we assure the committee there has been no widespread loss of services to rural locations as a result of the decisions we have made.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland, and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network.<\/p><p> We previously advised the committee that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in survival mode in recent years.  The company worked its way out of the recession and remains committed to work with its stakeholders to deliver the best possible transport system, in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  The pace of economic recovery requires increased public transport levels, and this will require support to foster social and economic inclusion.  With regard to PSO services provided under contract to the NTA, we are pleased there is recognition emerging that the PSO subvention to operate the levels of PSO service requires more funding.  In 2015, we made substantial progress on developing our services in conjunction with the NTA, and we have seen substantial growth in passenger numbers in the markets we provide.  We recently received an additional allocation for 2015, which covered the cost of the services.  We have been advised that the level of funding in 2016 will match our costs and we await final confirmation on the capital side.  We will submit our own application for the 10% of our services being tendered as part of the PSO market opening later this year.<\/p><p> I shared our concerns regarding the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages during our visits to this forum in 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2015.  I also advised that changes to a number of our commercial Expressway intercity routes were required to ensure their survival.  Nothing has changed in this regard, and, in fact, competition on Expressway routes has increased.<\/p><p>With competition increasing, we must continue to ensure the Expressway service is as cost efficient as possible.  The reversal of the 18-month cost-saving agreement with our staff came to an end in 2014 and, taken together with the work stoppage in May of last year, this affected the bottom line and had a very serious impact on our profitability last year.  Expressway broke even in 2014.  Despite savings achieved through various changes, we will be in loss in 2015, which adds financial pressure to our concern.<\/p><p> The board and the management team are committed to examining ways in which to reduce costs to deliver the profitability necessary to secure a viable future for Expressway.  This business requires investment in customer service, fleet, marketing and innovation, and we must create an efficient and cost-effective business model to achieve this.  The matter was discussed at the recent Bus &Eacute;ireann board meeting and the management team has been tasked with bringing a comprehensive strategic plan for Expressway to the board as quickly as possible and to keep the board appraised of progress.  As a company, if we do not make changes and consequently lose the flexibility to respond to the licensing environment which continues to unfold, Expressway will go out of business and jobs will be lost.<\/p><p> I reiterate that Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network given the financial resources available.  Expressway is part of the wider national integrated network but it still operates in a small economy with a high rural constituency.  Our focus as a management team is on preserving and growing Expressway which delivers a significant social dividend to the State through the provision of services not otherwise provided to many regional locations.  We will continue to work in a collaborative and inclusive way with our employees to ensure Expressway is put on a sustainable footing but we must also act to protect the future interests of all stakeholders in this business in a market which has become increasingly competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan for his contribution.

I understand the joint committee wishes to focus on two areas in particular, first, the interurban and Expressway commercial bus services and, second, the co-ordination of rural transport services with the Expressway network.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions, I am joined by Tim Gaston who manages public transport services in the authority.<br\/><br\/>Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I wish to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority.  The remit of the National Transport Authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  These include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.<br\/><br\/>The authority is responsible for securing the provision of public bus services through two specified mechanisms: public service contracts where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis and the licensing of public bus services which are operated on a commercial basis.  In licensing commercial bus services, it is important to note that the relevant legislation requires the authority to seek to achieve, in the public interest, regulated competition in the provision of such services.<br\/><br\/>On the specific areas of focus raised by the committee, bus services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann under its Expressway brand are commercial services and are licensed by the authority in exactly the same manner as all other commercial bus services.  Licences set out the nature of the service and conditions under which licensed public bus passenger services must operate, such as the point of origin and destination as well as timetable and stopping place details<b>.<\/b>The majority of interurban services, including those between the regional cities and Dublin city and Dublin Airport, are provided on a commercial basis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and a number of private operators provide these services which are licensed by the authority.<br\/><br\/>In exercising its functions the authority seeks to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus or transport mode, or both, is required.  This includes the operation of rural transport services, operated as Local Link, which can facilitate connecting to mainline interurban services, irrespective of the provider of those services, and including, but not limited to, Expressway.  The objective of the rural transport programme is to provide a good quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  In 2015, funding of &euro;10.7 million was provided through the authority for the programme.<\/p><p> The rural transport programme came under the aegis of the authority in April 2012.  The programme was initially managed by Pobal on behalf of the authority but since January 2014 is now directly managed by the authority.  A restructuring strategy was launched in July 2013.  Since assuming responsibility, we have focused on restructuring the programme to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness.  The restructuring programme included the establishment of 17 transport co-ordination units which replaced the 35 rural transport groups previously managing the programme.  Local passenger services are managed by the relevant transport co-ordination unit in each area on the authority's behalf.  This restructuring has positioned the programme to better integrate with other public transport services, and provides a solid base to expand or adapt services to meet current and future identified needs.<\/p><p> Now that the organisational restructuring has been completed, we are focused on optimising the services provided within the funding envelope available.  A review of services is currently in progress to ensure that they are meeting user requirements and our objectives.  <\/p><p> Transport co-ordination units work closely with the local authorities on the assessment of local transport needs, including those people who are socially excluded.  With the benefit of this local collaboration, we expect to make considerable progress in 2016 on refining and expanding, where appropriate, the operation of local transport services, in addition to ensuring the optimal level of integration with the other public transport services.<\/p><p> That concludes my introductory presentation.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.

Mr. Nolan indicated that the service made a loss in 2015.  I understand the accounts for 2015 have not been fully prepared but will he indicate the scale of the projected losses and the impact this will have in 2016?  Does Mr. Nolan think that Bus &Eacute;ireann will be able to bring its cost structure in line with its revenues for 2016 or is the company projecting a loss by the Expressway service for the year?  In his presentation, Mr Nolan states that the company operates in an increasingly competitive environment with ever-expanding activity on some of the routes.  I would have hoped that the increase in passenger activity would have helped to address some of the increased competition but clearly that is not the case.  Will he elaborate on the nature of the competitive environment in which the service operates?  Has saturation point been reached on some routes?  Is the competition that is required under legislation reaching a point where it is making it difficult for all concerned to survive on certain routes?  Obviously, there are wider implications in a competitive environment because it could ultimately lead to a deterioration in services.  We know what happens when the point of saturation is reached, namely, it effectively becomes a race to the bottom and the service is diminished.  The customer is the obvious loser in the long term.  My concern, based on what Mr. Nolan said, is that we may be at the start of the road to that ultimate outcome.  I would like Mr. Nolan to address this matter.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.  I have had the opportunity to discuss with the NTA on a number of occasions the very good work it does in attempting to put in place a national plan for the delivery of public transport services, both in terms of the licensing remit and managing the public service obligation element.  What criteria are in place to ensure that the issuance of licences will not result in an over saturation of a particular market to the point where it will not be financially viable for operators to survive?<\/p><p>Often, one can let the market decide and try to pick up the pieces thereafter.  This is a regulated environment, after all.  The witnesses do not need me to tell them about the requirement to try to ensure there is a viable market, as opposed to a predatory approach that would ultimately lead to a race to the bottom.  What kinds of checks and balances are in place?  What type of testing is done?  What advice do the witnesses have for the Legislature?  What should operators like Mr. Nolan do to ensure this eventuality does not arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#L00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>A number of low-cost no-frills operators have entered this heavily competitive market in recent years.

All of those figures are approximate.  It is clear that a commercial operation which is not in a profitable position needs to be addressed quickly.  That is why we have asked the executive to come up with a very comprehensive strategic plan, which we will discuss in a collaborative fashion with our stakeholders, particularly our employees and their representatives, to ensure we have a route to continued profitability and sustainability for the Expressway network into the future.  This is an important element of the matter.  We have invested heavily in new coaches.  We do not use second-hand coaches on our network.  We have invested heavily to ensure our branding is clear and easily distinguished to attract as many consumers to our product as possible.  With regard to competition, I accept that we are in a very competitive environment.  We provide just 18% of the services on the Dublin-Limerick route, for example.  That gives the Deputy an indication of the level of competition we face.  We are facing that competition in a very positive fashion.

I would like to begin by asking about the issue of school runs.  How often are the routes reviewed?  I recently met the family of a five year old boy in respect of whom an application was made in advance of his starting school.  They were told he would be on the bus route and they made the relevant payment, but when they went to the private provider, they were told he would have to be picked up a kilometre up the road.  Obviously, a five year old boy is not going to walk that far.  His mother feels that if she has to put him into the car, she might as well drive him to school.  When we did a bit of investigating, we found that a private coach operator had been hired by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Obviously, this operator must take the route it has been told to take.  The members of the boy's family did their own investigation and provided a new route, which is safe, is a kilometre shorter and goes past their door.  They asked for this to be looked at, but their request was not even addressed.  I wonder how often the routes are reviewed.  If a solution is found, as it was in this instance, can it be looked at or are these matters set in stone?<\/p> <p>  Obviously, as Deputy Dooley has said, the witnesses have a very difficult job.  People are happy with express routes because they want to get to or from work, but such routes often leave out people in smaller towns who want to get connected.  Mr. Nolan gave an example of a case in which a solution was found by looking at other routes and rearranging them.  Is that being done for all the routes that have been changed?  For example, the 115 route between Dublin and Mullingar used to cover the area between Dunboyne and Summerhill in County Meath, but four locations - Moynalvey, Culmullen, Kilcloon and Baytown - are now excluded and the people in those places feel they are being left out.  Do the witnesses review cases like that?  Do they look to see what other services might be provided for the people of such areas?<\/p> <p>  How are the prices for the various routes decided?  I would have regularly travelled from Navan to Dublin when I was younger and when I was in college.  I know that a one-way ticket from Navan to Dublin now costs more than &euro;11, whereas one could travel a lot further down the country for a lot less.<\/p><p>Is it decided on the basis of proximity or the number of people who use the route?  How is it arrived at?<\/p><p> If a new bus stop is being sought on a route, what are the requirements?  We have a number of requests in Navan where a service is required.  How can people apply for that and how is it decided?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#N00700","speaker":"1180","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the Navan route, we do that under contract to the NTA so both of us will come in on that.<\/p> <p>  We review school routes constantly.

The Deputy referred to network reviews.  We have a group within the NTA whose sole purpose is to review the networks continually.  We are taking on board comments being made in respect of the entire range of issues.  As well as detailed discussion with Bus &Eacute;ireann and looking at the bus loadings, we also take account of what other local provision there is in the area.  With the NTA also having responsibility for rural transport, we are working increasingly to dovetail the services.  As such, where a PSO operates or changes are introduced prior to that, we will discuss it with local transport co-ordination unit management to see and ensure that communities continue to be served.  As such, networks are being reviewed on a regular basis and the two teams - our own and Bus &Eacute;ireann's - meet on a very regular basis to see where we can bring about improvements.  Improvements are not really driven by the bottom line either.  They are actually about providing a better service through the day, through the week, through the time of day and in terms of the geography.  Of course, we have to take account of changes in geography and the community.  It is very much an ongoing process.  If there are specific queries members want us to address, they should let us know and we will come back to them on those.<\/p> <p>  Fares for public service obligation services are determined by the authority.  Again, we engage in detailed discussions with operators and model - in advance of a determination - the fare increases to see if they are appropriate and what will be the fare adjustment.  We are in the middle of an exercise involving a number of areas of the country to see if we can move towards a more equitable fares basis nationally.  It is a difficult challenge to meet, of course, and it is something that it will take a number of years to put in place.  If one looks at our fares determination issued last year, one will see that in some areas there were very small increases as we are setting about rebalancing fares.  It is something we look at very closely with the operators.  While we look at the loadings, fares in Ireland are based, by and large, on distance.  Within the eastern region, there is a zoning arrangement with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Since we have rolled out the Leap card in the eastern region, significant discounts have been available to those who choose to use them to travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann and other services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The tax-saver product allows people to get the service at half the price we are talking about.

It was stated that there was a loss in 2015 but the numbers are increasing.  Where will the 116 new vehicles be concentrated?  While they are all wheelchair accessible, how does it leave the fleet in terms of wheelchair accessibility?  I am not sure if we are up to 100% and I would like the witnesses to give us an idea of where we are in relation to that very important issue.<\/p> <p>  The last time the witnesses were in, we talked about routes 5 and 7 and the serious effects on the local communities.  There were direct connections through private transport.  The witnesses are saying now that the agreement that has been reached there has helped.  Can it be explained because I was not following it too well and would just like to get my head around how much of an impact it has had?  We had a lot of complaints from people in the communities along the routes.<\/p> <p>  Tendering for some of the routes was mentioned.  I remember that when we argued about this before, the Government was talking about putting 10% out to tender.  However 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in Waterford was mentioned.  If we are going to tender those and will give up 100%, what are we aiming to do in Waterford?  I would like to know what we are trying to do.  Is it the intention to privatise that whole section or is Bus &Eacute;ireann going to tender for the service also?  I would like that to be explained to me because I find it a bit contradictory.<\/p> <p>  Have there been huge savings in fuel costs?  I would have thought that there would have been massive savings with the way fuel prices have gone which would have helped in terms of targets.  The Minister tells us that the PSO is remaining the same.  When I was reading some of this earlier, I noted that there were to be changes in the PSO for Kerry and Mayo.  Those are planned to be implemented in the near future.  How will that impact on those areas?  Will the changes affect services and will there be cutbacks in some of the routes?  Will the routes be more direct?<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses explain how the community has an input in all of this?  Do people go out to talk to the community?  What way is it done?

Passenger numbers on the PSO side have been very good in the last number of years, but it has been patchy in some areas.  There is more growth in Dublin and Cork than in rural Ireland.  The provincial cities grew by 4% last year and Cork alone is up by 8% or 9% in the last couple of months.  We anticipate similar growth this year.  The vehicles that are coming in will be deployed across the whole network, but there are specific places that require additional capacity.  We are putting additional double-deck vehicles into Cork and taking out single-deck vehicles.  There will be additional capacity around the greater Dublin area given what has happened in terms of congestion.

It is correct that there were a number of public consultation meetings and representations were made to us, to Bus &Eacute;ireann and to others at the time.  We organised a number of discussions and then reviewed the entire network requirements in those immediate areas.  We came in with a package of services that would deliver to the communities that were being impacted on by the withdrawals.  There were three main way by which we delivered.  We modified some of the PSO services in those areas to bring in additional communities.  Through discussions with the transport co-ordination units, we also put additional funding, something of the order of &euro;300,000, into the rural network to support additional services in that area.  We also took out a couple of small services that were not being met by either of those two options.  We went to the market and providers came in and those services are now up and running, all being provided by local businesses.  Through a network of mechanisms and packages of solutions we had, we were able to configure things to provide services to those communities.  The level of commentary back to the National Roads Authority has fallen very significantly.  We would consider that to be a successful delivery.<\/p> <p>  On the question of tendering of routes, a decision was made to tender 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann services to the open market.  The process of tendering really required us to put together packages of services that could be delivered by another provider coming in, so the decision was made to take 10% and split it into two specific packages on the Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  One of those packages is a number of the services in the Waterford area.  When a new provider is coming in, it makes sense that it should have a locality in which to have a base.  We have chosen two for the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus market opening exercise, the Waterford area and the Kildare corridor.  About 7% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be the Kildare corridor services and about 3% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be in Waterford.  Those packages were put out to the market last year and that procurement is still continuing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy asked specifically about PSO funding.  Mr. Martin Nolan has touched on this in his response.  In fact, the Department and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have granted the NTA additional PSO funding for 2016.  We are in the process of again working with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and the transport co-ordination units to see where we can expand and bring in additional services.  The Kerry area was reviewed last year and an additional network of services was provided in Kerry to bring about improvements.  We are looking at present at a number of other geographical areas across the country, which we will bring in as quickly as can be done sensibly within the PSO and the rural transport network, using the transport co-ordination units.  <\/p> <p>  On the question of community input, that comes in a number of ways.  Representations come to the National Roads Authority and we regularly meet community groups, local representatives and so on.  One of the strengths of the rural programme continues to be the extent to which local people are involved in the transport co-ordination units, TCUs.  Each TCU has its own board, comprising people who give of their time voluntarily to contribute to the discussions as to how best those local needs are meet.  We then contribute to the funding of their services and we give guidelines and get involved in network planning where it is appropriate to dovetail with other services.<\/p><p>The vast majority of the decisions that are important to the local community are made by the management of the transport co-ordination units, TCUs, guided by their local board.

Bus &Eacute;ireann buys diesel in advance at &euro;1.20 per litre.  The price of diesel is now down to 99.8 cent a litre in places.  When it falls lower than that, will the company buy enough in bulk in order that it might save a great deal of money down the road?  The price of oil is expected to fall to somewhere between $22 and $24 dollars.  When the opportunity arises, will the company make sure it buys enough diesel in advance?  A group appeared before the committee recently to discuss natural gas and Ireland's move to a low-carbon economy.  They said buses would move to natural gas.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann buying buses with that facility?  It costs &euro;18,000 to install the relevant technology.<\/p> <p>  On school transport, why was the old school rule abolished?  It is causing many problems around the country.  Another problem that crops up here and there, which I am sure every Deputy has encountered, is children attending schools that are further away from them than others.  I am familiar with cases of bullying and other problems which meant the children had to move to other schools and they had to pay for their bus tickets.

If the cost has reduced from &euro;1.50 to &euro;1, the revenue potential is a little bit lower, so it is back to giving the bus an advantage over the car, so that we can all move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Is Bus &Eacute;ireann VAT exempt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We are zero rated which means we cannot reclaim our VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>VAT is included in Bus &Eacute;ireann's fuel cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00900","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>How much fuel in money terms does Bus &Eacute;ireann use in the year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01000","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>We spend about &euro;27 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>So the company cannot claim back the VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>No, but we do get a small fuel rebate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Those with lorries get that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01400","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>That is the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>There is &euro;5 million in VAT that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not allowed to claim back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01600","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The big saving in bus transport is getting 50 people out of a car on to a bus; even if it is a 20 year old bus, it will save more.

Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have smaller buses than the 45 seaters?  There is a service that goes from Cavan through Leitrim down to Sligo on a Saturday morning.  I see it nearly every Saturday morning around 10 a.m. and there would not be any more than 15 or 20 people on this big 45 seater bus.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann looked at similar routes across the country and considered introducing smaller buses?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the NTA and perhaps it might be better if I was to talk to the witnesses privately about Westlink Coaches, who are currently in a tangle over licensing of a route.  To put it simply, they are allowed to carry university students from Leitrim through Roscommon to Galway university, where they drop them near the campus.  However, they are not allowed to pick up the same passengers on a Sunday evening going through Castlerea, Ballygar, Williamstown and Dunmore.  There is another operator on that route.  They have lodged an appeal because it seems their last appeal was turned down on the basis that there were insufficient numbers.  They have now provided further numbers coming from NUIG, GMIT and they are also being told by NTA that there is a Bus &Eacute;ireann service operating on the same route.<\/p><p>That Bus &Eacute;ireann route goes all over the country, going into Ballyhaunis and into Mayo, yet as we know the students want to get home.  I wish to raise this issue and I am just flagging it as I would like to talk privately to somebody about it afterwards.  This operator is providing more than 20 jobs in Drumshanbo, a small town of 800 people.  It would be devastating if he were to lose out.  It does not make sense to me that he is allowed to bring passengers from Drumshanbo through Roscommon and Galway into NUIG and yet not allowed to bring passengers whom he picks up in Castlerea because a licence was given to another operator.  This issue needs to be examined.  I was with the Minister when he was in Leitrim recently.  He promised the people from Westlink he would contact the witnesses about this.  I would like to have this issue addressed sooner rather later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#W01100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The Senator can raise it privately afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#X00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>What about the fleet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#X00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>On a Saturday morning one would have full loads early in the morning but in the course of the day, fewer people would travel on the bus.
