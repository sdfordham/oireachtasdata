Ireland's higher education system has played a major role in the development of Irish society and the economy and will continue to do so as we seek to build an innovative, knowledge-based economy which provides sustainable employment opportunities and good standards of living for our citizens as well as a broad education.  We are aware of the pressure that has been on third level institutions in recent years to accommodate an increasing number of students at a time of scarce resources.  In view of these considerations, the issue of quality of teaching in third level institutions is very important and always has been.  To brief us on this matter, I am pleased to welcome Dr. Jen Harvey, head of learning at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Professor Mary Gallagher, school of languages and literature, UCD, and Dr. Greg Foley, school of biotechnology, Dublin City University.  This meeting has been sought by Senator Mary Louise O'Donnell for a long time.  In fact, since the committee was established, she has been highlighting the issue and asking us to have a meeting on it.  We are glad to finally get round to her request.  To get our discussion under way, I invite Dr. Harvey to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I was given the brief to talk about quality of teaching in higher education and I have interpreted it in that way.  The issue has become one of increasing importance as the landscape of higher education has changed.  We face international competition and there is greater diversity in the student population.  Things have changed substantially in the last ten or 15 years in Ireland.  There is emergent technology of which we can avail.  I want to talk us through a context for consideration of quality of higher education before focusing on key elements related to teaching quality which is about the importance of student learning and engagement and academic development.  I have also included  for the committee's consideration a number of references which draw on some of the extensive discussions around the Green Paper and quality of teaching in the UK.<\/p> <p>  In terms of considering teaching as responding to the national agenda, from the Hunt report there has been a variety of strategies until recently.  There has been the strategy of the national plan for equality of access which looks to higher education institutions to encourage participation and which seeks to give increasing accountability to higher education institutions on meeting specific targets.  Of particular importance is the issue around excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience within third level, which is key.  Certainly, Ireland has always been a leader in this area.  This is also in terms of making us globally competitive and internationally orientated.<\/p><p> Quality teaching is a concept which is difficult to define.  It is very complex.  There are many factors which impact on quality of teaching.  It cannot really be looked at in isolation.  One cannot separate it from discussions on quality cultures and learning support within institutions.  The concept of teaching quality takes different forms depending on whether one is a full-time student or whether one is studying online, etc.  It is also very much stakeholder relative in terms of employers, students, academics.  Other stakeholder groups would have different interpretations as to what quality is.  In looking at quality, one tends to think of the inspirational, passionate teacher.  If we are considering what makes a teacher extraordinary, it is very much about the teaching experience.  He or she knows how to teach, what to teach and how to improve.  It is about bringing students along.  He or she needs to have passion and inspiration, which is what sets him or her above ordinary teachers.  He or she also needs the toolkit.  That is one of the strengths DIT brings to the table in that all of our new academics undertake our postgraduate diploma and we have an extensive CPD support programme for teachers and academics who are at different stages of their career development.<\/p><p> I refer in particular to the importance of student retention and success.  There has been a focus nationally around and about the whole issue of transition to third level and the effort to retain students.  The key element within this has to be about student engagement.  I welcome the consultation document which has been commissioned about how we might do this more effectively.  The reality is that a lot of institutions have not taken the opportunity to do this as well as they might.  That is more than just about getting students to be active learners.  It is also about involving them in decisions as producers of the curriculum and negotiating and learning pathways which are appropriate to them.  That also links into the quality of teaching issue.  I have included some slides around the student engagement at Trinity because I thought it was useful.<\/p><p> As good teachers, we need to determine what students do and direct them to purposeful activities.  We need to put in place effective educational practices to do that.  That is about resourcing, supporting and providing timely strategies and policies to ensure quality.  We have recently undertaken to develop a student engagement strategy.  I have included some examples in the slides which I circulated previously.  I will pull out some which are particularly important.  There is this idea of a sense of belonging and teachers ensuring that students coming into third level feel as if they should be there, building confidence and engaging them as part of a community.  That is community with their peers within the institution and in terms of their professional direction into the future, which is key to retention.  There is the idea of learning as a shared responsibility.  Alongside that is providing a supportive learning environment where they get support from their peers and also provide feedback.  It is the institution's responsibility to act on that feedback and to build alongside of this research capability.<\/p><p> We are putting in place the best practice.  Within DIT, we have been looking to provide enriching educational experiences which aim to build our learners as lifelong, autonomous learners but also to provide them with skills so that whether they decide to move internationally or become actively engaged within their local communities, they have the confidence to do so and the appropriate skills and abilities to articulate it.  Within the learning teaching and technology centre, LTTC, at DIT, we have provided a great deal of support for academics so that they might encourage the development of this high-quality learning experience.  Part of that is through the postgraduate diploma, but it is also through continuous professional development with small, timely CPD events on diverse topics, including higher educational policy.  Recently, we had a CPD event for academic leaders in learning, teaching and assessment to give managers with responsibility for resource allocation the appropriate skills to better support this.  Key within that is the focus on assessment and feedback.<\/p><p>One thing I would like to see developed and encouraged is a change to some of the assessment and feedback practices.  We have elicited a number of initiatives and research founded through teaching fellowships, etc. to recognise good practice and to feed this back into models which are scalable.<\/p><p> Alongside that, it is about eliciting curriculum change and working with programme leaders and programme teams in order that there is a discussion about the holistic experience of students, from the pre-entry first alert on the website, where they think they will do a particular course provided there is the support, before they come in, during the first year, through their programme and into the future.  In looking to the merger as the Technological University for Dublin, TU4D, into the future, it is giving us an opportunity to work and to hear the students voice.  When looking at our model for learning for our students, we can put in place a quality curriculum that would support this.  That is very much about preparing our students and empowering them.  It is about giving the opportunity to discover and to develop through flexible learning and also tailored support.  Support is key and it needs to be timely, giving them the opportunity to practise in a safe environment with their peers and with colleagues and to be able to apply the theory in a timely manner.<\/p><p> I hope we manage to consolidate the theory and the experience into a package that provides the students with the skills to develop the graduate attributes and to leave as reflective practitioners into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jen Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Professor Mary Gallagher whom I invite to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#H00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for having organised this discussion.  I am really happy to appear before the committee to speak about what I love, which is my work in higher education.  It will not be just about my work, obviously.  I need to state that I am not representing the views of UCD or speaking for UCD in any way.  As the committee is aware, higher education is a very diverse sector and almost anything I say will be true of some of it but it will not be true of all of it.  I just want to make that disclaimer.  I know I am protected by a certain amount of privilege but I would probably need to be on some kind of witness protection programme to say some things that are probably true of the whole lot.  Everybody is doing their best and there are still huge problems.  I hope what I am going to say makes sense.  I have tried to compress it into the seven minutes but I think that is sometimes at the cost of coherence.<br\/><br\/>The first subtitle I have is the idea of a national debate.  I really think we need a national debate on higher education.  It should focus on what Ireland wants from higher education.  We have to make a distinction between higher education and further education.  If one says &quot;higher&quot;, one means superior, a higher order.  It is a different thing.  It is to educate at a higher level.  What do we mean by &quot;higher&quot;?  I think we might mean critical and creative thinking or, at least, a critical and creative engagement with detail and with depth in a given area.  Of course, one needs a certain amount of knowledge and information to be able to engage in that way, but I think that is what we should be looking for from higher education in this country.<br\/><br\/>I took about two years out of my day job to write a book about what I think Ireland should be looking for from higher education.  It took me about two years to write it and it was published in 2012.  I called it <i>Academic Armageddon: An Irish Requiem for High Education<\/i>.  I did not realise I needed to be in a witness protection programme before I would do something like that.  It was to call attention to one major point - how making a business out of education, any education, including higher education, is really at the heart of our problem in this country, not just ours but in other countries too.<\/p><p>I think this is an organic problem which is starting to affect second level too.  One sees it in all the language schools that we are forced to close in Ireland but one also sees the problems and tensions that exist between the private secondary schools and the public secondary schools, the fee-paying and the non-fee-paying schools, the grind schools and the institutes.  Of course, education is an organic system.  That is why I am appearing before the committee.  The reason I called the book <i>Academic Armageddon<\/i>was because what is happening in the western world, especially in the English-speaking or global world system, is that academic standards and academic integrity are being destroyed.  What I mean by that is that in some cases a kind of a funny version of what is academic is being made into the be-all and end-all of everybody's life.  It seems it has to be everybody's life.  We have only one precious finite life, as Senator O'Donnell said.  We all have finite lives.  All our youth are being told academic success is the be-all and end-all.  I really think that is what is destroying academic standards.  It is curious.  They are victims of their own sort of success.  When that book came out, it came out to silence; no public refutation but no public response.  I think that if even 10% of the analysis of that book was well-founded, it would have merited a national debate.  I really do think that.<br\/><br\/>What do I think we should do in Ireland?  We should stop allowing higher education institutions to be run as competitive businesses.  Of course, they are not all run as competitive businesses but some are and there is a trend.  We should stop pretending that it is possible to take the studying out of studenting, that one can be a student without studying.  That is not possible.  We should stop pretending that students are clients.  We should stop letting them think that is what their contract is with the higher education institution and also stop pretending that 85% of Ireland's youth are academically inclined and should be going to university because these are all, in my view, damaging lives.  I was going to point to Germany but we all know about how it avoids this damage and how, as a result, apprenticeships rather than degrees are so highly valued and why France is trying to imitate Germany.  France points to Germany.  In Germany why are such able people going into apprenticeships and France is trying to go that way?  Either Irish school leavers are up to 50% more academically inclined and talented than their European peers or else they are being misdirected into further academic endeavour when they would be probably better suited to following a less pseudo-academic training, whatever that might be.  I definitely think that England, the US and Australia, not Scotland, are the wrong models for us to look towards as a university because that is where the most intractable problems are coming from, the atrocious idea of exorbitant tuition fees, whoever pays them, included.<br\/><br\/>If, as I believe, the Anglo, aka global, brand is toxic, it is linked to the spread of a zombie culture in higher education wherever it is applied.  We should be looking to more free, responsible, sane, healthy, independent northern European models instead.  I do not know why we have chosen to copy the worst of the Anglo global world.  All Anglo businesses, Anglo universities, are in common market competition with each other and they all see branding as the answer.  We have it on the radio before the six o'clock news where they are fighting for customers.<br\/><br\/>Distinguishing the university from its so-called competitors is of the essence.<\/p><p>They are synonymous always with extortionary prices.  That is what distinguishes those awful little shoes one can get in Dunnes Stores for a fiver.  My children wear the Converse brand.  They are just a brand but they ruin one's feet the same way as the little flat runners from Dunnes Stores.  Be aware of branding.  <\/p><p> If one is a business, one does not necessarily have time to focus on the education part but in so far as the corporate university focuses on education, it is bent on increasing student throughput and retention.  What that means in practice is not awarding fail grades.  There is also a focus on staff performance but I cannot go there because I do not have time.  This is becoming a terrible problem.  The real causes of poor retention figures are not just the plunging staff-student ratios - in other words, a funding issue - or an exodus of experienced staff into early retirement, etc., and recessionary cuts, but also the shameful codding of school leavers into university.  What we see happening at the educational chalk face is an almost irresistible dumbing down of academic subjects.  One might say, \"So what?\"  In my subject there is an awful lot of \"what\" about that.  I teach French and either a student can read French and understand what he or she is reading or her or she cannot.  Either he or she can write French that someone else is going to understand or he or she cannot.  Either he or she can speak and understand what somebody else is saying or he or she cannot.  When one is awarding a D minus grade, one is saying a person can do none of those things but one is getting the student over the hump and one is not getting grief from the system that is bearing down on one to push the student through.  Failure is just not acceptable.  It is very difficult to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Perhaps Professor Gallagher could conclude shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#K00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The discussion will bring much of this out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#K00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will move to the shutting down of hard subjects.

I teach in DCU.  I will come back to that word in a minute or two.  I do research and I am also the associate dean so I have a triple mandate.  That is a key point.  It is not that I am particularly interesting because that is typical of academics within the sector in that they do a lot of things.  This takes me to my main point which is that the word \"teaching\" in a university context is problematic.  We are not teachers in the sense of second level teachers.  Third level if fundamentally different from second level or at least it should be unless we want to radically change our vision of third level.  I agree very much with Professor Mary Gallagher that we do not have a proper vision as to what third level should be.<\/p><p>I said that also in my submission's conclusion.  All sorts of stakeholders have differing views.  Employers see it as training while many people, in particular students and their parents, see it as an extended form of second level.  The Government, in particular the current Government in recent years, has seen it as an engine of economic growth as if that can be separated from its educational brief.<\/p><p> The multifaceted nature of third level education is absolutely key.  Although this might get me into a little bit of trouble, I must say that initiatives such as the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning in higher education are fundamentally flawed in that they do not take account of the triple mandate, at least, that an ordinary academic has.  Most academics will do some research, some teaching and some administration and they will parcel out those roles slightly differently.  Unless we take into account that the culture in third level education is fundamentally different from second level, we will go down blind alleys and eventually we will just try to reproduce what is done in second level at third level.  That would be a real shame.  That is my basic premise.<\/p><p> I do not know what it is that we do.  We do not just lecture.  I do laboratory modules, tutorials and a lot of active learning in the classroom so I am not just a lecturer, but I do not think of myself as a teacher.  If one looks at the key difference between third level and second level education, it is the role played by independent learning.  A typical module in the STEM disciplines will have four hours of independent learning for every hour of contact.  That is radically different from second level so when one hears various stakeholders, politicians included, making statements about the lack of contact time, they are misunderstanding third level education.  An educator in the third level sector guides somebody, charts a course through a subject for him or her and perhaps explains things and is there to support the student.  He or she inspires and motivates students but he or she is not a teacher.  We really have to get that into our heads.<\/p><p> I agree with Professor Mary Gallagher that there is a teaching and learning industry out there.  I heard somebody refer to it as the \"T and L-aliban\", a sort of take on the Taliban.  There is a culture of fear that if one does not adopt what are student-centred methods, one will get very poor reviews from students.  <\/p><p> SIPTU did a recent survey in DCU where some staff actually felt bullied by students because the demands were so great.  I frequently answer e-mails at night from students.  In my kitchen this morning, while eating my Shreddies, I was answering e-mails from students on my telephone because they have an examination tomorrow.  It has become very student-centred.  The table in page two of my submission shows the enormous administrative load that lecturers are under between student surveys of teaching and student reps.  Next week, I will be inundated with students coming to my office to look at exam scripts to get feedback and for me to justify my marks.  We have annual programme reviews, periodic programme reviews, quality reviews, professional reviews and we have tracking systems for students.  Anyone who says that teaching and learning is not taken seriously at third level is seriously wrong.  In fact, I think that so far we have created a dependency culture and that is not good.<\/p><p> I will depart from what I was going to say and refer to the drop out rates because it came up last week.  It relates to some of the things Professor Mary Gallagher said.  The HEA produces reports on drop out, although I should not say \"drop out\".  They are non-progression rates because the students come back into the system.  The only single metric one can use to predict drop out is what is called prior academic achievement.  The courses that have high drop out are low point courses.  We are taking people into demanding courses who are just not academically up to it.  They have got such low points that they are probably getting their seventh, eighth or ninth choice, so they have picked the wrong course because they are academically on the weaker end of the spectrum. <\/p><p> One of the issues that has come up through the forum is whether university lecturers should have a formal qualification in teaching.  My own opinion is \"No\".  It would nice to know a little more cognitive science, for example, but it is something that is a \"nice to do\" rather than a \"need to do\".<\/p><p>It does not take into account the fact that if the culture of a university values research, having an educational qualification or continuing professional development will degenerate into box ticking.  Somebody will do a postgraduate diploma and use whatever means they can to get promoted.  Usually, the quickest way to do this is to excel at research.<\/p><p> The fundamental barrier to improving teaching is the fact it is very difficult to measure the quality of teaching.  Good teaching is defined as that activity which improves student learning.  However, there are many ways to do this.  The two best lecturers I ever had in my career were Frank MacLoughlin at UCD, who has retired, and someone at Cornell University.  One used an overhead projector and the other used a blackboard and chalk.  They were inspirational and fantastic teachers.  My fear is that the teaching and learning industry will generate into ideology, as it has with Ofsted in the UK, and that if one is not teaching in a certain student-centred way, it will be perceived as not being dedicated to teaching.  I have a real fear of this.  I know many very good lecturers who do not do anything particularly innovative and are not visible as excellent teachers.  They may be excellent researchers but they teach very well in the background and are not making a song and dance about it.<\/p><p> Cuts to higher education funding have been ongoing.  I am an engineer.  I tend to be a bit of a nerd with data and I go back and look at things.  The cuts in higher education preceded the global financial crisis.  They date back to 2006 at least.  There has been a mindset among policymakers that, for whatever reason, higher education, university education and third level education should not be funded to the same extent as primary and second level education.  This is a mindset issue.  It is particularly visible in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, disciplines.  I find it quite difficult to understand how this disconnect occurs.  Last October or November, the Government launched its capital investment plan, Building on Recovery, to run to 2020.  In this it pledged to spend &euro;27 billion, including an increase in funding for research, innovation and job creation from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;5 billion by 2020.  Included in this is an expectation to increase PhD numbers by 30% and postdoctoral researcher numbers by 30%.  At the same time, it committed &euro;110 million to higher education.  These figures make no sense because the pipeline for research and innovation and for those PhD students is their undergraduate education, particularly their experience in undergraduate laboratories.<\/p><p> There is a crisis in terms of the of funding laboratories in every institution.  This will probably get me into trouble because I am saying something that does not reflect well on us.  However, I say it because it is typical of the sector.  I brought a panel of biopharma people around our laboratories as part of a quality review.  They were very complimentary and stated that we do great work.  When I brought them to one particular laboratory, there was an audible gasp when they saw how out of date the equipment was.  Much can be done with very little in education and we can still teach the basics but laboratories throughout the country use equipment connected to computers which look like they were built by Alan Sugar in the 1980s.  There is a real crisis.  I find extraordinary the disconnect between the rhetoric of the knowledge economy and willingness to fund the grassroots.  I do not quite understand why it is the case.  It is like in sport where people suddenly decide to put millions into elite athletes, as was done in England for cycling.  Doing so wins gold medals but meanwhile the grassroots die.  This is a real danger here.  The CAO preferences for science and applied science have been dropping since 2013.<\/p><p>I have a feeling we have been operating in a science bubble and that, as the economy picks up, we will see a lack of interest in science.  People think this will go on for ever and we will have all of these PhD graduates.  However, what if we do not provide an undergraduate experience of having well-equipped laboratories?  I am not stating that everything has to be off the shelf or the latest model but it must be better than 1990s equipment.  Unless we commit to this, no number of foreign students - or any other methods universities are trying at present - will solve the capital investment problem.  We are addressing it in DCU.  I will not say how we are getting the money but people probably know.  We are actually doing it because it has come to a stage where we must.  We can longer teach laboratory courses, which are a big part of STEM education, unless there is serious investment.  The greatest crisis affecting the higher education system is that we are not putting in capital investment.  It must be a rolling plan.  There must be a commitment every year in every budget that X million will be spent on higher education.<\/p><p> I truly believe third level education is about a partnership between the lecturer or educator and the students.  I love my job.  I love working with students.  It keeps me young.  I gave a tutorial yesterday and it was just good fun.  There are times when it is really good fun and I really like students.  There is a problem in that the nature of modern culture is such that students find it very difficult to put in the graft required.  I feel quite aggrieved if I am criticised or assessed on the basis of a vision of third level education which presumes I should behave like a secondary school teacher.  Students must play their part.  If we look at the Irish survey of student engagement, the results of which are on page 6 of my submission, approximately 45% of students do fewer than five hours of independent study per week.  This is bad in the STEM subjects but it is even worse in the humanities where students need to do a lot of reading.  One could not read a single book in a week with that level of study.  We have a cultural problem as well as a funding problem and various other issues.<\/p><p> To go back to what Professor Gallagher stated, we need a conversation on what third level is supposed to be.  In saying this, I fear we would end up with a talking shop whereby everybody would just give their tuppence worth and matters would go nowhere.  Everybody is probably aware of the Growing Up in Ireland survey, which is fantastic and which has informed child development.  We need something like this for education.  We could do it very quickly because those involved in the Growing Up in Ireland survey have done it.  From 2017, we could track 10,000 students.  It can be done.  We have a very good track record in Ireland for doing this.  They could be followed over the next ten or 20 years.  Let us begin to use evidence to inform our education policy because it is dominated by anecdote, hearsay and the experiences of people who went to college 30 years ago.  We spend so much that we need this database.  This is my big suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Greg Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will break with the normal format because Senator O'Donnell sought this debate and I invite her to speak now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#N00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I recall a director of education in the university informing me \"This is a research institution\" and then walking off.  I did not know where I was on the campus at the time.

This is evident at second level where if somebody fails higher level mathematics, this is equivalent to obtaining a pass at lower level.<\/p><p>In all my time at university we did not fail students.  We tried every way possible to pass them.  We did not want to fail them, and if they failed, we did not like it and we pulled them up from a mark of 32 to 36 to 38 to try to pass them.  Only if they did nothing were they in the realms of failure.  That is a massive change.  Therefore, when we talk about quality of teaching we are also talking about quality of learning.

There is huge input from students nowadays.  However, regarding the idea of tracking them through their careers, people get wiser as they get older and they look back on their education with slightly different eyes and maybe appreciate it more.  We certainly find that when most of our graduates come back to us they are very complimentary.  Sometimes, in the thick of things - when a student has not done well in an exam, for example - it is not necessarily the best time to ask him or her.  There is a lot of literature on this.  If one considers how valuable student surveys of teaching are, for example, they are very often popularity contests and are not really objective assessments of quality of learning.  In fact, a very recent study produced in Italy showed that ratings in student surveys were inversely proportional to the amount the students learned.  What I have found over the years is that students love a teacher who makes life easy for them.  If a teacher is very organised, provides students with absolutely everything they need and minimises the need to go to the library and do extra work, they will think the teacher is great.

I believe that all teachers at third level should have a teaching qualification of some kind, although it is important what that qualification is.  It is not a tick-box exercise that involves sitting down and learning about cognitive science or some other subject.  In our institution, we made the policy decision to invest in our staff and it is very resource-intensive to provide the support for postgraduate diplomas for all new staff, unless they are completing a PhD.  I must admit that there were various reservations initially as to whether this was a good policy, and how motivated people would be within that.  On day one, we had a couple of people sitting there, arms folded, with an attitude of \"I have to be here.\"  However, these academics recognised that one of the most important aspects of the programme is not just the tool set or the menu of options that is being provided to them through this experience, but the safe space, the time in which they can amend their practices and look at what they are doing as teachers.  They can come and talk about issues they are facing in a structured way.  They can look at others by going to visit them in a very supportive way, in the style of tutor observation.  For example, a scientist can go and see what somebody else is doing in photography by arrangement, and is in turn asked for feedback on how the students are doing this or that.  One learns an enormous amount by looking and seeing what other people are doing.  Most people will only teach the way they were taught or based on whatever their experience was.  By providing the academics with a range of different opportunities, although they might like some better than others, we are giving them the option of making selections afterwards.<\/p> <p>  It is very much a practice-based programme.  I am not saying it is absolutely the best, as I may be a bit biased.  It is portfolio-based in terms of its assessment: there is a range of evidence that those taking part present as part of a portfolio submission, and we support them through this.  It deals with a lot of the challenges with regard to the transition to third level and reflecting on assessment and feedback.  On the point mentioned by Dr. Foley, one of the major challenges in starting out as an academic is that one is pulled in all directions.  The new academic is supposed to be researching, doing administration and trying to get his or her head around it all, and usually, as the new person, has the worst teaching possible.  There are maybe 19 contact hours with students, which the academic must design and develop.  A programme that provides support over the academic's first or second year is invaluable because it gives him or her the time, the opportunity and the safe space to say \"I am having a problem with this,\" \"I am not sure how to do that,\" or \"Has anybody else faced this challenge?\".  To compare it to a traditional second level education certificate is perhaps not the best way of doing it, because we are not all the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jen Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I was suggesting a third level certificate; I was not suggesting a second level certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#P00800","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>When people look at a postgraduate diploma they tend to think of it in the same way as a second level certificate, although I am not saying Senator O'Donnell would do so.

One was John Killeen and another was Michael Jordan who was an amazing man and Neil Jordan's father.  Both men were great communicators who inspired their students and gave everyone the added value to move on.  Unfortunately, not everybody has such attributes.  One can improve oneself through communication and education courses.  One can learn to stand before a large number of people and improve on one's delivery.  However, education costs an awful lot of money nowadays and parents invest so much in their children.  Research is hugely important and one of my daughters is in research at Maynooth University.  If one pays a lot of money, and even if one is not paying but the State is, one is entitled to a proper standard of education.

This links in with the debate we have been having about the quality of teaching.  We have moved on from the imparting of information.  I think the role of educators in higher education is now much more than that.  Our role is to equip our students to be lifelong learners when the information they are getting now is well and truly redundant.  At a time when students can avail of extracurricular activities and many opportunities to engage with external communities, etc., the provision of an enriched educational experience must involve more than sitting or standing in a classroom.<\/p><p>As an institution, we have been involved in considering what teaching quality is in terms of granting awards to academic staff.  I have been involved in various processes through the years and there is a challenge in defining quality of teaching.  We have gone through models whereby students make nominations or academics submit portfolios.  I have never been particularly comfortable with any of these measures.  Last year we introduced a new model whereby students made 1,100 nominations for academic staff members.  It was one of the most positive things I have ever seen because we heard about the inspirational teacher who really captured the essence of a problem and inspired students.  For example, there was somebody who, in a moment of despair, did not know where to turn, and an academic had spent lots of time working with the student.  Another academic had really built up a student's confidence.  There were many such amazing examples.  Linking into what Dr. Foley said, now an academic needs to be so many things to so many people and therefore needs to be able to support and inspire in everything he or she does.<\/p><p> I return to the argument that we need to be able to provide people with the toolkit with which they can do this.  We now have to cater for students who use new technologies.  The skills of being able to mediate and moderate online are very different to those of being able to inspire and engage students in a classroom or those of providing supports and one-to-one tutorials.  That is an amazing skill set.  Sorry, I am babbling but it is definitely something to support because most of the academics with whom I work and the ones who select to engage after the diploma want to try all these different things.  Once they have the core skills, they want to review their assessment and feedback strategies, they want to know whether there is a continuing professional development course through which they can do this, they want to move online and they will ask whether there is an online course through which they can learn from a student's perspective.  We should not generalise too much about everything.  If we can provide academics with all these resources, that is key.  It is not just always about general resourcing, it also involves where that resourcing goes and, linking into what Professor Gallagher said, getting parity of esteem between teaching and research - and nothing else.  We must recognise the importance of that and the skill set that we give to our students or encourage them to develop while they are with us.  It is much more than lots of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#S01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jen Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for letting me speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#T00200","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Harvey, Professor Gallagher and Dr. Foley for attending.  It has been an extremely interesting and timely debate and I thank Senator O'Donnell for requesting it.  I hope the committee will forgive me if I wander a little as I try to make the points that I want to make.<\/p> <p>  Every year when I see graduation photographs in the newspaper, I wonder how many plasterers, motor mechanics and electricians have been lost to academia.  Our value system in this country seems to have gone wrong somewhere.  We pride ourselves on having the best education system in the world but we are driving square pegs into round holes at an unmerciful rate and that really bothers me.  Regarding teaching and learning - we are talking here about third-level teaching and learning in particular - Dr. Foley's point was, for me, instructive.  He sees himself as a mentor, not a teacher.  I believe that to be his proper position.  The expectations in transitioning from second level to third level education are wrong.  We have grown in expectation that we will be taken by the hand through the entire education system by a kindly teacher who will always put us on the right track.  We have gone out of our way to build systems to support that type of thinking.  Dr. Harvey mentioned Blackboard, Moodle and other such things.  In 1996, I went to Holland for the first time to look at electronic learning systems and I introduced them into further education in the same year.<\/p><p>There was an expectation with the Moodle platform that an educator could put everything on it, sit back and interact every now and then.  There was a very interesting conversation - I think it was in DIT - where a lecturer from one of the institutes of technology pointed out that he had gone to all the trouble of putting videos and exercises online, but when he carried out a piece of research he found that he had the same number of failures as before.  He called in those who had failed and asked them what went wrong.  One of them said he hadn't got up on Monday morning because \"I don't get up for lectures on Monday, and it would all be online anyway.\"  The lecturer asked why he had not availed of the online resource in that case, but the student told him he had never got around to it.  Going back to the point Dr. Foley made, there is an expectation that students will be managed through the system.<\/p><p> There are a few key areas for me which I am interested in today.  Where is the HEA?  Why does it not have a representative here?  I would love to hear its view on teaching and learning in third level education.  I would like to see something in the area of mentor training rather than teaching.  I do not believe that teaching, if we look upon it as second level teaching, fits the model for third level.  I am deeply concerned by the casualisation of teaching and lecturing in third level institutions.  It is happening right across our education system and I believe it is to the detriment of the system.  The loyalty that would have existed to the institution is no longer there.  If anything, we see ourselves as being in conflict with the institution rather than being a loyal member of it.  There is also the issue of the disappearance, or the dumbing down, of the hard subjects.  As I throw these points out, I welcome Dr. Foley's comments on them.<\/p><p> I have spoken on a number of occasions about the need for language education.  We visited Helsinki recently with Senator Healy Eames.  A 12 year old child walking through a school stopped and asked me how Ireland was coping with the crisis.  When I asked him which crisis, he said, \"The economic crisis.\"  He spoke in perfect English.  We had a brief conversation about it and I told him his English was excellent.  I asked him if he also spoke Swedish and Finnish.  \"Oh, I do,\" he said, \"and German and Russian, but my German is a little poor.\"  I remember having a debate in which I wanted to bring one language into further education, and they said, \"No, we do not do languages here.\"  And here we are, sitting in the European Union, with no languages.<\/p><p> I can see the Chairman looking at me so I will get through this as quickly as I can.  We now have private providers delivering teaching and learning programmes for further education and secondary education.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we are churning out thousands of teachers for whom we have no jobs.  The third level system was already in place, and I would be interested in Dr. Foley's comments on that.<\/p><p> Dr. Foley's table is instructive on the amount of diverse activities that one must carry out as an educator today.  We seem to be driven by outputs.  Everything is about outputs today.  It is about the number of students who started, what modules they took, and the number who passed.  As Dr. Foley said, not only does one have to correct the scripts; one also has a plethora of students outside the door waiting for an explanation as to why they did badly, or well, as the case may be.  Then the returns must be sent to some department head, who in turn will collate those and send them up the line.  Ultimately, they will finish up with some politician saying that 24% of students did a, b, and c.  It is a nonsense, to my mind.  I believe - I would be interested in Dr. Foley's comments on this - that if we were to talk about teaching and learning, we could leave that nonsense aside.  We have actually started to concentrate on feeding the machine, and the machine is the university system that needs money.  We have taken the money from the universities but we still expect the same outputs.  Maybe we should shrink the student population and start moving into research.  Maybe there should be a greater emphasis on research.  I will finish on that, and I apologise if I have dragged the discussion all over the third level education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#T00300","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I want to make a couple of comments before bringing in Senator Healy Eames.

Teachers at second level are looking at moving away from the traditional imparting of knowledge.  I hope this whole idea will help third level education.  It is not just at higher education that this is needed.  It is needed at all levels.  It is clear that there will be junior certificate reform, regardless of the shape that reform takes.  The NCCA engaged in consultation on how to introduce reforms as part of the attempt to have a curriculum based around the idea of critical thinking.

I am sorry that I missed the witnesses' expos&eacute;s on this issue.  I have a huge interest in the quality of teaching in higher level education.  If the witnesses have already answered my questions, I will be happy to read those answers in the Official Report.<\/p> <p>  I am very conscious of the relationship that needs to exist between students and lecturers.  There are high numbers of students in lecture halls.  I heard Professor Gallagher say that no relating goes on in lecturing.  I would not completely agree with that.  Some people are amazing raconteurs and storytellers with an ability to communicate.  They are inspirational in their own right.  I am talking about undergraduates, in particular.  I have a son in first year.  I know all his peers.  I know the attrition rates are very high and it is a deep concern.  I also know about the mental health issues among our young people.  In particular, I know about the number of accidental deaths and suicides in that age group.  I spent a good number of days over Christmas looking for a body in Oranmore.<\/p><p>We found him after 20 days.  In the previous eight months, there was another case.  Where I live in Oranmore, eight bodies are found every year.  That is terrible.<\/p><p> In the exchange between Senator Craughwell and Dr. Foley, I heard the word \"mentor\".  Would a lecturer meet each of his or her students once in a semester or in a year?  Have they proposals on building a relationship?  One never knows who reaches a young person, be it for teaching and learning, or to see how they are managing away from home.  What scaffolds are in place to build more interaction with students outside the engagement with the student who has failed?  Have the colleges put proactive measures in place to build a relationship with students?  I presume the witnesses are not merely talking about their own practices but what happens in higher education generally.<\/p><p> Would a lecturer have a goal to meet student once in a semester?  I know it is not all about face time because many young people like online time. Will the witnesses address the question from both face to face time, which I think is very important, and online time?  <\/p><p> We need to save students from dropping out.  I believe intervention at the correct time will save them but it is a matter of reaching them.  I have a significant issue with the fact that colleges will not give information to parents once the student is over 18 years.  Who is paying the fees?  Parents pay the fees.  Young people are only feeling their own wings, they are wild.  I understand the importance of respecting that they are 18 years or older, but not all students have that level of maturity.  The level of attrition of students during their first year of college is 29% in the ITs and the average in universities is 11%, a figure which is probably outdated now.  That is too high a loss to the system.  Not only have parents lost a significant amount of money, the State too is at a considerable loss but above all it a major personal loss to the student.  From personal experience across the board and my time in the field of education I can speak about their disappointment.  <\/p><p> What impact has the contribution of Professor Sarah Moore to the awards made on teaching and learning in third level?  She is somebody who could contribute to our proceedings today.

I do not think the argument should be third level or apprenticeships because apprenticeships are dependent on the economy at the time.  One cannot suddenly decide to train 1,000 plasterers if there are no jobs.  I think the major problem in the third level sector is that it is becoming too homogenous.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the first preferences for levels 6 and 7.  Back in 2006 there were 40,000 first preferences for levels 6 and 7 courses and 50,000 for level 8.<\/p><p>The number of students who list a course at levels 6 and 7 as their first preference has dropped to 35,000, where the first preference choice for level 8 course has risen to 65,000.  What is happening is that students want a level 8 course or nothing.  It is no surprise that the dropout rates are highest at levels 6 and 7, even if those students have the same points as those at level 8.  We are now at the point where level 6 and 7 qualifications are viewed as inferior as students want level 8 qualifications or nothing.  I think the homogenisation of the third level sector will be aggravated when we have technological universities.  We will have a third level education system that has 13 or 14 universities and nothing else.  There will be no diversity in the system.  I think all universities should have the power and should be willing to give students an exit route at level 7.  There are many students in the system who are dragging through fourth year.  We are seeing a new phenomenon of students failing in fourth year when they should go at level 7.  Now level 7 is viewed as a substandard qualification.  In ten years time everybody will try to get a place for a level 8 course in universities and no other type of college.  Within that we could have a great deal of diversity that would suit people who might want to go to level 6 or level 7.  Many of the level 8 graduates are doing level 6 and 7 jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Greg Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453294800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>As Senator Craughwell will be leaving shortly, I invite Professor Gallagher to respond to the points he made<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016012000002#X00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453294800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Senator Craughwell made a number of relevant points.

To return to Senator Craughwell's original point, we must get past the idea that third level education is about sitting in lecture halls.  Studying a STEM subject exposes the student to a huge diversity of learning.  He or she spends a lot of time in laboratories and undertakes research projects and group projects.  I tend to teach small classes so I characterise much of my teaching as teaching by walking around.  I do a lot of hands-on problem solving in the laboratories while I teach laboratory modules.  I am glad the Senator raised the issue of big classes, because recently there has been a big push led by Professor Philip Nolan and the task group on reform of university selection and entry, TGRUSE, which is considering the whole area of transition.  One of the current fads is the idea that all students should go into a general entry course and then make their decisions on the subjects in which they will specialise.  That means that people are stuck into these large, impersonal classes while they are making that difficult transition from second level education.

UCD has the largest intake of engineering students in the country for its engineering course, which has a requirement of 510 points.  The most significant determiner of the amount of points required for admission to a course is the prestige of the institution, in my view.  It is nothing to do with the course.  Many of the degree programmes with very small intakes have very low points requirements, and the reason there is a low intake is that nobody wants to do the courses.  Therefore, we should get rid of them because they are wasteful.  The idea that there is an inverse relationship between intake and points is not true.  Trinity College could admit a thousand students into, say, Business, Economic and Social Studies, and the points requirement would still be high.

If we consider retention rates, that is another argument for having broad-based first year programmes.  One finding of a search undertaken by National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning shows that the turnaround time for a decision on the places offered to students is very short.  One of the issues it found was poor choices in students' selection of programmes.  One day you get your leaving certificate results, and only a few weeks later you are in a course that you do not know much about.  If it is not the course for you, you are quite likely to drop out.  There is an argument, therefore, for broad-based courses.  Having said that, however, if a course is too broad-based, maths and the various other subjects tend to be brought in, and if they are taught in a way that is particularly dissociated from engineering or science, students will disengage and be more likely to drop out.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Healy Eames's question about how often academics meet first year students, it does vary, but there is a crucial point by which, if a new student has not met with somebody internally, the chances are they will not feel a sense of belonging, or will not feel part of the community.  In the larger classes, a lot of initiatives recently have been encouraging a peer mentoring system, under which continuing students or graduates come in to associate with smaller groups of students in a structured way; they get credits of some kind for this.  That programme is helping to increase the sense of belonging.  Part of the first year experience and the transition from second to third level is very traumatic, and the national forum has done a lot of work on that transition because its theme last year was advancement.  There is a lot of commissioned work that is really valuable.  It is important to see what does not work, what interventions are most important and when they are needed.  When the commitment is made to take students in, they need to be supported through that journey.  It is not enough to take them in on whatever points they get; they need to be supported.  If there are students at risk, they need to be provided with associated support and at least consulted.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with regard to students' ability to change course.  A person who wishes to change must withdraw and reapply.

One size does not fit all.  DIT certainly has a diversity of learners, and to assess them only in one or two methods - I am not saying that happens at DIT - does not capture the strength of the different kinds of learning and the different academic qualities that students are bringing.  There is such a diversity of programmes within the institute.  We need to be reflecting and doing something different.  It is fundamental within the first year.  Students need to know very early on how they are doing relative to others, whether they are progressing, whether they have the right skills and so on.  That needs to be a conversation that happens with the academic member of staff with the first five or six weeks.  There is something to discuss about assessment.

Parents who have children of college-going age are very conscious of mental health issues, as they are aware of their child as a whole person.<\/p> <p>  This is a good question, but let me be specific in the way I answer it.  I teach a skill subject, and the language I teach is French.  As well as being a lecturer, I am also a tutor and I take small groups and seminars.  These students have to be taught a laboratory subject in small groups.  One is interacting with small groups of students.  Everybody knows that is where the pressure is at third level.  If I were president, I would put more emphasis on small group teaching, more emphasis on the students handing in work.  Certainly, at third year, I would be correcting a piece of written work from my students every week - that is, ten or 11 pieces of written work.  They get feedback on their written work.  They do oral work, so they are talking about themselves.  There is a high level of contact.   I was at an exam board meeting this morning before I came to this committee meeting.  One of my students, who is borderline, sent me nine worrybug e-mails about what she needs to be doing.

If we do not have that, all the talk about a knowledge economy is nonsense.  Second, this will sound funny coming from an engineer working in a so-called STEM area, I have spoken to career guidance teachers about this and I am aware that secondary school leavers feel badgered into doing STEM courses.  It is coding, coding and more coding.  Having done coding, these disciplines are real minority tastes and do not appeal to everybody.  If one considers what the best-performing students in our universities are studying, it is often the humanities at which they excel.  I worry that, as a country, we are becoming obsessed with STEM.  It is such a broad term and people are studying biology, physics, coding and they are all different.  What I would love the Minister to do is to set up a working group in which he talks to recently qualified graduates who have made the transition from B.Sc or PhD into the workplace.  Nobody over 35 years should be invited.  If one talks to recently qualified PhD students in the STEM area, they will give one a very different perspective from the spin about the knowledge economy.  That is trickling down to school leavers.  I have one career guidance teacher from Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona in Glasnevin who tells me that her students feel they have to do maths because of STEM.  They feel the economy will fall apart if they do not study STEM subjects.  I would like to get a really good sense of what the economy needs.  Do we all have to be fantastic at maths?

I reiterate our commitment to serving rural Ireland and connecting the people in these communities with the wider network.  As the biggest provider of rural transport in the country, almost 10,000 people help to deliver our services every day.  We are proud to be associated with the provision of jobs in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As is any service industry, we are very reliant on our employees, whose dedication and commitment is among the highest In Ireland.  More than 80% of our staff are customer facing, and last year we were very proud to be recognised by the Reputation Institute as having the 42nd best reputation in the country.  We had the second biggest increase in placing among the top 100 companies in Ireland.  This is entirely down to the attitude, commitment and competence of our people, who went to extraordinary lengths again during recent weather events to keep the travelling public connected in most of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, Bus &Eacute;ireann had almost 80,000 passenger trips, including those by school-going children.  This demonstrates the critical role our organisation plays as part of the social and economic fabric of Ireland.  In 2015, we successfully completed the first year of a new five year direct award contract with the NTA, and began a number of projects under that contract which will bring enhanced customer service standards and technology improvements to the business.  We secured funding for 116 new vehicles, which we launched last week.  These will bring higher capacity and comfort to our customers.  Our network improvements and marketing helped to deliver 700,000 extra passenger journeys, and we increased our focus on the customer, setting up a new customer care facility, beginning work on Colbert station in Limerick and reinforcing our commitment to safety above all, through a new school transport campaign aimed at raising seat belt awareness among young children.<\/p><p>All of these initiatives underpin our ambition to be recognised as progressive and deliver on our mission, which is to succeed by providing an excellent service to the public.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway network is a separate commercial service that receives no State funding.  Our fleet livery is familiar, as one sees the big red coaches traversing the country.  The Expressway network comprises 23 interregional routes which operate throughout the country, linking cities and population hubs, and must generate its own funds for necessary investment in fleet, customer service, technology improvements and marketing.<\/p><p> The environment in which we operate these Expressway services has become increasingly competitive, comprising a significant number of other coach companies.  In addition, customers from bigger population centres demand faster journey times with fewer stops, more use of the motorway network and more direct connections to larger population centres.  We have seen new licences granted for routes, and this issue is a matter of utmost concern for our board and management.  The NTA now performs a difficult role with regard to licence issuing and connectivity of the network.  We assist it when necessary, when routes are being designed or realigned, but ultimate responsibility for ensuring connectivity among all of the public transport alternatives now rests with the NTA, and not with Bus &Eacute;ireann, since our legal roles changed in 2009.<\/p><p> As Bus &Eacute;ireann operates more than 300 city and stage carriage routes under public contract with the NTA, we connect thousands of locations and customers on a daily basis, ensuring city and rural stage carriage services are dovetailed with Expressway and other public transport services where it is possible to do so, providing a vast integrated bus and coach network throughout Ireland.<\/p><p> Having addressed the committee last March, we worked closely with the NTA and a solution was provided for the towns affected by our commercial decision to withdraw from Expressway route 5, from Waterford to Dublin through Wicklow, and to curtail our Expressway route 7, originally from Dublin to Cork through Clonmel.  The network solution involved a redesign of our public service routes 132 in Wicklow and 245 between Cork and Mitchelstown, both of which are operated under subsidy as part of our public service contract.  These routes, together with some integrated connections provided by Local Link, which is the rural transport scheme contracted by the NTA and provided under subsidy, perform a role to ensure the people in these communities remain connected.  In this example, the transition from the non-commercial segments of Expressway to public service obligation, PSO, services, has been successful and the subsidisation required is now more prudently aligned with the customer demand in these smaller towns and villages, and not left to our Expressway business to shoulder.<\/p><p> Expressway cannot afford to endlessly provide service on routes which will never deliver a financial contribution and this is a fundamental tenet of being commercial on our interregional and intercity services.  As part of this decision-making ethos in recent years, difficult decisions were necessary and our Expressway services were withdrawn from approximately 20% of secondary locations where customer demand did not exist or did not cover the costs of providing the Expressway service.  That said, through working with the NTA we assure the committee there has been no widespread loss of services to rural locations as a result of the decisions we have made.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland, and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network.<\/p><p> We previously advised the committee that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in survival mode in recent years.  The company worked its way out of the recession and remains committed to work with its stakeholders to deliver the best possible transport system, in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  The pace of economic recovery requires increased public transport levels, and this will require support to foster social and economic inclusion.  With regard to PSO services provided under contract to the NTA, we are pleased there is recognition emerging that the PSO subvention to operate the levels of PSO service requires more funding.  In 2015, we made substantial progress on developing our services in conjunction with the NTA, and we have seen substantial growth in passenger numbers in the markets we provide.  We recently received an additional allocation for 2015, which covered the cost of the services.  We have been advised that the level of funding in 2016 will match our costs and we await final confirmation on the capital side.  We will submit our own application for the 10% of our services being tendered as part of the PSO market opening later this year.<\/p><p> I shared our concerns regarding the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages during our visits to this forum in 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2015.  I also advised that changes to a number of our commercial Expressway intercity routes were required to ensure their survival.  Nothing has changed in this regard, and, in fact, competition on Expressway routes has increased.<\/p><p>With competition increasing, we must continue to ensure the Expressway service is as cost efficient as possible.  The reversal of the 18-month cost-saving agreement with our staff came to an end in 2014 and, taken together with the work stoppage in May of last year, this affected the bottom line and had a very serious impact on our profitability last year.  Expressway broke even in 2014.  Despite savings achieved through various changes, we will be in loss in 2015, which adds financial pressure to our concern.<\/p><p> The board and the management team are committed to examining ways in which to reduce costs to deliver the profitability necessary to secure a viable future for Expressway.  This business requires investment in customer service, fleet, marketing and innovation, and we must create an efficient and cost-effective business model to achieve this.  The matter was discussed at the recent Bus &Eacute;ireann board meeting and the management team has been tasked with bringing a comprehensive strategic plan for Expressway to the board as quickly as possible and to keep the board appraised of progress.  As a company, if we do not make changes and consequently lose the flexibility to respond to the licensing environment which continues to unfold, Expressway will go out of business and jobs will be lost.<\/p><p> I reiterate that Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network given the financial resources available.  Expressway is part of the wider national integrated network but it still operates in a small economy with a high rural constituency.  Our focus as a management team is on preserving and growing Expressway which delivers a significant social dividend to the State through the provision of services not otherwise provided to many regional locations.  We will continue to work in a collaborative and inclusive way with our employees to ensure Expressway is put on a sustainable footing but we must also act to protect the future interests of all stakeholders in this business in a market which has become increasingly competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan for his contribution.

I understand the joint committee wishes to focus on two areas in particular, first, the interurban and Expressway commercial bus services and, second, the co-ordination of rural transport services with the Expressway network.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions, I am joined by Tim Gaston who manages public transport services in the authority.<br\/><br\/>Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I wish to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority.  The remit of the National Transport Authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  These include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.<br\/><br\/>The authority is responsible for securing the provision of public bus services through two specified mechanisms: public service contracts where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis and the licensing of public bus services which are operated on a commercial basis.  In licensing commercial bus services, it is important to note that the relevant legislation requires the authority to seek to achieve, in the public interest, regulated competition in the provision of such services.<br\/><br\/>On the specific areas of focus raised by the committee, bus services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann under its Expressway brand are commercial services and are licensed by the authority in exactly the same manner as all other commercial bus services.  Licences set out the nature of the service and conditions under which licensed public bus passenger services must operate, such as the point of origin and destination as well as timetable and stopping place details<b>.<\/b>The majority of interurban services, including those between the regional cities and Dublin city and Dublin Airport, are provided on a commercial basis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and a number of private operators provide these services which are licensed by the authority.<br\/><br\/>In exercising its functions the authority seeks to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus or transport mode, or both, is required.  This includes the operation of rural transport services, operated as Local Link, which can facilitate connecting to mainline interurban services, irrespective of the provider of those services, and including, but not limited to, Expressway.  The objective of the rural transport programme is to provide a good quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  In 2015, funding of &euro;10.7 million was provided through the authority for the programme.<\/p><p> The rural transport programme came under the aegis of the authority in April 2012.  The programme was initially managed by Pobal on behalf of the authority but since January 2014 is now directly managed by the authority.  A restructuring strategy was launched in July 2013.  Since assuming responsibility, we have focused on restructuring the programme to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness.  The restructuring programme included the establishment of 17 transport co-ordination units which replaced the 35 rural transport groups previously managing the programme.  Local passenger services are managed by the relevant transport co-ordination unit in each area on the authority's behalf.  This restructuring has positioned the programme to better integrate with other public transport services, and provides a solid base to expand or adapt services to meet current and future identified needs.<\/p><p> Now that the organisational restructuring has been completed, we are focused on optimising the services provided within the funding envelope available.  A review of services is currently in progress to ensure that they are meeting user requirements and our objectives.  <\/p><p> Transport co-ordination units work closely with the local authorities on the assessment of local transport needs, including those people who are socially excluded.  With the benefit of this local collaboration, we expect to make considerable progress in 2016 on refining and expanding, where appropriate, the operation of local transport services, in addition to ensuring the optimal level of integration with the other public transport services.<\/p><p> That concludes my introductory presentation.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.

Mr. Nolan indicated that the service made a loss in 2015.  I understand the accounts for 2015 have not been fully prepared but will he indicate the scale of the projected losses and the impact this will have in 2016?  Does Mr. Nolan think that Bus &Eacute;ireann will be able to bring its cost structure in line with its revenues for 2016 or is the company projecting a loss by the Expressway service for the year?  In his presentation, Mr Nolan states that the company operates in an increasingly competitive environment with ever-expanding activity on some of the routes.  I would have hoped that the increase in passenger activity would have helped to address some of the increased competition but clearly that is not the case.  Will he elaborate on the nature of the competitive environment in which the service operates?  Has saturation point been reached on some routes?  Is the competition that is required under legislation reaching a point where it is making it difficult for all concerned to survive on certain routes?  Obviously, there are wider implications in a competitive environment because it could ultimately lead to a deterioration in services.  We know what happens when the point of saturation is reached, namely, it effectively becomes a race to the bottom and the service is diminished.  The customer is the obvious loser in the long term.  My concern, based on what Mr. Nolan said, is that we may be at the start of the road to that ultimate outcome.  I would like Mr. Nolan to address this matter.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.  I have had the opportunity to discuss with the NTA on a number of occasions the very good work it does in attempting to put in place a national plan for the delivery of public transport services, both in terms of the licensing remit and managing the public service obligation element.  What criteria are in place to ensure that the issuance of licences will not result in an over saturation of a particular market to the point where it will not be financially viable for operators to survive?<\/p><p>Often, one can let the market decide and try to pick up the pieces thereafter.  This is a regulated environment, after all.  The witnesses do not need me to tell them about the requirement to try to ensure there is a viable market, as opposed to a predatory approach that would ultimately lead to a race to the bottom.  What kinds of checks and balances are in place?  What type of testing is done?  What advice do the witnesses have for the Legislature?  What should operators like Mr. Nolan do to ensure this eventuality does not arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#L00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>A number of low-cost no-frills operators have entered this heavily competitive market in recent years.

All of those figures are approximate.  It is clear that a commercial operation which is not in a profitable position needs to be addressed quickly.  That is why we have asked the executive to come up with a very comprehensive strategic plan, which we will discuss in a collaborative fashion with our stakeholders, particularly our employees and their representatives, to ensure we have a route to continued profitability and sustainability for the Expressway network into the future.  This is an important element of the matter.  We have invested heavily in new coaches.  We do not use second-hand coaches on our network.  We have invested heavily to ensure our branding is clear and easily distinguished to attract as many consumers to our product as possible.  With regard to competition, I accept that we are in a very competitive environment.  We provide just 18% of the services on the Dublin-Limerick route, for example.

We would argue that we have the numbers to illustrate that we have been able to increase the total public transport market by means of controlled and regulated competition.  There are many examples of corridors where we have chosen not to continue to grant licences or amendments because we believe they are adequately provided for.  We have taken both actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan and Mr. Creegan for their presentations.  I would like to begin by asking about the issue of school runs.  How often are the routes reviewed?  I recently met the family of a five year old boy in respect of whom an application was made in advance of his starting school.  They were told he would be on the bus route and they made the relevant payment, but when they went to the private provider, they were told he would have to be picked up a kilometre up the road.  Obviously, a five year old boy is not going to walk that far.  His mother feels that if she has to put him into the car, she might as well drive him to school.  When we did a bit of investigating, we found that a private coach operator had been hired by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Obviously, this operator must take the route it has been told to take.  The members of the boy's family did their own investigation and provided a new route, which is safe, is a kilometre shorter and goes past their door.  They asked for this to be looked at, but their request was not even addressed.  I wonder how often the routes are reviewed.  If a solution is found, as it was in this instance, can it be looked at or are these matters set in stone?<\/p> <p>  Obviously, as Deputy Dooley has said, the witnesses have a very difficult job.  People are happy with express routes because they want to get to or from work, but such routes often leave out people in smaller towns who want to get connected.  Mr. Nolan gave an example of a case in which a solution was found by looking at other routes and rearranging them.  Is that being done for all the routes that have been changed?  For example, the 115 route between Dublin and Mullingar used to cover the area between Dunboyne and Summerhill in County Meath, but four locations - Moynalvey, Culmullen, Kilcloon and Baytown - are now excluded and the people in those places feel they are being left out.  Do the witnesses review cases like that?  Do they look to see what other services might be provided for the people of such areas?<\/p> <p>  How are the prices for the various routes decided?  I would have regularly travelled from Navan to Dublin when I was younger and when I was in college.  I know that a one-way ticket from Navan to Dublin now costs more than &euro;11, whereas one could travel a lot further down the country for a lot less.<\/p><p>Is it decided on the basis of proximity or the number of people who use the route?  How is it arrived at?<\/p><p> If a new bus stop is being sought on a route, what are the requirements?  We have a number of requests in Navan where a service is required.  How can people apply for that and how is it decided?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#N00700","speaker":"1180","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>On the Navan route, we do that under contract to the NTA so both of us will come in on that.<\/p> <p>  We review school routes constantly.

On the question of a five-year old child having to walk 1 km, I would probably be concerned about that myself.  In general, we try to pick up primary school children as close to their homes as possible.  We also have pick-up points for post-primary students.  If the Deputy gives me the details, I will examine the specific case.<\/p> <p>  There have been changes on the 115 route in conjunction with the NTA.

The NTA also comes to us with its changes and Mr. Tim Gaston will come in on that.  Prices are all agreed with the NTA.  In general, it depends on the number of people on the route and the distance they are from the location.  On the Navan route, there is a great deal of peak time travel.  It is more expensive to put peak time travel in when there is a lack of business during the day.  On Expressway or intercity routes, there is business all day.

The Deputy referred to network reviews.  We have a group within the NTA whose sole purpose is to review the networks continually.  We are taking on board comments being made in respect of the entire range of issues.  As well as detailed discussion with Bus &Eacute;ireann and looking at the bus loadings, we also take account of what other local provision there is in the area.  With the NTA also having responsibility for rural transport, we are working increasingly to dovetail the services.  As such, where a PSO operates or changes are introduced prior to that, we will discuss it with local transport co-ordination unit management to see and ensure that communities continue to be served.  As such, networks are being reviewed on a regular basis and the two teams - our own and Bus &Eacute;ireann's - meet on a very regular basis to see where we can bring about improvements.  Improvements are not really driven by the bottom line either.  They are actually about providing a better service through the day, through the week, through the time of day and in terms of the geography.  Of course, we have to take account of changes in geography and the community.  It is very much an ongoing process.  If there are specific queries members want us to address, they should let us know and we will come back to them on those.<\/p> <p>  Fares for public service obligation services are determined by the authority.  Again, we engage in detailed discussions with operators and model - in advance of a determination - the fare increases to see if they are appropriate and what will be the fare adjustment.  We are in the middle of an exercise involving a number of areas of the country to see if we can move towards a more equitable fares basis nationally.  It is a difficult challenge to meet, of course, and it is something that it will take a number of years to put in place.  If one looks at our fares determination issued last year, one will see that in some areas there were very small increases as we are setting about rebalancing fares.  It is something we look at very closely with the operators.  While we look at the loadings, fares in Ireland are based, by and large, on distance.  Within the eastern region, there is a zoning arrangement with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Since we have rolled out the Leap card in the eastern region, significant discounts have been available to those who choose to use them to travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann and other services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The tax-saver product allows people to get the service at half the price we are talking about.

We had a lot of complaints from people in the communities along the routes.<\/p> <p>  Tendering for some of the routes was mentioned.  I remember that when we argued about this before, the Government was talking about putting 10% out to tender.  However 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in Waterford was mentioned.  If we are going to tender those and will give up 100%, what are we aiming to do in Waterford?  I would like to know what we are trying to do.  Is it the intention to privatise that whole section or is Bus &Eacute;ireann going to tender for the service also?  I would like that to be explained to me because I find it a bit contradictory.<\/p> <p>  Have there been huge savings in fuel costs?  I would have thought that there would have been massive savings with the way fuel prices have gone which would have helped in terms of targets.  The Minister tells us that the PSO is remaining the same.  When I was reading some of this earlier, I noted that there were to be changes in the PSO for Kerry and Mayo.  Those are planned to be implemented in the near future.  How will that impact on those areas?  Will the changes affect services and will there be cutbacks in some of the routes?  Will the routes be more direct?<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses explain how the community has an input in all of this?  Do people go out to talk to the community?  What way is it done?

Passenger numbers on the PSO side have been very good in the last number of years, but it has been patchy in some areas.  There is more growth in Dublin and Cork than in rural Ireland.  The provincial cities grew by 4% last year and Cork alone is up by 8% or 9% in the last couple of months.  We anticipate similar growth this year.  The vehicles that are coming in will be deployed across the whole network, but there are specific places that require additional capacity.  We are putting additional double-deck vehicles into Cork and taking out single-deck vehicles.  There will be additional capacity around the greater Dublin area given what has happened in terms of congestion.

It is correct that there were a number of public consultation meetings and representations were made to us, to Bus &Eacute;ireann and to others at the time.  We organised a number of discussions and then reviewed the entire network requirements in those immediate areas.  We came in with a package of services that would deliver to the communities that were being impacted on by the withdrawals.  There were three main way by which we delivered.  We modified some of the PSO services in those areas to bring in additional communities.  Through discussions with the transport co-ordination units, we also put additional funding, something of the order of &euro;300,000, into the rural network to support additional services in that area.  We also took out a couple of small services that were not being met by either of those two options.  We went to the market and providers came in and those services are now up and running, all being provided by local businesses.  Through a network of mechanisms and packages of solutions we had, we were able to configure things to provide services to those communities.  The level of commentary back to the National Roads Authority has fallen very significantly.  We would consider that to be a successful delivery.<\/p> <p>  On the question of tendering of routes, a decision was made to tender 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann services to the open market.  The process of tendering really required us to put together packages of services that could be delivered by another provider coming in, so the decision was made to take 10% and split it into two specific packages on the Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  One of those packages is a number of the services in the Waterford area.  When a new provider is coming in, it makes sense that it should have a locality in which to have a base.  We have chosen two for the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus market opening exercise, the Waterford area and the Kildare corridor.  About 7% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be the Kildare corridor services and about 3% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be in Waterford.  Those packages were put out to the market last year and that procurement is still continuing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy asked specifically about PSO funding.  Mr. Martin Nolan has touched on this in his response.  In fact, the Department and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have granted the NTA additional PSO funding for 2016.  We are in the process of again working with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and the transport co-ordination units to see where we can expand and bring in additional services.  The Kerry area was reviewed last year and an additional network of services was provided in Kerry to bring about improvements.  We are looking at present at a number of other geographical areas across the country, which we will bring in as quickly as can be done sensibly within the PSO and the rural transport network, using the transport co-ordination units.  <\/p> <p>  On the question of community input, that comes in a number of ways.  Representations come to the National Roads Authority and we regularly meet community groups, local representatives and so on.  One of the strengths of the rural programme continues to be the extent to which local people are involved in the transport co-ordination units, TCUs.  Each TCU has its own board, comprising people who give of their time voluntarily to contribute to the discussions as to how best those local needs are meet.  We then contribute to the funding of their services and we give guidelines and get involved in network planning where it is appropriate to dovetail with other services.<\/p><p>The vast majority of the decisions that are important to the local community are made by the management of the transport co-ordination units, TCUs, guided by their local board.

Bus &Eacute;ireann buys diesel in advance at &euro;1.20 per litre.  The price of diesel is now down to 99.8 cent a litre in places.  When it falls lower than that, will the company buy enough in bulk in order that it might save a great deal of money down the road?  The price of oil is expected to fall to somewhere between $22 and $24 dollars.  When the opportunity arises, will the company make sure it buys enough diesel in advance?  A group appeared before the committee recently to discuss natural gas and Ireland's move to a low-carbon economy.  They said buses would move to natural gas.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann buying buses with that facility?  It costs &euro;18,000 to install the relevant technology.<\/p> <p>  On school transport, why was the old school rule abolished?  It is causing many problems around the country.  Another problem that crops up here and there, which I am sure every Deputy has encountered, is children attending schools that are further away from them than others.  I am familiar with cases of bullying and other problems which meant the children had to move to other schools and they had to pay for their bus tickets.

If the cost has reduced from &euro;1.50 to &euro;1, the revenue potential is a little bit lower, so it is back to giving the bus an advantage over the car, so that we can all move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Is Bus &Eacute;ireann VAT exempt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>We are zero rated which means we cannot reclaim our VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>VAT is included in Bus &Eacute;ireann's fuel cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V00900","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>How much fuel in money terms does Bus &Eacute;ireann use in the year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01000","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>We spend about &euro;27 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>So the company cannot claim back the VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>No, but we do get a small fuel rebate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Those with lorries get that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01400","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>That is the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>There is &euro;5 million in VAT that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not allowed to claim back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#V01600","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The big saving in bus transport is getting 50 people out of a car on to a bus; even if it is a 20 year old bus, it will save more.

Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have smaller buses than the 45 seaters?  There is a service that goes from Cavan through Leitrim down to Sligo on a Saturday morning.  I see it nearly every Saturday morning around 10 a.m. and there would not be any more than 15 or 20 people on this big 45 seater bus.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann looked at similar routes across the country and considered introducing smaller buses?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the NTA and perhaps it might be better if I was to talk to the witnesses privately about Westlink Coaches, who are currently in a tangle over licensing of a route.  To put it simply, they are allowed to carry university students from Leitrim through Roscommon to Galway university, where they drop them near the campus.  However, they are not allowed to pick up the same passengers on a Sunday evening going through Castlerea, Ballygar, Williamstown and Dunmore.  There is another operator on that route.  They have lodged an appeal because it seems their last appeal was turned down on the basis that there were insufficient numbers.  They have now provided further numbers coming from NUIG, GMIT and they are also being told by NTA that there is a Bus &Eacute;ireann service operating on the same route.<\/p><p>That Bus &Eacute;ireann route goes all over the country, going into Ballyhaunis and into Mayo, yet as we know the students want to get home.  I wish to raise this issue and I am just flagging it as I would like to talk privately to somebody about it afterwards.  This operator is providing more than 20 jobs in Drumshanbo, a small town of 800 people.  It would be devastating if he were to lose out.  It does not make sense to me that he is allowed to bring passengers from Drumshanbo through Roscommon and Galway into NUIG and yet not allowed to bring passengers whom he picks up in Castlerea because a licence was given to another operator.  This issue needs to be examined.  I was with the Minister when he was in Leitrim recently.  He promised the people from Westlink he would contact the witnesses about this.  I would like to have this issue addressed sooner rather later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#W01100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>The Senator can raise it privately afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#X00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1453282200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>What about the fleet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2016012000002#X00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1453282200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>On a Saturday morning one would have full loads early in the morning but in the course of the day, fewer people would travel on the bus.
