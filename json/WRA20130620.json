The profiling of monthly cash drawdown requirements from annual capital allocations is essentially an administrative exercise.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.<\/p><p>  An overall variance from the capital expenditure profile of between 10% and 12% is not unusual and within that variance there can be variations in spending patterns between Departments with some ahead of target.  Departments have indicated that they do not expect any significant savings by year end and so expenditure is expected to return to profile at that stage.<\/p><p>All Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis in relation to their actual expenditure (both capital and current) compared with their published profiles and to explain variances where they arise.

Co. that they carried out emergency works including the construction of a berm at Vesey Park to prevent the river bursting its banks onto the Adamstown Road. Two engineering reports in 2001 commissioned by them on the 2000 flood event recommended the upgrading of the river channel and bridges on the Griffeen River to provide conveyance capacity for the 100-year flood event. These works were completed in 2004 at a cost of &euro;5m.  <\/p><p>  The Council, in association with Chartridge Ltd, the developers of the Adamstown SDZ lands, also completed a scheme in August 2009 to alleviate flooding in the Tubber Lane area. This consisted of works in the Tubbermaclugg Stream, the provision of an attenuation pond and upgrading of culverts and pipework.   The scheme which is designed to protect against the 100 year flood event cost &euro;7.7m and the costs were shared by the Council and Chartridge Ltd.   <\/p><p>  The significant works that have been carried out have been successful in that no house has been flooded by river water in Lucan since 2000.<\/p><p>  The area from Lucan through to Chapelizod is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) in the Eastern Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study which is being carried out by RPS Consultants. The rivers Liffey and Griffeen are High Priority Watercourses through the AFA. Draft flood mapping for the Eastern CFRAM Study will be made available in late 2013, with the Flood Risk Management Plan being available in late 2015. <\/p><p>  The River Camac is a High Priority Watercourse in the Eastern CFRAM Study through Clondalkin.  Following the October 2011 flood event, the OPW, following discussions with South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council, requested RPS consultants to prioritise the assessment under the CFRAM of the Camac and Poddle catchments.  This work has been progressed to the point where draft flood mapping and any identified viable options are being made available for public consultation in the week beginning on 24 June 2013.  Advertisements have been placed in local papers, and I would strongly urge members of the public to attend these events and give their views.<\/p><p>In relation to flooding events in the past 10 years, I would suggest that the information is publicly available on the OPW website .  The Lucan and Clondalkin areas were affected by flooding arising from the intense rainfall event that occurred in the Dublin and Eastern region on 24 October 2011. This was a pluvial rather than a river based event and it affected primarily industrial property and roads in the areas.  Apart from the Oct 2011 event, the only other flood event recorded on the<i> floodmaps.ie<\/i>   website was one in October 2004 affecting Luttrellstown Golf Club.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the problems some homeowners in Lucan and Clondalkin have been experiencing in relation to flood insurance cover.  This is occurring in other areas of the country also.   I have made it clear on many occasions that where the State, through the OPW or the local authorities, has completed flood defence works in an area, then those works should be taken into account by the insurance companies when assessing properties in those areas for flood insurance cover.   For this reason I initiated discussions with the insurance industry with a view to establishing a system for providing information to the insurance companies on all completed OPW flood defence schemes.   A Working Group comprising of  officials of the OPW, Insure Ireland (formerly the Irish Insurance Federation) and representatives of the main household insurance companies has been engaged in discussions over the last six months to reach agreement on a basis for providing this information. The Working Group is very near completion of its work.   I expect that an agreement with the insurance industry in this regard will be a clear positive step to address the problems which some householders are experiencing.  The focus of the Working Group initially has been on completed OPW flood defence schemes but it will be addressing completed local authority works in the near future.   It is important to bear in mind that while the insurance companies may agree to take the information on completed flood defence schemes into account, ultimately, it is a commercial decision on the part of the companies as to whether they offer flood cover and at what price.<\/p><p>  I would point out also that the CFRAM process will produce a significant amount of information in relation to flood risk which will be available to the insurance industry also and will enable the industry to take decisions on the provision of cover based on the fullest possible assessment of that risk.<\/p><p>  Those having difficulty with flood insurance cover can direct queries and complaints in this regard through Insurance Ireland's free Insurance Information Service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[29658\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of jobs that have been created from the July 2012 stimulus plan to date in 2013; the number of jobs that will be created from the plan by the end of 2013 and 2014.","asker":"976","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>On the 17th of July 2012, the Government announced its plans for an additional &euro;2.25 billion investment in public infrastructure projects in Ireland. The most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will recall, the stimulus package included &euro;1.4 billion to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme and the delivery of this was the initial focus for my Department.  This &euro;1.4 billion investment is additional to the direct investment by the exchequer in infrastructure which will be some &euro;3.4 billion in 2013. <\/p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government. Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs spread out across the country. Analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline should generate around 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs. It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.   In recent weeks, as a follow on to last year's package, I announced an additional Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. These projects involve mostly smaller scale capital works which are known to be labour intensive. It is envisaged that this additional Exchequer investment can support in the region of 3,000 jobs over the period of the roll-out. <\/p><p>  NDFA issued tenders for the schools bundles in May. The tender for the Primary Care Centres Bundle is expected to be issued in August followed by the Grangegorman tender in September.   The NRA published the contract notice for the N25 New Ross Bypass in March.  The return date for pre-qualification submissions was 19th June and the NRA has reported that five submissions were received.  The NRA will now proceed with the evaluation of the pre-qualification submissions received.  It is planned to announce the shortlisted consortia to proceed to the tender stage in July\/August. The next road tender will issue in the coming months.   <\/p><p>  As part of the on-going monitoring of employment on current PPPs, the latest figures from the Schools Bundle 3 indicate 600 full time equivalent jobs engaged for the period to end May.   We will also be monitoring the level of employment being created during the construction of the N11\/Newlands Cross PPP which commenced in the past few weeks.    <\/p><p>  The preparatory work for the PPP projects is well underway in the various Departments and Agencies. At this early stage in the process, most of the employment impact has been in the technical and advisory areas. <\/p><p>  The NDFA estimated that approximately 155 jobs have been created to date by technical, legal, and insurance advisors and design teams spread across all projects. Some projects such as the new DIT Grangegorman project have already seen significant employment impact where a team of 40 architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and other specialists are already in place. Similarly in relation to the schools and primary care centres, a number of technical advisors and design teams are in place. <\/p><p>  Further appointments are pending and employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and construction gets underway. The indicative timetable for the projects suggests construction is expected to commence on the first roads project by the end of 2013 and on the accommodation projects by Q4 2014.  <\/p><p>  My Department together with the NDFA and the Sponsoring Authorities are also looking at how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition that is in line with procurement regulations. With the NDFA, we are also examining ways to encourage SME participation by facilitating access to the programme and the NDFA is working with Enterprise Ireland to organise awareness raising events for SMEs, one of which was held last week.<\/p><p>The projects identified for delivery through the additional &euro;150m Exchequer funding will begin to be rolled out over the summer. While this additional funding was only recently announced, I expect that it will have an immediate impact as most of the preparation work for the relevant projects is already well advanced.   <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redundancies","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[29676\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress made to date in implementing the targeted voluntary redundancy scheme within the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware this Government is committed to developing a leaner, more efficient Public Service. To this end, we agreed on 2 October 2012 to accelerate the reduction in Public Service numbers in order to achieve the previous end 2015 target of 282,500 by end 2014 instead. Greater efficiencies in the way the Public Service is going about its business means that some posts have been identified by Departments as surplus.  Where surplus staff cannot be redeployed, Voluntary Redundancy can be used. There is not a general voluntary redundancy scheme in the Public Service; it is progressing on a targeted basis where it makes sense and can be shown to offer value for money in the long run.<\/p><p>  Initially Voluntary Redundancy is being rolled out in three areas - the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and specific parts of the Health and Education Sectors.  These Departments estimated at the time the matter was being considered that there would be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from these areas over time, mainly from back office and support areas and management and administrative grades.  <\/p><p>  Last month the Department of Health issued a circular to the HSE authorising the introduction of a Targeted Voluntary Redundancy Scheme funded by the HSE from within existing resources.   <\/p><p>  With regard to the Education Sector, some very limited targeted voluntary redundancies have taken place and further areas are under consideration.<\/p><p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is facilitating the redeployment of staff to other Departments and agencies where there is a current demand for additional resources and once this programme of redeployments is completed it will finalise the business case for its voluntary redundancy scheme, which will specify posts and locations to be targeted.<\/p><p>  Voluntary Redundancy may be used as a lever for facilitating organisational change in those areas of the Public Service where surplus staff cannot be reassigned within their Department\/Sector.  Each Department must submit a detailed business case to my Department prior to sanction being considered.<\/p><p>  Voluntary redundancy will contribute to the overall reduction in public service numbers which are collated on a quarterly basis by my Department.<\/p><p>  The intention is that voluntary redundancy is only to be used where there is no other realistic option, such as redeploying or retraining existing staff. It was always intended to be relatively small scale and targeted. It is a response to business needs rather than an open general scheme. One would expect that there will be increased take up as we move along and sectoral managers progress reform and restructuring initiatives.<\/p><p>  What sectors\/areas\/Departments\/agencies will be targeted for redundancies?<\/p><p>  It is open for any Department \/ Sector of the Public Service to put forward proposals, backed by a sound business case, to introduce VR in their particular areas.  In order to proceed Departments have to submit a detailed business case to my Department - including the purpose, the reform and workforce planning context, the cost and savings - before sanction  to proceed is given. In considering the business case, the cost to the Exchequer is assessed and factored into affordability decisions on a case-by-case basis.  <\/p><p>  How much will the redundancies cost and where will the funds come from?<\/p><p>  Analysis by my Department estimates that for every 1,000 employees who opt to participate in a voluntary redundancy programme there will be a gross cost of approximately &euro;109 million.   The gross payroll savings for 1,000 employees will amount to &euro;57 million every year.  Therefore the initial cost of 1,000 employees leaving would be recouped in two years. Further savings will be realised in the future when these employees reach retirement age, because of their reduced pension entitlements. <\/p><p>  Final decisions on numbers reductions to be achieved in each sector will take account of the surpluses identified by Ministers in respect of their portfolios and of expected rates of retirements in those sectors, Departments and Offices over the next few years.  In addition the grades and service profiles of staff will need to be ascertained.  This will determine the eventual costs.   It is proposed that redundancy costs of this scheme will be borne, in the first instance, by the relevant Departments within existing resources.  <\/p><p>  What are the terms of the Redundancy scheme?<\/p><p>  The terms of VR will be in accordance with the Collective Agreement with the Public Service Committee of ICTU on Redundancy Payments to Public Servants.  The redundancy payment consists of an ex gratia payment of 3 weeks' pay per year of service plus statutory redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts, subject to an overall limit of:<\/p><p>(i)  2 years' pay; or, if less<\/p><p>(ii) one-half of the salary payable to preserved pension age<\/p><p>  Voluntary redundancy is allowed for under the terms of the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park). <\/p><p>  What is the target number of redundancies under the scheme announced in October 2012?<\/p><p>  It is estimated that the currently proposed schemes (Health, Agriculture and Education sectors) will result in some 2,000 exits from these areas. There is no pre-defined target. Each case will be assessed on merit as to whether it is affordable and meets VFM criteria.<\/p><p>  When did the scheme commence and when will the first staff depart?<\/p><p>  Voluntary Redundancy was agreed by Government as a means of managing those situations where staff cannot be redeployed. Rather than being a general scheme of voluntary redundancy across the Public Service, VR is being introduced on a rolling basis where Departments and Agencies identify surplus staff, put forward a business case and receive sanction from my Department to use VR as a tool in implementing restructuring and reform.  <\/p><p>  Will staff be forced to take this Redundancy Scheme? Is this not compulsory redundancy?<\/p><p>  This scheme is a voluntary redundancy scheme. The Department\/employer may invite individuals who are surplus and work in targeted areas \/ positions to apply for voluntary redundancy.  It is entirely a voluntary decision for the individual as to whether or not to apply or accept such an offer. <\/p><p>  Will frontline services be protected\/how will managers ensure the ongoing business needs of Departments\/agencies are met?<\/p><p>  There will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be subject to ongoing business needs. Skills needs and the priorities of Departments will be central considerations when assessing applications. All areas of the Public Service will be required to implement the redeployment arrangements set out in the Public Service Agreement thereby ensuring frontline and critical services are maintained to the highest standards.<\/p><p>  Will any of the posts vacated by redundancy be filled by new staff coming in?<\/p><p>In line with the Government's policy of creating a leaner more efficient Public Service and to facilitate structural reform, staff departing under the voluntary scheme will not be replaced. Service levels will be maintained via reorganisation and implementation of the redeployment arrangements set out in the Public Service Agreement.  However in order to take account of the ongoing reform programme in the public service, it will always be necessary to have an ongoing level of recruitment into different parts of the public service.  <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Contracts","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[29673\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the criteria for the awarding of printing contracts by the State can be modified in line with EU procurement requirements to ensure that Irish based printers have improved opportunities to successfully tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process.  The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime that delivers value for money.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour, or discriminate against, particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies that may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p><p>  Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service.  In establishing these arrangements the NPS is particularly mindful of the provisions of Dept of Finance Circular 10\/10 that seeks to remove any potential barriers to the participation of SMEs in the public service procurement process.  These provisions include the need for proportionality, reduced administration (paperwork), the open advertising of all contracts over the value of &euro;25,000 etc.  In the case of printing the National Procurement Service has also established a panel of printers from which public bodies can easily access printing services. It is also the policy of the NPS to only aggregate contracts where it is apparent that such a strategy could yield optimum results.  In a situation where it is deemed more appropriate to bring smaller contracts individually to the market, without recourse to European competition, then this is the strategy pursued. This later approach can offer better opportunities for local suppliers to compete. <\/p><p>  It is noteworthy that all current NPS contracts for printing services are with Irish-based printers.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members on issues directly related to procurement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[29681\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will list the ten most valuable State properties liable for the local property tax in respect of which the State is not considering sale of the property; the valuation in each case and the amount of local property tax payable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>While the Office of Public Works has completed the returns to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the local property tax, the Commissioners are seeking legal advice on certain matters.

This cohort is responsible therefore for protecting National Monuments, performing various maintenance tasks and mounting larger conservation projects when appropriate.   A key role is also occupied by the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which has responsibility for overarching matters of policy relating to Heritage and provides a key professional Archaeological input into the protection regime at sites.  The Department is often therefore joined with the OPW in the first line of defence for Heritage sites under threat.   Additionally, the Minister for AHG and his Department is responsible for providing consent to allow works to be carried out at or in the vicinity of National Monuments, either by the OPW themselves or by others and this is a key function in providing clarity about who may work legally at a National Monument.<\/p><p>  The number of sites in State care is, clearly, quite significant and the challenge of ensuring that all sites are protected from adverse activity is a considerable one, particularly given that most are unattended by staff for a majority of the time.   Physically, the list is comprised of a huge range of types of structures including historic houses, ancient castles, Abbeys, Churches, megalithic burial and settlement sites, protected landscapes, battle sites, high crosses and other carved stones and a wide range of field monuments dotted around the country.   Geographically, the various sites and monuments are located in widely dispersed areas which are, in some cases easy to access and in others, physically remote.   OPW National Monuments staff regularly inspect sites to make sure they are not under threat and assess the need for small works from time to time.   In fact, the Deputy may recall the recent case where a Church font went missing from a National Monument site at Rathmore in Co. Meath.   The taking of this object was first noted in fact as a result of a routine OPW staff inspection.   Happily, that incident concluded satisfactorily and the item was sucessfully recovered, but it is noteworthy I think that the initial prompt action of OPW staff resulted in a very fast response by the Department of AHG and other relevant agencies,  in cooperation with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.   It is also interesting to note that the site in question is under Guardianship rather than ownership and that this did not affect the rigour of the protection or the speed of the response.<\/p><p>  Although the Rathmore incident ended happily, it does, I think, serve to illustrate the risks to our important heritage sites from unauthorised activity.   There is clearly a dilemma involved in publicising the wonderful heritage that we have and at the same time allowing access to individuals who, through either ill intent or a lack of knowledge, may cause damage.   Given the number and geographic spread of sites, the dangers involved cannot all be monitored all of the time and the OPW National Monuments Service depend on local people in all parts of the country to help keep a watch on sites and bring to the OPW's or the Department's attention any problem issues.   Where unauthorised activity occurs, the measures contained in the various National Monuments Acts will apply.   The sanctions set out in the Acts are significant and, with the input of the Department of AHG, provide a serious deterrent and a strong level of legal protection to sites under risk.   Notwithstanding this, my colleague the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a new National Monuments Amendment Act in preparation which he will bring to the House in due course to further update legislation in this area.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the importance of our National Heritage to both our cultural identity and as a part of the rich fabric of our nation, it is clear that its protection must be of continuing importance.   There are, clearly, challenges in terms of the size of the portfolio and the amount of resources available to the Office of Public Works;  however, I am generally happy that the OPW, in concert with colleagues in the Department of AHG and with the input and cooperation of interested local people and groups in all parts of the country, can continue to provide an effective response to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme Issues","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA02050"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[29648\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the announced &euro;150 million of additional Exchequer capital expenditure will be spent; the amount that will be spent in 2013 and 2014; the way he will ensure that it is not allocated to projects properly regarding as current expenditure; the number of jobs it will support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[29685\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of jobs he anticipates that will be created as a result of the recently announced &euro;150 million allocation in Exchequer capital funding for 2013 to 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 32 together.<\/p><p>  The projects identified for delivery through the additional &euro;150m Exchequer funding will begin to be rolled out over the summer.

Gross Gaming Revenues are defined as the level of sales <i>less<\/i> the amount deducted for prizes. The current licence does not have a specific formula in place for Good Causes - the level of contribution is the amount which remains when prizes and costs are deducted from the value of total sales.  <\/p><p>  An Post National Lottery Company recently published its Annual Report and Accounts for 2012.  Total sales recorded by the Company in 2012 amounted to approximately 735m euro while the funds allocated to prizes amounted to 406m euro.   Gross Gaming Revenues would therefore be equal to approximately 329m euro and 65% of that figure is around 214m euro. The actual contribution to Good Causes in 2012 was 225m euro.  <\/p><p>  However, I must stress that using this type of comparison as a guide to anticipating future revenues for Good Causes would be somewhat misleading. For example, under existing arrangements National Lottery sales have fallen and there is less money available for Good Causes.  Under the next licence, a competition for which is currently taking place, the National Lottery operator will be better placed to reverse this trend and boost the level of sales of National Lottery tickets.  This increase will be facilitated by the terms of both the next licence and the National Lottery Act 2013 which will offer the holder of the next licence greater flexibility for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels, including interactive channels.

However those providing finance to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) seek security which may include performance bonds as well as other financial securities.<\/p><p>  Previous PPP contracts which used the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) standard template Project Agreement included the provision of an &#8220;Authority Bond&#8221;.  This bond is called upon in the event that the project is terminated during construction as a result of a default by the SPV and is intended to cover the costs to the Authority of re-tendering the project.  The bond is required to be kept in place until a proportion of the works (usually about 25% of the value) is completed.  The bond is purchased by the SPV and appears as a cost to the Authority in the tender price.<\/p><p>  The requirement for the Authority Bond has been removed from the recently advertised Schools PPP Programme after a value-for-money assessment by the NDFA.  The NDFA is satisfied that sufficient remedy remains available under the contract to protect the State's interests in the event that the contract is terminated owing to a SPV default.  Removal of the requirement for the bond is expected to reduce tender prices.<\/p><p>  There are no other bonding requirements from the State within the PPP contract.  Instead, the SPV is at risk of financial deductions from the stage payments due under the PPP contract for any poor performance during the service period.  There is no proposal to alter these terms in the contract as they form an essential part of the risk-transfer mechanism.<\/p><p>Performance bonds are financial securities taken out by construction clients (public or private sector) to insure the contract performance against a default or breach by the contractor.  They are provided by specialist insurance companies (sureties).  In the case of a default or a breach of contract, the surety undertakes to cover <i>any additional costs<\/i>   up to the value of the bond incurred by the construction client in completing the project.  The premiums for the bonds are paid for by the client whereas security may be required by the surety from the contractor in addition to any premium paid.  The current cost of the premium can vary from 1.5% - 3.5% of the contract sum.<\/p><p>  On foot of concerns expressed by many in the industry over the difficulty in obtaining performance bonds on public works contracts, officials from my Department met with representatives of the construction industry, sureties and representatives of public sector contracting authorities in January of this year.<\/p><p>  During that engagement it became apparent that sureties were unwilling to continue to provide bonds at the levels traditionally sought by contracting authorities because of the increased level of insolvencies in the construction sector.  This was contributing to substantial delays and uncertainty in awarding contracts because the sureties were unable to meet the requirements set out in the tender documents which were based upon guidance set out in the Capital Works Management Framework published by my Department.<\/p><p>  In response to this uncertainty and having considered the options available, Circular 07\/13 was issued on 1 May 2013 reducing the level of performance bonds sought on public works contracts to 12.5% for contract sums up to &euro;10 million and 10% thereafter.

The primary purpose of the legislation is to implement the proposed pay reduction for public servants earning annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more, and the parallel reduction in public service pensions over &euro;32,500. The legislation or the public service as an employer does not distinguish between those employees who are members or not members of unions and changes in terms and conditions are applied on a grade basis.<\/p><p>  Contingency measures that may be deployed to secure the necessary reductions in the public service pay and pensions bill are also included, including provision for a universal freeze on pay increments. The Act also affirms that the person, which may be a line Minister or other public service body, that has the power to determine terms and conditions of employment may exercise that power to reduce non-core rates of pay or to increase hours worked. However, under the legislation, a facility is provided for unions and representative associations to conclude collective agreements with their public service employers. Where a union has signed up to a collective agreement, now called the Haddington Road Agreement, that will avoid the need for those contingency measures to be used. <\/p><p>  It is a matter for public servants and their representative unions and associations to decide if they wish to conclude a collective agreement with their employers. This issue is currently subject to consideration or ballot by those unions and associations. I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, do not intend to comment during that process.  <\/p><p>  With regard to those grades represented by a union who do not conclude a collective agreement under the Act, as well as the increment freeze that will apply directly under the terms of the Act, the relevant decision maker will have to take the necessary measures to meet their targeted paybill savings in 2013 and following years.<\/p><p>Under the Haddington Road Agreement proposals, it is proposed that for those public servants on annual salaries (inclusive of allowances in the nature of pay) above &euro;65,000 to the max of the Principal Higher Grade in the civil service or similar across the public service, the reduction in pay will be restored within a maximum of 18 months of the end of the agreement (July 2016) in two equal phases of 9 months. There are no provisions within the proposals regarding increases in pension rates on a similar basis. However, I have stated that it is my intention as a matter of priority to move towards reducing the burden of the public service pension reduction, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Shared Services","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA04450"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[29663\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000062#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the timetable for the implementation of the PeoplePoint shared services initiative; the scope of the project; the processes there will be to prevent disruption to existing service delivery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>In May 2012, a formal decision was taken by the Government to set up a HR and Pensions Administration Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service.

The Board of BGE, together with their advisers, are handling the disposal process, in conjunction with NewERA and the Inter-Departmental Steering Group established to oversee the process on behalf of the Government. The transaction is expected to be concluded before the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  ESB commenced the sale of some of its non-strategic power generation assets, as announced last October, on 28th May.  The sale of the two overseas assets that it announced would be sold &ndash; at Marchwood in the UK and Amorbieta in Spain &ndash; are both expected to be completed in 2013.<\/p><p>  Work is also continuing on planning for the further components of ESB&rsquo;s disposal package, as announced by the company last October.

These matters will continue to be taken into account in the Government&rsquo;s plans for how to proceed with the disposal of its stake in the company.<\/p><p>  At the present moment, however, it is the Government&rsquo;s view that optimal conditions do not exist for a sale of the Government&rsquo;s remaining shareholding just now.

These covered all of the issues that have been raised by various interest groups, including, amongst others, the issue of public access to the forests, replanting obligations to ensure the continued existence of our forests, harvesting policy, the supply of timber to sawmills, as well as the implications for a post-transaction Coillte.<\/p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Steering Group established to oversee the Coillte transaction process, which consists of representatives of NewERA, my department and the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, has considered these reports and appraised myself and the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine of the work completed to-date. <\/p><p>  On foot of this analysis, I can inform the Deputy that the Government has agreed with the joint recommendation of myself and the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine that now is not the appropriate time to proceed with the sale of harvesting rights in Coillte, but instead the focus needs to be on the restructuring of Coillte as a company, to address the issues that were identified in the reviews undertaken.  To that end, I wish to further inform the Deputy that: <\/p><p>  Coillte is to undergo a fundamental restructuring, to be overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, which will include operational streamlining, financial de-leveraging and a critical examination of the disposal options for its non-core activities such as telecoms and wind.<\/p><p>  A robust analysis will also be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na Mona to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>  A priority in this regard will be the annual delivery of a material financial dividend to the State by Coillte.<\/p><p>  And finally, we intend to fill the significant number of vacancies that will arise on the Coillte board this year by persons with relevant experience and commercial expertise to drive the restructuring process and the merger with Bord na Mona if this is approved by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[29563\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the engagement he has had, or overseen, with citizens on the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) 2012 legislation.","asker":"1028","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the model of parliamentary inquiries adopted in the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 fully reflects and respects the views of the electorate on the appropriate scope of Oireachtas inquiries, as evidenced by the outcome of the referendum on the powers of Oireachtas inquiries October 2011.<\/p><p>  The Bill also takes account of the report pre-legislative scrutiny process carried out on the General Scheme of the Bill by the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Properties","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[29669\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way the Office of Public Works can improve Ireland&rsquo;s heritage offering to tourists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>Currently, the Heritage Services Division of the Office of Public Works - which comprises the National Monuments Service and Historic Properties Service units - is responsible for managing the Heritage Estate portfolio which falls within the OPW's remit.   In total, this represents in excess of approx 800 separate properties, a significant number of which are managed by the Office and presented to the public as sites of general visitor interest, whether arising from their singular scenic, historic, archaeological architectural, geological or other qualities.<\/p><p>  A relatively small number of heritage sites (70 no.) are presented by the OPW with full Visitor and Guide facilities.   The attendance at these sites in 2012 was approx 3.8 million visitors and the visitor income derived was in excess of &euro;7m.   This is clearly a very substantial undertaking which is happening in virtually all parts of the State and, though only approx one third of these sites are open on a year round basis, it can clearly be seen that the extent to which the State's tourism offering is underpinned by these attractions is already quite significant.<\/p><p>  Some of these attractions are among the most iconic of Ireland's historic places and are reknowned both nationally and internationally as premier visitor destinations.   Sites such as Dun Aonghusa on the Aran Islands, Kilkenny Castle, Kilmainham Gaol and many others attract significant numbers of visitors and are well known as premier places to visit.   Two heritage sites, Newgrange and Skellig Michael, possess World Heritage Site status from UNESCO and are particularly prized by visitors.   Other locations within the portfolio are however less well known and do not attract a similar volume of numbers.   In many of these cases, the sites in question have many undeniably fine qualities which I feel would make them ideal candidates for development and greater exposure to an increasing number of visitors.<\/p><p>  It is clear that Ireland's heritage plays a significant role in relation to both foreign and domestic tourism.

OPW has also commissioned works in a wide variety of media - painting, sculpture, music and poetry through the Scheme.<\/p><p>  Since the early 1990s, OPW has organised a touring exhibition of artworks to bring the works in the State Art Collection to audiences throughout the country. These exhibitions, which in more recent times, have been organised in partnership with the Department of Finance and Personnel of Northern Ireland as a cross-border cultural project, have travelled to a wide variety of venues including arts centres, libraries, public galleries and visitor centres. The exhibitions are accompanied by illustrated catalogues that document the work of the included artists, serving as records of the events and providing information for researchers.<\/p><p>  The OPW has taken a strategic approach to managing the Scheme in recent years to ensure that the State Art Collection continues to enrich visitors' experiences in public buildings and to raise awareness of current contemporary art practice. Per Cent for Art funding is pooled to ensure the acquisition and commissioning of a variety of art projects to support the creativity of the current generation of artists and the infrastructure that surrounds their practice (galleries, foundries, framers, conservators, artist-led studios, etc).<\/p><p>  The OPW Art Management Handbook sets out the procedures and policies involved in the implementation of the Per Cent for Art Scheme within OPW managed properties. The OPW website contains information in relation to the implementation of the Per Cent for Art Scheme and the management of the State Art Collection. OPW also continues to publish illustrated catalogues documenting the collection and copies of these catalogues are available from the OPW Art Management Office. The Office further encourages access to information for research purposes and works from the State Art Collection are regularly placed on loan to exhibitions organised by other cultural institutions and artists to further facilitate public engagement with the Collection. <\/p><p>  Since its foundation in the mid 19th century, OPW has had responsibility for the presentation of State properties to millions of visitors from home and abroad. OPW continues to incorporate Irish art, craft and design into these properties to promote and encourage the creative output of artists, designers and craftspeople living and working in Ireland. The work created today, facilitated by the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme, forms the heritage of the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":88,"content":"<p>Question No. 39 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[29621\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000063#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider enhancing the resources he has allocated to his Department's eGovernance function with the specific remit of developing the State's capacity to deliver a whole range of services online and at a single portal; the present budget and staff that the eGovernance Unit is allocated; if he will provide figures outlining the potential saving to the State of enhancing online governance capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>The appointment of Government Chief Information Officer, Mr Bill McCluggage, is the first key action in enhancing the resources available to assist the successful implementation of the eGovernment Strategy.

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made on several of the actions for procurement reform contained in the Public Service Reform Plan. The Government agreed on 12 June, 2012 to implement mandatory arrangements in respect of the centralised purchasing frameworks organised by the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP). These national arrangements have benefits that include:<\/p><p> - cash savings;<\/p><p> - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering;<\/p><p> - greater purchasing expertise;<\/p><p> - improved consistency; and,<\/p><p> - enhanced service levels.<\/p><p>  While the key purpose of these reforms to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  In addition, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in September, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.<\/p><p>  In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report of the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The priority areas for the CPO include:<\/p><p> - integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;<\/p><p> - strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p> - much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;<\/p><p> - examining the specifications set out for goods and services;<\/p><p> - evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and<\/p><p> - strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  Since the appointment of the CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops \/ meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.<\/p><p>The Government agreed on 23 April 2013 a plan to reform procurement across the public service. This is one of the elements of the Public Service Reform Programme, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The plan sets out ambitious targets and timelines for changes to the structure and operation of procurement and will deliver much needed savings for the Exchequer. A new organisation called the Office of Government Procurement will be formed and headed by the Government&rsquo;s recently appointed Chief Procurement Officer. The new office will be responsible for procurement policy and operations, working across the public service in delivering better value for the taxpayer. The Government has agreed an ambitious target of &euro;500m of savings to be achieved over 3 years through the transformation of public service procurement.<\/p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend. To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with industry representative associations, employees and workers' representatives as the new Office of Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[29561\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will recall his circular of July 2012 and if he will issue a new circular to all public service procurers informing them that the use of the framework agreements is simply optional and not mandatory.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[29559\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the action he intends to take following the recent High Court judgment which concluded that his Department's Circular 06\/12 is ultra vires as incompatible with EU law as it makes the use of the Managed Print Services Framework Agreements mandatory.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 49 together.<\/p><p>  As both of these questions relate to the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 06\/12 I propose answering them together.<\/p><p>  At the end of May the High Court gave its judgment on certain preliminary issues in relation to the case to which the Deputy refers.

These recommendations were, at the time, the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required and it was important that the relevant Oireachtas Committees could begin the process of examining the Vote allocations for 2013.<\/p><p>  While the recommendations set out in Haddington Road Agreement have changed since the previous LRC recommendations, the pay allocations for individual Votes based on the implementation of these recommendations remain largely the same.<\/p><p>  With regard to the economic impacts of the pay and pension savings, there are no easy options for Government in ensuring that Ireland's deficit targets are met.  However, by adhering to the medium-term fiscal plan and continuing to meet our fiscal targets we can generate positive confidence effects.  These in turn can have a favourable impact on economic performance.<i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Data","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[29684\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the percentage of public sector pensioners currently receiving a pension of &euro;5,000 or less per annum; the percentage of public sector pensioners currently receiving a pension of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;11,000 per annum; the percentage of public sector pensioners currently receiving a pension of between &euro;11,000 and &euro;20,000 per annum; the percentage of public sector pensioners currently receiving a pension of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000 per annum; and the percentage of public sector pensioners receiving a pension of more than &euro;40,000 per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>The data provided applies to retired Civil Servants only.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:<\/p><p> - cash savings;<\/p><p> - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering;<\/p><p> - greater purchasing expertise;<\/p><p> - improved consistency; and,<\/p><p> - enhanced service levels. <\/p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06\/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  Where a mandatory framework arrangement exists, any public service body intending to make a purchase other than through the framework arrangement will need to ensure that it can explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs including those incurred in managing its own procurement process.<\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend.  To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with industry representative associations, employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office of Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 13.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 22.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Properties","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[29680\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the profit from the gift shop sales at the State&rsquo;s tourist and historical sites run by the Office of Public Works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>I have answered a series of questions (Nos. 26589 &ndash; 26592 on 30thMay 2013) which contain a substantial amount of information in relation to the operation of Gift \/ Book shops at sites managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and which may be of assistance to the Deputy.   As indicated at that time, there are two types of retail operation at heritage visitor sites managed by the OPW; the first is where a small amount of material is sold directly by the sites themselves; the second is where a franchise operation manages the retail operation separate from the OPW.<\/p><p>  The majority of the 70 attended visitor sites managed by the OPW do not operate a separate retail outlet for gift merchandise but sell limited visitor material on an across the counter basis.  As this operation is managed by site Guide staff as part of their normal range of duties, it is not therefore feasible to derive accurate figures in relation to the cost base for the retail activity (as opposed to all of the separate guiding and related duties), and information relating to the profit generated by such activity is not available.   In the main, the kind of merchandise sold is low volume and focusses, for the most part, on postcards and publications related to the site or other historical sites nearby.<\/p><p>  Two visitor sites, namely Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne (Newgrange) Visitor Centre in Co. Meath and Dublin Castle have designated retail outlets which operate on a franchise basis.  The type of merchadise sold at these locations is much more varied and would encompass what might be termed more general visitor memorabilia rather than the historic publications material found at the majority of OPW manned sites.<\/p><p>  In the case of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre, the franchise operation was introduced in June 2012 with a fee of &euro;20,000 per annum payable. The fees for 2010, 2011 and 2012 in respect of Dublin Castle Gift Shop amounted to &euro;19,046.16. <\/p><p>  In general, the majority of OPW visitor sites have limited space and facilities to operate a retail outlet.   The primary focus at OPW sites is on the preservation and presentation of the sites in question and the commercial activity referred to is largely secondary.   The scope to develop more substantial retail outlets is therefore to an extent curtailed by both the lack of physical space and the distraction from the core aim.   There are consequently no immediate plans for the development \/ expansion of this area of operations, though additional franchise operations will be considered where space and other consi  derations permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[29730\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding passport applications for children; the length of time they are taking; if applicants\/parents have to make an appointment with the Passport Office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[29731\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding passport applications; the length of time they are taking; if there are exemptions to the time period for emergency passports; the criteria for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together. <\/p><p>  Customers (both adults and children) applying through the Passport Express service are given a commitment by the Passport Service that ten days from the date of receipt by the Passport Service of properly completed applications a passport will be issued.

The Government is acutely aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage and other debt obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  <\/p><p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears.  The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by a special Government Sub-Committee chaired by An Taoiseach, and at official level by a high level Steering Group chaired by my Department's Secretary General or other senior officials.  This Steering Group consists of senior officials from the Departments of the Finance, An Taoiseach, Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Central Bank and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  This Group meets on a fortnightly basis and its purpose is to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of the strategy across Government and to receive and monitor the reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of their respective areas of the overall strategy.<\/p><p>  Following on from the recommendations of the 2011 Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears, the main elements of the mortgage arrears strategy are: <\/p><p><b>  - Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b>  The Personal Insolvency Act, in place since the end of 2012, now provides accessible statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt positions.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which was officially launched in April, will oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks and will very soon be in a position to commence processing insolvency applications.<\/p><p><b>  - Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i>,<\/i> has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which was established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>  - Keeping families in their homes:  <\/b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option is available to households who have unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support.  Provided they meet this and other appropriate criteria, this allows families, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p><b>  - Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b>  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank initiative announced last March, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank is initially requiring the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September and to 50% by the end of December 2013.  The Central Bank will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions.  More recently, the Central Bank also announced a pilot initiative for the restructuring of multiple debt situations to test the viability of a negotiated approach where there is more than one lender involved.  In that overall context, and also in the context of the Central Bank's role in the area of protecting the consumer of financial services, I have also asked my officials to forward the submission from the organisation referred to by Deputy to the Central Bank for its attention and necessary follow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[29745\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline GVA for the most recent five years for which data is available; and the way GVA compares with Northern Ireland and Britain over this time period.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The table below sets out the value of gross value added (GVA) in the economies of Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland and UK less Northern Ireland for the years 2007 to 2011 (the most recent available data).<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Gross Value Added (GVA)<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (Euro Million)<\/td><td>165,443<\/td><td>158,938<\/td><td>145,452<\/td><td>140,970<\/td><td>143,890<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UK<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>1,231,272<\/td><td>1,258,369<\/td><td>1,238,808<\/td><td>1,281,268<\/td><td>1,310,190<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NI<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>28,310<\/td><td>28,607<\/td><td>27,969<\/td><td>29,155<\/td><td>29,870<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UK less NI<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>1,202,962<\/td><td>1,229,762<\/td><td>1,210,839<\/td><td>1,252,113<\/td><td>1,280,320<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Source: CSO, ONS, Dept.

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.<\/p><p>  The function of my Department in relation to fuel prices is confined to taxes imposed on fuel.  In this regard, the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.

The deputy will be aware that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he\/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his\/her centre of main interest (COMI).  The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensure the best possible return for the taxpayer. NAMA advises that it is currently challenging bankruptcy applications on the basis of COMI in two instances and in a further case is supporting the application of another secured bank with a view to having bankruptcy proceedings take place in Ireland.<\/p><p>  As advised in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Agency, as a secured creditor, is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive on-going engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of NAMA debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt. These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.<\/p><p>  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in, for example, the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.<\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that a total of 56 NAMA debtors have been declared bankrupt: 11 in Ireland, 44 in the UK and 1 in the US.  Debtors who have been declared bankrupt outside of Ireland had, by reference to the nominal or par value of loans, exposure to debt of approximately &euro;8 billion at the time of NAMA's acquisition of loans from the participating institutions.

When a debtor goes bankrupt what is generally available is the remaining unencumbered or unsecured assets.  The role of the bankruptcy trustee is, therefore, to realise any other residual unencumbered assets, including properties and cash, which the bankrupt may have and to make a distribution to the creditors including NAMA.

Since I became Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office, I met members of the Irish Educational Publishers Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among its members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given me assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome.  I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15 million to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.  The same level of funding will be provided in 2013.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools on 28 January last.  These guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these guidelines followed a survey of schools by the Department, which I published in May 2012. T his had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I  hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special Guide for Parents was also published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.<\/p><p>  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden they place on already hard-pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level.  I believe these guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I published a report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options is ideal, as each involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes and, if necessary, consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.  Educational book publishers are independent private companies and are not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Issues","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[29903\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way one of the States exam chiefs sat and completed the Leaving Certificate higher level maths paper two but failed to spot the mistake which was made on the paper; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.

The Government must also try to ensure that the available resources are spent carefully and that critical services continue to be delivered.<\/p><p>  I am aware of recent calls for an &#8220;Equality Budgeting&#8221; approach.  Many aspects of the expenditure reforms that I have been progressing - notably with regard to enhanced levels of transparency and the publication of a draft budget, which allows for public consultation and debate on the particulars of the budget before it is finalised - are already responding to this.  <\/p><p>  As you know, the new 'whole-of-year-budgeting' reform, announced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 <\/i>enhances the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas in particular with regard to the role of Committees in <i>ex ante<\/i> consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.  This provides a forum in which Oireachtas Committees and Departments can assess and discuss the equality implications of any policy proposal in advance of the final Estimates.  Furthermore, the Government Programme places emphasis upon performance and delivery across public administration.  Performance Budgeting builds performance information right into the heart of the budget documentation and shows what outputs and outcomes are being delivered with public funds.  This information is now publicly available on the IrelandStat website and links the Government goals with associated outcomes.  <\/p><p>  A recent OECD report (titled &#8220;Crisis squeezes income and puts pressure on inequality and poverty&#8221;), published on 15 May, found that income distribution among Irish households was more equal than the average across the rest of all other OECD nations.  In addition to this, the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2011 illustrates the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes. In 2011, social transfers (including pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 50.7 per cent to 16 per cent.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment that all public bodies would take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. The State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.<\/p><p> Finally, Cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities and these considerations are taken into account when taking Government decisions on Budget matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[29785\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for managing the State&rsquo;s overall portfolio of property assets in order to secure a reduction in the State&rsquo;s property bill in respect of leasehold and rental expenditure; if he will list all properties rented by the State which are subject to an upward only rent review clause; the total annual rental payment in respect of each such property; the date of the next review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>A key priority of the Commissioners of Public Works is to optimise accommodation to facilitate Government Departments in delivering public services efficiently and effectively, and to ensure that property costs are minimised.

The databank contains a comprehensive set of data on public expenditure in Ireland. The capital allocation for 2014, as published in the Revised Book of Estimates, is &euro;3,229 million.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Exchequer capital plan has, by necessity, been reduced in recent years to contribute to fiscal consolidation. However, it is important to note that since the publication of &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; in November 2011 no further cuts have been made to the capital programme. That publication was the result of a major review of capital expenditure. It prioritised investment in infrastructure which would be most beneficial to supporting economic growth, thereby supporting sustainable employment growth in the medium term, meeting urgent social needs and maintaining our existing stock of infrastructure. It also took account of the fact that &euro;70 billion had been invested in the previous decade.<\/p><p>  At the time of publication of the report I noted that, should a funding source become available, there was much more that I wanted to deliver through investment in infrastructure. The deal I negotiated with the Troika with regard to the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the recovery of the PPP market are allowing us to now progress additional projects which we could not include in the 5 year framework.<\/p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a Stimulus Plan of &euro;2.25bn, comprising a &euro;1.4bn PPP programme and an Exchequer element of &euro;850m. The latter is to be funded from some of the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery. On 5th June, as a follow up to last year&rsquo;s Stimulus Plan, I announced Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. This &euro;150m investment is additional to that included in the existing budget. I expect that approximately &euro;70 million of this additional funding will be spent this year, with most of the remainder being spent in 2014 and a small amount in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[29887\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the Office of Public Works taking a castle (details supplied) in County Donegal into State care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>I believe that the process to transfer this castle into State care reached an advanced stage in 2005.

This method by which this is regulated is set out in the Funding Standard.<\/p><p>  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise. It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested. When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>  Trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required to submit an Actuarial Funding Certificate (AFC) to the Pensions Board at regular intervals to indicate whether or not the scheme has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities.  If an AFC indicates that, in the actuary&rsquo;s opinion, the scheme does not satisfy the Funding Standard on the relevant date, the trustees must submit a Funding Proposal to the Pensions Board outlining how it is proposed to restore scheme funding levels.<\/p><p>  The funding proposal must set out a contribution plan which the actuary can certify as being such that s\/he can reasonably expect its implementation to be sufficient to allow the scheme to satisfy the Standard within the period of the proposal.<\/p><p>  Section 52 of the 1990 Pensions Act provides that, by way of Regulation, certain defined benefit pension schemes may be exempt from the requirement to comply with the Funding Standard on the basis that &ldquo;some or all of the benefits under specified schemes or categories of schemes are, or may be, paid in whole or in part out of moneys provided from the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. <\/p><p>  EU Directive 2003\/41\/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (the IORPS Directive) is also relevant in this context. It provides that a Member State may choose to exempt a funded defined benefit pension scheme from the application of a national funding standard only if the scheme is &ldquo;made under statute, pursuant to legislation, and is guaranteed by a public authority&rdquo;.  Essentially, in order to exclude a scheme from the requirements of the Funding Standard, the payment of scheme benefits must be guaranteed by the State. <\/p><p>  The State does not guarantee or accept any liability for the funded schemes of the commercial State companies. In this regard, a case has been made by the ESB Pensions Governance Forum seeking exclusion from the requirements of the Funding Standard. This case is being examined at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":336,"content":"<p>Question No. 127 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[29755\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure that a review is undertaken in respect of a decision to refuse carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer's allowance from the person in question on the 4<sup>th<\/sup> December 2012.

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. <\/p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. <\/p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.<\/p><p>  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum. <\/p><p>  At end 2012, 19.5% approximately of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.<\/p><p>  In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i><\/i>  2013 1,763 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid, with 238 MW of hydro power and 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (mainly landfill gas and biomass).<\/p><p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year.  It was for this reason that I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.<\/p><p>  In order to take a structured approach to connecting the necessary amounts of renewable generation to the grid, the Commission for Energy Regulation established the Gate 3 process.  Under this process, grid connection offers have been made to around 3,900 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. It is now a matter for project developers to accept or reject these offers in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mining Licences","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[29727\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will itemise the numbers of active prospecting licences currently issued broken down by the specified mineral in each case; the location, licensee, duration, and land geographical area applicable.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[29732\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will itemise the numbers of active State mining leases and State mining licences which are currently issued, broken down by the specified mineral in each case; the location, licensee, duration of licence, and geographical area applicable; if he will list the specific mandatory environmental considerations which must be adhered to for the extraction of each type of mineral; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos, 152 and 153 together. <\/p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to the six-monthly report to the Oireachtas by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, compiled under the relevant provisions of the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.

In addition, the guidelines provided a model Memorandum and Articles of Association, along with a model of Corporate Governance Policy which was adaptable to meet individual requirements. <\/p><p>  In June 2012, my Department requested that Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Lucan, Newcastle (CPLN) Local Development Company, Dodder Valley Local Development Company and South Dublin County Council develop a plan to establish a single structure for LCDP delivery in the two areas in question.\u00a0  The new structure, called South Dublin County Partnership Company Ltd was established in 2012. CPLN is therefore no longer contracted to deliver the LCDP on behalf of my Department.  In relation to the particular query raised in the Question, my Department is not aware of any such issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comhairle na Tuaithe","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[29911\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the establishment of an Access to the Countryside Advisory Council and the appointment or designation of county council officials as access officers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) was established in 2004 with a primary focus on the priority areas of: <\/p><p>- access to the countryside,<\/p><p>- developing a countryside code and <\/p><p>- developing a countryside recreation strategy. <\/p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside. From this the National Countryside Recreation Strategy was published in 2006 and &ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo; has recently been established as the prevailing code for recreational users of the countryside. <\/p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe has provided a valuable forum bringing key stakeholders together building trust and co-operation. Access to the countryside for recreational users has proven to be an on-going problem for private landowners, state landholders, recreational users and tourists alike but issues have been significantly progressed through the efforts of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the introduction of the Walks Scheme. While the organisations represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe have individual views on many of the issues to be progressed, the National Countryside Recreation Strategy reflects the consensus view of its members. <\/p><p>Meetings are chaired by my Department. The group meets regularly to discuss and progress matters relating to rural recreation and activity tourism. My Department also sit on the National Trails Advisory Committee which oversees best practice in relation to trail planning and development.   <\/p><p>  Through Service Level Agreements between my Department and Local Development Companies, Rural Recreational Officers are employed to raise awareness of the walking and activity\/recreation product, and to facilitate tourism and marketing initiatives, and they have negotiated and managed Walks Scheme maintenance contracts with over 1800 landowners, all on a permissive access basis. Work has recently commenced on renewing these maintenance contracts for a further five year period. The Rural Recreation Officers now represent a unique resource locally for providing best practice in trail maintenance, management, marketing and the development of a broad range of rural recreation and activity tourism products. <\/p><p>In light of the committees already in place and the very significant level of progress made through Comhairle na Tuaithe I feel that the establishment of an Access to the Countryside Advisory Council and the appointment or designation of county council officials as access officers is not warranted. There are approximately 620 trails throughout the country listed on the Irish trails website which are all based on permissive access.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRQ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Dogs","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRQ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[29700\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to amend or rescind the Control of Dogs (Restriction of Certain Dogs) Regulations 1991; if so, when it is likely to happen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>The regulations referred to in the Question were revoked and replaced by the Control of Dogs Regulations, 1998 .

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

This permission appears to have been renewed on a regular basis by her local Immigration Officer until March 2010.  I am informed that when she attended the registration office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in May 2010, she was advised to contact my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) regarding same.  However it appears that the next contact from the person concerned was in March 2012 when she presented to her local Immigration Officer.  She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.  The local Immigration Officer advised her to write to INIS outlining her situation prior to renewal of registration. I am informed that she was given this direction by him on 26th August 2012. <br \/><br \/>  I understand that some documentation has since been received from the person concerned by INIS.  However, in order to assist in regularising her status in the State, further documentation was requested from her in writing on 13th March 2013.  To date no response has been received.  On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS.  Once a decision has been made on her status, this decision and the consequences involved will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  I am also informed that the person concerned submitted an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation in August 2005.  This application was refused by my predecessor at his absolute discretion.  The person's legal representative was notified of the decision and the reason for same by letter dated 31st March 2009.  She may re-apply at any time when in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements.<\/blockquote>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must -<\/p><p>- be of full age;<\/p><p>- be of good character;<\/p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;<\/p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and<\/p><p>- have, <font color=\"#212100\">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows-<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.<\/font><\/p><p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.  Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<\/p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  <\/p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.  Upon receipt of such a request, the position in the State of the person concerned will be further considered.<\/p><p>  I am advised that there is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been submitted by the person concerned. <\/p><p>  In relation to the spouse of the person concerned, the position is that his permission to remain was renewed on 29 February, 2012 for a further three years, valid to 20<sup><\/sup>  February, 2015. However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:<\/p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,<\/p><p>(ii) their Passport and<\/p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.<\/p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  <\/p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110\/13 and 28708\/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.<\/p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug.

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;<\/p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   <\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[29867\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement to have achieved a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare on their holding in 2011 and who applied for and initially were refused derogation in this regard. <\/p><p>  However, following further recent contact and clarification, the holding concerned has been confirmed as satisfying this requirement.

I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Registration of all child-care providers.<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new<\/i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current<\/i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  <\/p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. <\/p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[29765\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000064#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has studied the submission of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare regarding the provisions of the early childhood care and education scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am aware that the issue of additional supports for children who are accessing preschool services has been raised with my Department. <\/p><p>  While additional flexibility is provided in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to enable children with special needs to avail of the free preschool provision, there is no further resources available to my Department to provide additional supports for children who need specialist support in the preschool setting.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.<\/p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013<\/i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.

Office of Public Works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>I have answered a series of questions (Nos. 26589 &ndash; 26592 on 30thMay 2013) which contain a substantial amount of information in relation to the operation of Gift \/ Book shops at sites managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and which may be of assistance to the Deputy.   As indicated at that time, there are two types of retail operation at heritage visitor sites managed by the OPW; the first is where a small amount of material is sold directly by the sites themselves; the second is where a franchise operation manages the retail operation separate from the OPW.<\/p><p>  The majority of the 70 attended visitor sites managed by the OPW do not operate a separate retail outlet for gift merchandise but sell limited visitor material on an across the counter basis.  As this operation is managed by site Guide staff as part of their normal range of duties, it is not therefore feasible to derive accurate figures in relation to the cost base for the retail activity (as opposed to all of the separate guiding and related duties), and information relating to the profit generated by such activity is not available.   In the main, the kind of merchandise sold is low volume and focusses, for the most part, on postcards and publications related to the site or other historical sites nearby.<\/p><p>  Two visitor sites, namely Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne (Newgrange) Visitor Centre in Co. Meath and Dublin Castle have designated retail outlets which operate on a franchise basis.  The type of merchadise sold at these locations is much more varied and would encompass what might be termed more general visitor memorabilia rather than the historic publications material found at the majority of OPW manned sites.<\/p><p>  In the case of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre, the franchise operation was introduced in June 2012 with a fee of &euro;20,000 per annum payable. The fees for 2010, 2011 and 2012 in respect of Dublin Castle Gift Shop amounted to &euro;19,046.16. <\/p><p>  In general, the majority of OPW visitor sites have limited space and facilities to operate a retail outlet.   The primary focus at OPW sites is on the preservation and presentation of the sites in question and the commercial activity referred to is largely secondary.   The scope to develop more substantial retail outlets is therefore to an extent curtailed by both the lack of physical space and the distraction from the core aim.   There are consequently no immediate plans for the development \/ expansion of this area of operations, though additional franchise operations will be considered where space and other consi  derations permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[29730\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding passport applications for children; the length of time they are taking; if applicants\/parents have to make an appointment with the Passport Office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[29731\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding passport applications; the length of time they are taking; if there are exemptions to the time period for emergency passports; the criteria for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together. <\/p><p>  Customers (both adults and children) applying through the Passport Express service are given a commitment by the Passport Service that ten days from the date of receipt by the Passport Service of properly completed applications a passport will be issued.

The Government is acutely aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage and other debt obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  <\/p><p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears.  The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by a special Government Sub-Committee chaired by An Taoiseach, and at official level by a high level Steering Group chaired by my Department's Secretary General or other senior officials.  This Steering Group consists of senior officials from the Departments of the Finance, An Taoiseach, Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Central Bank and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  This Group meets on a fortnightly basis and its purpose is to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of the strategy across Government and to receive and monitor the reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of their respective areas of the overall strategy.<\/p><p>  Following on from the recommendations of the 2011 Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears, the main elements of the mortgage arrears strategy are: <\/p><p><b>  - Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b>  The Personal Insolvency Act, in place since the end of 2012, now provides accessible statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt positions.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which was officially launched in April, will oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks and will very soon be in a position to commence processing insolvency applications.<\/p><p><b>  - Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i>,<\/i> has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which was established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>  - Keeping families in their homes:  <\/b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option is available to households who have unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support.  Provided they meet this and other appropriate criteria, this allows families, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p><b>  - Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b>  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank initiative announced last March, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank is initially requiring the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September and to 50% by the end of December 2013.  The Central Bank will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions.  More recently, the Central Bank also announced a pilot initiative for the restructuring of multiple debt situations to test the viability of a negotiated approach where there is more than one lender involved.  In that overall context, and also in the context of the Central Bank's role in the area of protecting the consumer of financial services, I have also asked my officials to forward the submission from the organisation referred to by Deputy to the Central Bank for its attention and necessary follow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000065#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":790,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000066#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[29745\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000066#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline GVA for the most recent five years for which data is available; and the way GVA compares with Northern Ireland and Britain over this time period.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":792,"content":"<p>The table below sets out the value of gross value added (GVA) in the economies of Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland and UK less Northern Ireland for the years 2007 to 2011 (the most recent available data).<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Gross Value Added (GVA)<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (Euro Million)<\/td><td>165,443<\/td><td>158,938<\/td><td>145,452<\/td><td>140,970<\/td><td>143,890<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UK<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>1,231,272<\/td><td>1,258,369<\/td><td>1,238,808<\/td><td>1,281,268<\/td><td>1,310,190<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NI<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>28,310<\/td><td>28,607<\/td><td>27,969<\/td><td>29,155<\/td><td>29,870<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UK less NI<\/td><td>GVA at Current Basic Prices (GBP Million)<\/td><td>1,202,962<\/td><td>1,229,762<\/td><td>1,210,839<\/td><td>1,252,113<\/td><td>1,280,320<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Source: CSO, ONS, Dept.

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.<\/p><p>  The function of my Department in relation to fuel prices is confined to taxes imposed on fuel.  In this regard, the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.

The deputy will be aware that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he\/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his\/her centre of main interest (COMI).  The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensure the best possible return for the taxpayer. NAMA advises that it is currently challenging bankruptcy applications on the basis of COMI in two instances and in a further case is supporting the application of another secured bank with a view to having bankruptcy proceedings take place in Ireland.<\/p><p>  As advised in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Agency, as a secured creditor, is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive on-going engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of NAMA debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt. These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.<\/p><p>  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in, for example, the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.<\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that a total of 56 NAMA debtors have been declared bankrupt: 11 in Ireland, 44 in the UK and 1 in the US.  Debtors who have been declared bankrupt outside of Ireland had, by reference to the nominal or par value of loans, exposure to debt of approximately &euro;8 billion at the time of NAMA's acquisition of loans from the participating institutions.

When a debtor goes bankrupt what is generally available is the remaining unencumbered or unsecured assets.  The role of the bankruptcy trustee is, therefore, to realise any other residual unencumbered assets, including properties and cash, which the bankrupt may have and to make a distribution to the creditors including NAMA.

Since I became Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office, I met members of the Irish Educational Publishers Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among its members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given me assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome.  I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15 million to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.  The same level of funding will be provided in 2013.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools on 28 January last.  These guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these guidelines followed a survey of schools by the Department, which I published in May 2012. T his had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I  hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special Guide for Parents was also published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.<\/p><p>  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden they place on already hard-pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level.  I believe these guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I published a report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options is ideal, as each involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes and, if necessary, consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.  Educational book publishers are independent private companies and are not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000070#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Issues","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000070#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[29903\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000070#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way one of the States exam chiefs sat and completed the Leaving Certificate higher level maths paper two but failed to spot the mistake which was made on the paper; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.

The Government must also try to ensure that the available resources are spent carefully and that critical services continue to be delivered.<\/p><p>  I am aware of recent calls for an &#8220;Equality Budgeting&#8221; approach.  Many aspects of the expenditure reforms that I have been progressing - notably with regard to enhanced levels of transparency and the publication of a draft budget, which allows for public consultation and debate on the particulars of the budget before it is finalised - are already responding to this.  <\/p><p>  As you know, the new 'whole-of-year-budgeting' reform, announced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 <\/i>enhances the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas in particular with regard to the role of Committees in <i>ex ante<\/i> consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.  This provides a forum in which Oireachtas Committees and Departments can assess and discuss the equality implications of any policy proposal in advance of the final Estimates.  Furthermore, the Government Programme places emphasis upon performance and delivery across public administration.  Performance Budgeting builds performance information right into the heart of the budget documentation and shows what outputs and outcomes are being delivered with public funds.  This information is now publicly available on the IrelandStat website and links the Government goals with associated outcomes.  <\/p><p>  A recent OECD report (titled &#8220;Crisis squeezes income and puts pressure on inequality and poverty&#8221;), published on 15 May, found that income distribution among Irish households was more equal than the average across the rest of all other OECD nations.  In addition to this, the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2011 illustrates the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes. In 2011, social transfers (including pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 50.7 per cent to 16 per cent.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment that all public bodies would take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. The State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.<\/p><p> Finally, Cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities and these considerations are taken into account when taking Government decisions on Budget matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000071#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000072#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[29785\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000072#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for managing the State&rsquo;s overall portfolio of property assets in order to secure a reduction in the State&rsquo;s property bill in respect of leasehold and rental expenditure; if he will list all properties rented by the State which are subject to an upward only rent review clause; the total annual rental payment in respect of each such property; the date of the next review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>A key priority of the Commissioners of Public Works is to optimise accommodation to facilitate Government Departments in delivering public services efficiently and effectively, and to ensure that property costs are minimised.

The databank contains a comprehensive set of data on public expenditure in Ireland. The capital allocation for 2014, as published in the Revised Book of Estimates, is &euro;3,229 million.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Exchequer capital plan has, by necessity, been reduced in recent years to contribute to fiscal consolidation. However, it is important to note that since the publication of &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; in November 2011 no further cuts have been made to the capital programme. That publication was the result of a major review of capital expenditure. It prioritised investment in infrastructure which would be most beneficial to supporting economic growth, thereby supporting sustainable employment growth in the medium term, meeting urgent social needs and maintaining our existing stock of infrastructure. It also took account of the fact that &euro;70 billion had been invested in the previous decade.<\/p><p>  At the time of publication of the report I noted that, should a funding source become available, there was much more that I wanted to deliver through investment in infrastructure. The deal I negotiated with the Troika with regard to the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the recovery of the PPP market are allowing us to now progress additional projects which we could not include in the 5 year framework.<\/p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a Stimulus Plan of &euro;2.25bn, comprising a &euro;1.4bn PPP programme and an Exchequer element of &euro;850m. The latter is to be funded from some of the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery. On 5th June, as a follow up to last year&rsquo;s Stimulus Plan, I announced Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. This &euro;150m investment is additional to that included in the existing budget. I expect that approximately &euro;70 million of this additional funding will be spent this year, with most of the remainder being spent in 2014 and a small amount in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000072#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":944,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000072#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":945,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[29887\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000072#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the Office of Public Works taking a castle (details supplied) in County Donegal into State care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":946,"content":"<p>I believe that the process to transfer this castle into State care reached an advanced stage in 2005.

This method by which this is regulated is set out in the Funding Standard.<\/p><p>  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise. It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested. When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>  Trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required to submit an Actuarial Funding Certificate (AFC) to the Pensions Board at regular intervals to indicate whether or not the scheme has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities.  If an AFC indicates that, in the actuary&rsquo;s opinion, the scheme does not satisfy the Funding Standard on the relevant date, the trustees must submit a Funding Proposal to the Pensions Board outlining how it is proposed to restore scheme funding levels.<\/p><p>  The funding proposal must set out a contribution plan which the actuary can certify as being such that s\/he can reasonably expect its implementation to be sufficient to allow the scheme to satisfy the Standard within the period of the proposal.<\/p><p>  Section 52 of the 1990 Pensions Act provides that, by way of Regulation, certain defined benefit pension schemes may be exempt from the requirement to comply with the Funding Standard on the basis that &ldquo;some or all of the benefits under specified schemes or categories of schemes are, or may be, paid in whole or in part out of moneys provided from the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. <\/p><p>  EU Directive 2003\/41\/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (the IORPS Directive) is also relevant in this context. It provides that a Member State may choose to exempt a funded defined benefit pension scheme from the application of a national funding standard only if the scheme is &ldquo;made under statute, pursuant to legislation, and is guaranteed by a public authority&rdquo;.  Essentially, in order to exclude a scheme from the requirements of the Funding Standard, the payment of scheme benefits must be guaranteed by the State. <\/p><p>  The State does not guarantee or accept any liability for the funded schemes of the commercial State companies. In this regard, a case has been made by the ESB Pensions Governance Forum seeking exclusion from the requirements of the Funding Standard. This case is being examined at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000073#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":975,"content":"<p>Question No. 127 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000074#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[29755\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000074#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure that a review is undertaken in respect of a decision to refuse carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer's allowance from the person in question on the 4<sup>th<\/sup> December 2012.

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. <\/p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. <\/p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.<\/p><p>  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum. <\/p><p>  At end 2012, 19.5% approximately of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.<\/p><p>  In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i><\/i>  2013 1,763 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid, with 238 MW of hydro power and 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (mainly landfill gas and biomass).<\/p><p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year.  It was for this reason that I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.<\/p><p>  In order to take a structured approach to connecting the necessary amounts of renewable generation to the grid, the Commission for Energy Regulation established the Gate 3 process.  Under this process, grid connection offers have been made to around 3,900 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. It is now a matter for project developers to accept or reject these offers in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000076#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mining Licences","counter":1044,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000076#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1045,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[29727\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000076#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will itemise the numbers of active prospecting licences currently issued broken down by the specified mineral in each case; the location, licensee, duration, and land geographical area applicable.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[29732\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000076#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will itemise the numbers of active State mining leases and State mining licences which are currently issued, broken down by the specified mineral in each case; the location, licensee, duration of licence, and geographical area applicable; if he will list the specific mandatory environmental considerations which must be adhered to for the extraction of each type of mineral; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos, 152 and 153 together. <\/p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to the six-monthly report to the Oireachtas by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, compiled under the relevant provisions of the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.

From this the National Countryside Recreation Strategy was published in 2006 and &ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo; has recently been established as the prevailing code for recreational users of the countryside. <\/p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe has provided a valuable forum bringing key stakeholders together building trust and co-operation. Access to the countryside for recreational users has proven to be an on-going problem for private landowners, state landholders, recreational users and tourists alike but issues have been significantly progressed through the efforts of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the introduction of the Walks Scheme. While the organisations represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe have individual views on many of the issues to be progressed, the National Countryside Recreation Strategy reflects the consensus view of its members. <\/p><p>Meetings are chaired by my Department.

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

This permission appears to have been renewed on a regular basis by her local Immigration Officer until March 2010.  I am informed that when she attended the registration office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in May 2010, she was advised to contact my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) regarding same.  However it appears that the next contact from the person concerned was in March 2012 when she presented to her local Immigration Officer.  She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.  The local Immigration Officer advised her to write to INIS outlining her situation prior to renewal of registration. I am informed that she was given this direction by him on 26th August 2012. <br \/><br \/>  I understand that some documentation has since been received from the person concerned by INIS.  However, in order to assist in regularising her status in the State, further documentation was requested from her in writing on 13th March 2013.  To date no response has been received.  On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS.  Once a decision has been made on her status, this decision and the consequences involved will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  I am also informed that the person concerned submitted an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation in August 2005.  This application was refused by my predecessor at his absolute discretion.  The person's legal representative was notified of the decision and the reason for same by letter dated 31st March 2009.  She may re-apply at any time when in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements.<\/blockquote>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must -<\/p><p>- be of full age;<\/p><p>- be of good character;<\/p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;<\/p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and<\/p><p>- have, <font color=\"#212100\">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows-<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.<\/font><\/p><p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.  Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<\/p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  <\/p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.

However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:<\/p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,<\/p><p>(ii) their Passport and<\/p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.<\/p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  <\/p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110\/13 and 28708\/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.<\/p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug.

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;<\/p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   <\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[29867\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1219,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement to have achieved a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare on their holding in 2011 and who applied for and initially were refused derogation in this regard. <\/p><p>  However, following further recent contact and clarification, the holding concerned has been confirmed as satisfying this requirement.

I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Registration of all child-care providers.<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new<\/i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current<\/i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  <\/p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. <\/p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":1243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1244,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[29765\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000078#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has studied the submission of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare regarding the provisions of the early childhood care and education scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1245,"content":"<p>I am aware that the issue of additional supports for children who are accessing preschool services has been raised with my Department. <\/p><p>  While additional flexibility is provided in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to enable children with special needs to avail of the free preschool provision, there is no further resources available to my Department to provide additional supports for children who need specialist support in the preschool setting.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.<\/p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013<\/i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  <\/p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.  Upon receipt of such a request, the position in the State of the person concerned will be further considered.<\/p><p>  I am advised that there is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been submitted by the person concerned. <\/p><p>  In relation to the spouse of the person concerned, the position is that his permission to remain was renewed on 29 February, 2012 for a further three years, valid to 20<sup><\/sup>  February, 2015. However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:<\/p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,<\/p><p>(ii) their Passport and<\/p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.<\/p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. <\/p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  <\/p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.  Where such verifiable documentary evidence is produced, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has the discretionary powers to effect registration without the production of a valid passport, however, this discretion will only be exercised in the most limited of circumstances.<\/p><p>  It will be open to the person concerned, and her spouse, to apply to the Citizenship Division of my Department for Certificates of Naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to the lodgment of such applications.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110\/13 and 28708\/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.<\/p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug. The 28 day limit was removed in September 2012.  There is, however, limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone being used for longer periods and the position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps. <\/p><p>  Over the years concerns have been raised concerning the use of Lariam. I have had all of these \/concerns investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the anti- malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of Lariam has worked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1485,"content":"<p>Question No. 205 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Data","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[30452\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of persons employed within the public sector by his Department or agency and by grade for each year the five consecutive years for which the most recent data is available.","asker":"1080","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The tables below show the information requested in respect of Civil Servants, Civilian Personnel and the Defence Forces for the years 2008 to 2012.<\/p><p><b>Civil Service Staff of the Department<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><td>Number of Staff<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Grade Title<\/th><th>31.12.2008<\/th><th>31.12.2009<\/th><th>31.12.2010<\/th><th>31.10.2011<\/th><th>31.12.2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Secretary General<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Secretary<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Director<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Principal<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Professional Accountant<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>32<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Administrative Officer<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>75<\/td><td>71<\/td><td>71<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Staff Officer<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Clerical Officer<\/th><th>144<\/th><th>130<\/th><th>122<\/th><th>122<\/th><th>120<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Storeman<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Head Services Officer<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Service Officers<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Service Attendant<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nightwatchman<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Superintendant of Cleaners<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cleaner<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Special Advisor to Minister<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Press Advisor to Minister<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal Assistant to Minister<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal Secretary to Minister<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Civilian Drivers<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Numbers<\/td><td>410<\/td><td>370<\/td><td>351<\/td><td>349<\/td><td>348<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The bodies under the aegis of my Department in the period 2008 to 2012 were the Civil Defence Board, the Army Pensions Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;<\/p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   <\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1503,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[29867\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1504,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement to have achieved a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare on their holding in 2011 and who applied for and initially were refused derogation in this regard. <\/p><p>  However, following further recent contact and clarification, the holding concerned has been confirmed as satisfying this requirement.

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.<\/p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.<\/p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b><\/b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. <\/p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:<\/p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;<\/p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; <\/p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;<\/p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;<\/p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;<\/p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;<\/p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and<\/p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Registration of all child-care providers.<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new<\/i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current<\/i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  <\/p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. <\/p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":1528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1529,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[29765\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has studied the submission of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare regarding the provisions of the early childhood care and education scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1530,"content":"<p>I am aware that the issue of additional supports for children who are accessing preschool services has been raised with my Department. <\/p><p>  While additional flexibility is provided in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to enable children with special needs to avail of the free preschool provision, there is no further resources available to my Department to provide additional supports for children who need specialist support in the preschool setting.

The review concluded that there is strong evidence to support the introduction of standardised\/plain packaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[29718\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if new born babies are covered by free general practitioner care for six weeks after birth; if this service covers care doc after hours services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1560,"content":"<p>The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme is open to all expectant mothers (who are ordinarily resident in Ireland) and care under this scheme may be obtained free of charge from any GP who has a contract for the provision of services under the scheme.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.<\/p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013<\/i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. The terms of reference for this review are as follows; taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation; to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; to examine the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices; having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and to make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme. The review will look at possible alternative models of care. Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013-early 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme Administration","counter":1589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1590,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[29838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000081#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to require pharmaceutical companies to package prescriptions in boxes of 30 or 31 depending on the month of the year to reduce costs for persons who buy monthly medication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1591,"content":"<p>There is no legislation or agreement that deals with the quantity of prescription tablets to be included in a monthly pack.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;<\/p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   <\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000082#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000082#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[29867\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000082#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1700,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement to have achieved a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare on their holding in 2011 and who applied for and initially were refused derogation in this regard. <\/p><p>  However, following further recent contact and clarification, the holding concerned has been confirmed as satisfying this requirement.

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.<\/p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.<\/p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b><\/b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. <\/p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:<\/p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;<\/p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; <\/p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;<\/p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;<\/p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;<\/p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;<\/p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and<\/p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Registration of all child-care providers.<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new<\/i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current<\/i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.<\/p><p><br \/><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.<\/b><\/p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  <\/p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. <\/p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000083#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":1724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000083#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1725,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[29765\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000083#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has studied the submission of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare regarding the provisions of the early childhood care and education scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1726,"content":"<p>I am aware that the issue of additional supports for children who are accessing preschool services has been raised with my Department. <\/p><p>  While additional flexibility is provided in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to enable children with special needs to avail of the free preschool provision, there is no further resources available to my Department to provide additional supports for children who need specialist support in the preschool setting.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.<\/p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013<\/i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.

As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000085#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1801,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[29937\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000085#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when eligibility for a medical card will be reviewed in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1802,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that\u00a0the\u00a0main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards. and to\u00a0progress\u00a0affordable projects\u00a0 such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  While Metro North was being procured as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with a targeted\u00a0 EIB loan of up to &euro;500 million it also required a very significant Exchequer contribution to support the PPP. This Exchequer contribution is not affordable within the funding envelope now available for transport projects to 2016. In addition, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding of the size required for\u00a0 Metro North is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances. The road\u00a0 PPPs currently being progressed require a much smaller private sector involvement\u00a0and do not require any further\u00a0 Exchequer support\u00a0 for construction.\u00a0 Furthermore, securing the closure of these much smaller roads PPPS has proven challenging, with only one, so far, having\u00a0being brought to financial close since 2008.<\/p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation\u00a0Plan for investment to 2018\u00a0 in the GDA as required under the DTA ACT 2008.

At that point we will need a joined-up solution to deal with congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Issues","counter":1877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1878,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[30005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 502 of 25 September 2012, the latest update on the speed limit review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1879,"content":"<p>The Review Group\u00a0has\u00a0made significant progress\u00a0in this complex and highly technical area and I\u00a0expect to receive\u00a0the Final Report from the Group very shortly.    \u00a0<\/p><p>  As I mentioned in Dail Eireann previously,\u00a0 I hope to submit the Report to the Oireachtas Committee on Transpolrt and Communications for their views and\u00a0I will give careful consideration to implementing any recommendations that emerge from that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Data","counter":1880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1881,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[30460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062000088#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons employed within the public sector by his Department or agency and by grade for each year the five consecutive years for which the most recent data is available.","asker":"1080","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1882,"content":"<p>The breakdown of staff numbers as whole-time equivalents (WTE) in\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Transport\u00a0for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010\u00a0together with\u00a0the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport numbers from 2011 to the end of May of 2013\u00a0are set out in the table below.\u00a0  There were substantial staff reductions in 2009 and 2010\u00a0 due primarily to incentivised early retirements, incentivised career break schemes and latterly due to staff redeployment to other Departments.\u00a0\u00a0 The underlying trend of\u00a0substantial reductions\u00a0continued\u00a0to apply in 2011 and 2012.
