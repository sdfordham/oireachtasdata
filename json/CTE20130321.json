Salaries accounted for over 36% of current expenditure, with, at the end of the year, approximately 2,400 whole-time equivalent staff in the Department and its related offices.  The justice Vote includes more than 60 individual subheads.  As well as the administrative costs of the Department, the subheads relate to expenditure on areas such as commissions and special inquiries, legal aid, immigration and asylum, the Probation Service, equality, integration and disability, charities, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Forensic Science Laboratory.  The Vote also includes funding for a range of services including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p><p>  A Supplementary Estimate was passed for Vote 19 in 2011.  As shown in the appropriation account, an additional &euro;10 million was provided for criminal legal aid, on top of the original Estimate of &euro;47.6 million.  The outturn for the year was just over &euro;56 million.  This is on a par with 2010 expenditure.  An additional &euro;5.6 million was also provided in 2011 for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  An additional &euro;1.2 million was provided for commissions and inquiries.  The increases in these subheads were offset by reductions in the Estimate provisions for a range of services, including the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Office of the State Pathologist and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  <\/p><p>  The appropriation account for Vote 13, Office of the Chief State Solicitor, is also before the committee today.  The function of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is to provide legal services to the Attorney General, Departments and offices and State agencies.  In 2011, the office recorded gross expenditure of &euro;32.9 million.  Of this, &euro;14.4 million was spent on salaries and &euro;15.8 million was allocated for the payment of fees to counsel and general law expenses.<\/p><p>  Chapter 15 concerns the circumstances around the lease of a premises for a Probation Service project that gave rise to a situation in which no benefit was received despite a &euro;2 million outlay.  The Department funds 46 community-based organisations across the State to develop and deliver services to adult offenders in their communities. One of these is the Bridge project, which has operated in the Dublin north inner city area for more than 15 years.  The project aims to achieve community reintegration of male offenders, improve their job skills and generally assist in increasing community safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100004#C02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363861200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call on Mr. Purcell to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100005#D00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363861200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose to keep my opening remarks brief in the interests of making the best use of members' time.  My remit as Accounting Officer is very broad.  There are in the region of 60 subheads in the justice Vote, covering a range of offices and agencies across the criminal justice sector, including the areas of immigration, commissions, equality and disability.  I am also the Accounting Officer for the prisons Vote.<\/p><p>  In my role as Accounting Officer, I acknowledge the contribution of the Department's audit committee in ensuring that there is a strong system of internal controls in place.  The committee is comprised of four external members and one departmental representative.  The chair is external and independent of the Department.  The committee is supported by an internal audit unit.  This unit functions through its audit work programme and provides assurance that there are effective financial and other controls in place.  In 2011, 24 audit reports were completed and the corresponding figure in 2012 was 26.  In a Department with as wide a remit as that of the Department of Justice and Equality, which comprises over 60 individual subheads and a large number of offices and agencies, such audit assurance is crucially important to me in my role as Accounting Officer.  In addition, given the range and breadth of offices and agencies under the justice Vote, it is very important to have a strong governance structure in place.  This is not to say that we want to stifle or restrict in any way the functions of any of the offices and agencies a number of which are established on a statutory basis.  However, I firmly believe that strong oversight is important to ensure the highest standards of financial control and that value for money is obtained from the expenditure in the justice and equality Vote.  This is something I have continued to build on since my appointment as Secretary General in August 2011.<\/p><p>  A key feature of the governance structure within the Department is that each office and agency attached to the justice and equality Vote, while operating according to its legislative status and its own business plan and objectives, is accountable to the central Department in terms of budgets and expenditure.  In short, with just a couple of exceptions, all the expenditure in the justice and equality Vote is managed through a central accounting system in the Department's financial services centre in Killarney.  The same rules and regulations apply to procurement and expenditure across the Department, irrespective of the office or agency involved.<\/p><p>  Turning specifically to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the lease of accommodation for a Probation Service project in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin, I have found it very frustrating that a building which was acquired under a 25-year lease and fitted out to the standard required for use by the Probation Service cannot now be used for the purpose intended.  However, I have been advised by the Attorney General's office that this matter remains live and in dispute and that proceedings have now issued in this case.  I have also been advised that notwithstanding the publication of chapter 15 of the Comptroller General's annual report for 2011, it is entirely foreseeable that any further discussion of, or comment on, the facts of this matter as set out in that chapter could, in effect, reveal our hand to the other parties in the proceedings, thereby prejudicing the prospect of the State successfully recovering all the damages it is seeking.  I will, of course, try to answer any questions raised by the committee within these constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1363861200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purcell.

This is my first time to appear before the committee since my appointment as Chief State Solicitor just over a year ago.  As requested, I have forwarded a briefing note which sets out the main developments and challenges facing the office and which includes details of expenditure in 2012 and the current position with the Bridge Project, the subject matter of chapter 15.<\/p><p>  The status of the lease - the subject matter of chapter 15 - remains in dispute between the Department of Justice and Equality, the landlord-receiver and the architect.

Proceedings have now issued in this case and I would draw the committee's attention to section 5 of the same Act.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, in his report of 2011, made a recommendation to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As this recommendation was made in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of the issues outlined in the chapter, I am constrained in any response I can give at this time.  I wish to assure the committee that risk assessment is a matter which is taken with the utmost seriousness by me and my office.  A full response to the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be made at the conclusion of this case.  The outcome of this case will inform that response.<\/p><p>  The committee may be already aware that my office is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and that it provides solicitor services within that office and to Government Departments and offices.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has a wide remit including, but not limited to, civil litigation in all courts - including the European Court of Justice - and the provision of solicitor service in the areas of conveyancing and property law, Government contracts and public procurement issues for an array of Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity and sometimes can involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.  It should be noted that my office does not provide a solicitor service for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the prosecution of offences.<\/p><p>  As set out in more detail in my briefing document, it must be noted that my office must meet a number of challenges.  In summary, it has to balance the need to operate within the constraints of reduced resources and budget while ensuring that the legal service it is providing is of the highest standard as required by Government and is achieving maximum value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100005#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Creedon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363861800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Creedon.

On Ms Creedon's comment on chapter 15, the committee has taken legal advice from the parliamentary legal adviser and our advice is that the matter is properly before the committee and therefore in accordance with Standing Order 163 of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the mandate given to the committee that it is up to us to examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Accounting Officer.  In this case, as outlined in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the committee must examine how the State has entered a lease, paid out &euro;2 million to date and yet has derived no benefit from the expenditure.  Our job is to follow this by way of examination with the Accounting Officer as there is ineffective expenditure of public money.  This is our job and we would be failing in our mandate if we did not thoroughly examine the issue.<\/p><p>  An examination of the issue potentially in a number of years' time is not an option for the committee.  My understanding from reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that the State has tried to get out of the lease and that this has been refused.  There is a potential bill to the State of between &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million.  The likelihood of a court case does not mean that the PAC cannot deal with the issue today.  I refer again to the legal advice given to us by the parliamentary legal adviser.  I also note from Mr. Purcell's opening remarks that he is prepared, within the constraints outlined, to answer as many questions as he can.  Understanding the balance that has to be struck between the position of the office and its dealings with the landlord and the work this committee has to undertake, it is our intention this morning to pursue the matter in public session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100006#E00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363861800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  I would like to say that under no circumstances is it my intention to in any way be unhelpful to the committee or to obstruct its work.  I am fully cognisant of the function, importance and duty of the committee to examine matters of this kind.  I am also fully cognisant of the right of the committee and the taxpayer to examine issues where taxpayers' money may be seen to be at a loss or misspent in any way.  I fully appreciate that.<\/p><p>  As the committee members might be aware, litigation has issued in this case and as Chief State Solicitor I am responsible for the carriage of the case.  In keeping my focus on value for the taxpayer and recovering in this case, my primary focus is the safe carriage of the proceedings through the courts.  I am conscious that if I discuss the matter in public or otherwise and prejudice those proceedings, I am therefore prejudicing the likelihood of making a recovery for the taxpayer in this case.  That is the purpose and function of the provisions in the 1997 Act to which I have referred.  It is a long established principle that officers of the Attorney General's office, of which I am one, confine their comments to matters touching on the administration of the office for that reason.  I fully accept that the recommendation made by the Comptroller and Auditor General to me in terms of risk management touches on the administration of the office.  I fully accept that I need to take on board those recommendations and fully respond to them.  I have no difficulty at all with that.

Would you, Chairman, consider it appropriate for us to deal with the general Vote issues and then go into private session to deal with the issues relating to chapter 15?  That could facilitate a better discussion.  As the Chief State Solicitor has outlined, there would be difficulties.  As I said in the opening statement, it would certainly be foreseeable that a discussion on the matter might reveal our hand in a way that could prejudice the State's ability to successfully prosecute the case.  I accept the principal remit of the committee is to account for public expenditure.  I am frustrated at the situation.  It was one of the first things that was dropped on my desk when I was appointed as Secretary General in the Department.

The suggestion to use Standing Order 163 to facilitate a private discussion can be called upon as we deal with the issue.  From the point of view of what is contained in the chapter, we can examine it publicly to the point where the witnesses feel it is necessary to go into private session.  We can deal with the Vote separately and then deal with chapter 15 and we can decide to go into private session for the parts of the discussion that are sensitive in terms of the case the office is taking.  We share the view that we must protect taxpayers' money, whether it is the case that money has been spent with poor efficiency or where the State has been left exposed.

The figure for the cost of judicial reviews and other legal costs in 2012, in so far as the service is provided by the legal services support unit of the repatriation division, was &euro;4.36 million, which includes the figure for legal challenges taken against decisions to deport or transfer, as well as for challenges to decisions taken by the INIS's EU treaty rights, general immigration and family reunification areas.  A small proportion of the costs involve arises from other legal challenges to procedural decisions in the asylum immigration process, for example, inquiries under Article 40.4 of the Constitution in respect of detention and injunction hearings.  That figure does not include the cost of judicial review proceedings taken against the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal or the citizenship division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  As I said, overall legal costs for all INIS and related areas amounted to &euro;8.6 million and &euro;6.3 million for the years 2011 and 2012, respectively.<\/p><p>  Where the courts rule in favour of an applicant, legal costs in a case are usually awarded against the Minister and the applicant's costs are met from the Minister's Vote.  The applicant's costs may also be met from the Minister's Vote in certain cases arising from settlements between the parties.  The Minister's own legal costs which are very significant are met from the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor's office and, consequently, are reflected in the figure given.  Contributions towards the Minister's legal costs have been received from the applicants in a small number of cases and recovery of these costs was managed by the Chief State Solicitor's office.<\/p><p>  On processing times, one of the matters on which we have received a certain level of criticism during the years has been the asylum system and the length of time it takes to process asylum applications, with the duration of waiting times regularly quoted in years.  That view is not necessarily correct and may sometimes be informed by a misunderstanding of the processing system.  In 2012 the Minister made 1,023 decisions on refugee status.  The medium processing time of asylum applications, including the appeal stage, in this period was 8.3 months.  Persons who are refused asylum enter what is commonly referred to as the leave to remain process under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process.  The leave to remain process involves consideration of applications for subsidiary protection and other reasons a failed asylum seeker may present for remaining in the State.  The processing of such cases is complex and extremely resource intensive.  The investigation of the subsidiary protection application requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of the objective and reputable up-to-date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether the applicant is likely to be exposed to serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin.  Where such an application is refused, consideration must be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Act, at which point the Minister must make a decision as to whether to make a deportation order in respect of the person concerned.  All of this must be carried out in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make, given the life-changing consequences for the persons involved and because of this, decisions must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.  <\/p><p>  Steps have been taken to speed up the processing of applications, initially by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies and more recently by the decision to establish a case processing panel of legally qualified graduates to assist in clearing the backlog.  In addition, we hope the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013032100007#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1363862400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Given what Mr. Purcell has just said, will he inform me of the current position on the target time for dealing with an initial asylum application?

As has often been seen, because of the difficult circumstances in which many people find themselves as they come into the system, there can be issues in relation to documentation not being available.

Alternatively, if we put down tighter target times, we would almost be putting them down in the certain knowledge that we would not be able to meet them.  The hope is that when the immigration Bill is brought through, it will go some way towards streamlining the process and enabling quicker delivery.  We are not trying to avoid anything or make things easy for ourselves because, as the Deputy knows well from his experience in dealing with these cases, they are so complex that it is difficult to estimate at the beginning how long they will take.

A value for money report in 2010 stated there was no cheaper alternative to direct provision.  However, we constantly give consideration to options for reductions in the cost of the accommodation provision given the tight nature of the available budget.  Due to the exceptionally difficult state of the national finances and in response to the need for all Departments to achieve such reductions, we have been looking closely at expenditure in all areas, including the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA.  In that context, we sought and achieved a reduction in spending by an overall 6% from April to December 2009.  That was the equivalent, over a full year, to 8% and these savings continue to be implemented through 2010, 2011, 2012 and beyond.  Together with the rate and bed reductions achieved under this exercise, we have been able to deliver a level of savings that has enabled us to live within our overall budget.<\/p><p>  We monitor closely all elements of the cost in the centres and continually strive to deliver value for money.  One thing we have tried to do in more recent years is to reduce the level of vacant beds we are obliged to carry in the system.  We have managed to achieve that to a point where we never have more than a maximum of 10% of vacant beds in the system.  We have had this in place since 2011.  It is a large and complex undertaking and as the Deputy is aware, it initially was introduced in a crisis situation and has evolved subsequently.  The primary objective is to provide a level of accommodation and service that is suitable in the particular circumstances.

The experience we have had, however - and this is reflected in other systems elsewhere - is that the underlying question people ask is whether they can stay there.  This question means that even after a determination has been made, they will continue to seek to stay there through every mechanism in place.  It does go the full run of every challenge.  In cases where decisions are taken that people are not going to stay, it can be a long drawn out process.  That, effectively, is the nature of the system.  One could possibly deal with cases much more quickly by getting a decision and then people would be out of the country altogether.

We are grateful to have the opportunity to address the sub-committee on the important topic of angling tourism with particular reference to sea angling.<\/p><p>  Sea angling is a component of the mix of economic pursuits that make up inshore water-based activities.  The mix in the inshore area requires State, commercial and recreational users to contribute to a delicate balance between sometimes complementary but often competing interests.  The angling sector is estimated to contribute in excess of &euro;500 million annually to the national economy and to underpin employment and income earning for around 10,000 people, mostly in peripheral and rural communities and particularly along the western seaboard.  Sea angling, which is the particular focus of the sub-committee, attracts almost 100,000 participants and generates income of approximately &euro;100 million which is spent almost entirely in the communities in which the activity is based.  We make our presentation to assist the sub-committee in its consideration of the tourism angling sector and to show where sea angling fits into that area.  It is timely to address the sub-committee as Inland Fisheries Ireland is about to publish a comprehensive study of the national angling product and of the requirements and expectations of the customer, both domestic and overseas.  The study is currently being finalised.<\/p><p>  The study asked anglers, both domestic and international, what their expectations were and its results will offer a strategic guide to build on development plans for the sector to underpin employment and income in the angling sector and in the related hospitality and transport areas.  I stress again that the income generated from angling is spent almost entirely within local communities, which concentration on local earning and spending is almost unique in the inshore sector.  Our presentations will outline some of the most revealing results of the study and provide the sub-committee with a sense of the value and development potential of the sector while emphasising the importance of recreational sea angling to continued viable income generation in coastal communities.<\/p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland, a statutory, independent agency under the aegis of the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources, is responsible for the conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource and recreational sea angling.  It has also a remit to promote the inland fisheries and sea angling resource.  IFI has national responsibilities under the EU habitats directive, the water framework directive and eel regulations.  IFI is mindful that the inshore area is vital to coastal communities, and exploitation of this sensitive resource requires a balance among sustainable developments across all sectors, underpinned by a cohesive approach among stakeholders.  It also requires a balance with the State's international obligations on the environment, conservation, biodiversity and natural resource management.  IFI is active in offering inputs to support and advise on development proposals which might impact areas in which we have expertise.  The key objective is to facilitate sectors to develop in a manner that protects as far as possible finite resources and ensures that developments benefit to the greatest extent possible the local communities in which they are based.<\/p><p>  IFI's development strategy for angling and sea angling in particular is based around keeping visitors returning to Ireland because the quality of the fishing and the support services are second to none.  We must continually reinforce the message that Ireland is an angling paradise, that the infrastructure and information are available to provide for a wonderful angling holiday experience and that there is a real welcome for anglers and the euro they bring.  IFI has an agreed angling marketing strategy with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  It also works on an all-island basis with Northern Ireland's Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Loughs Agency to market Irish angling internationally.  IFI supports its industry and trade partners to produce information, attend trade shows, market directly to customers and develop the angling product.  IFI's business development section is resourced to deliver on IFI's aim to increase the number of anglers and increase the return from angling and inland fisheries to Ireland.<\/p><p>  Stable development and balanced exploitation is the cornerstone of IFI's resource management strategy.  The ongoing collaboration between IFI and its partners can ensure Ireland develops sustainably as a top-class angling destination.  The development of sea angling and angling tourism in general requires a modern legislative base.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who has responsibility for the inland fisheries resource, has advanced a project to modernise and simplify the entire inland fisheries legislative code.  This project will serve the sector well into the future.  The review of legislation will go to public consultation in the near future.  A key overriding objective of the legislative project is to put in place a statutory basis for IFI to develop the potential of the sector by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in its development and to maximise the returns from inland fisheries to local communities and the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363858200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Inland Fisheries Ireland is the body charged with the conservation, protection, development, management and promotion of the inland fisheries resource and sea angling.

That brings people into Fenit, and Banna Beach and gives a great boost to the local economy.  The figures show the value of this, for example, the participation of 97,000 people in the sea-angling and almost 750,000 trips a year.  This is very significant.

There is potential to develop the industry, particularly sea angling.  We must assist traditional fishermen to avail of new opportunities in the angling sector.<\/p><p>  The committee started its hearing with submissions from the Aranmore islanders on the loss of wild salmon fisheries due to a ban on drift nets.  The islanders sought to retain the salmon fisheries rather than diversify because they view themselves as traditional fisherman.  That is what they want to be.  We must find a way to allow traditional fishermen to continue yet examine other opportunities for them.  <\/p><p>  It was mentioned in the presentation that the industry supports 10,000 rural jobs.  I presume that includes all angling, including river angling.  How many jobs does sea angling provide?  Can the delegation outline its projections for growth?  What supports are needed to allow growth to take place?  How much does it cost a boat or sea angling provider to enter the sector if they decide to diversify?  I presume that a traditional fishing boat would not be incompatible with an angling vessel.  Therefore, diversification would require a new or second vessel.  Has the delegation researched how it could work with traditional fishermen to combine an angling product with traditional fishing?  Can traditional fishermen do both for a period while he or she develops his or her business?  <\/p><p>  I have questions on the support given to fishermen who want to take up angling.  The European fisheries fund provided funding for diversification and for fishermen displaced due to restrictions imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy.  Has the delegation ever targeted that funding to develop an angling product?  We know that Ireland has never targeted any funding from the fund.  When compared with countries like Spain we have neglected to apply for potential funding.  A vital part of a proposed development is funding.  It is all right having a report that proves that people want a product but if we cannot put the infrastructure in place then it will be impossible to capitalise on the initiative.  The cost of entry into the sector is significant enough to make it difficult for small fishermen to join.<\/p><p>   I presume that the committee will address the salmon issue at a later date.  Salmon fishing might be another day's work.

Obviously the infrastructure of small piers are essential for people to access the sea.  I am not referring to the larger piers at Rossaveal or Killybegs.  The piers in much smaller communities are inadequate.  One example is Dunbeg, County Clare but there are other examples in the county.  Dunbeg has a lot of tourism footfall, the area also has a well known golf course which attracts a lot of tourists and it has become a wedding venue.  Dunbeg has a small pier which is inadequate because it is tidal and people can only access the pier at certain tides.  The community is very active and hosts a well known drama festival which also attracts tourists.  The community is doing everything possible to develop tourism.  Dunbeg is on the coast so sea angling would be a normal extension of its tourism product.  However, the pier is inadequate and tidal.  There is money available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop piers but only when the project has passed the stages of planning and environmental impact statements.  Both those stages must be undertaken by Clare County Council but it does not have the money to progress the project.  The community has been left with no option and cannot develop the infrastructure, a potential source of extra tourism that could also retain tourists that visit Dunbeg.  Can the delegation do anything for piers in places like Dunbeg?  There are small piers dotted along the coast ranging from Donegal, to west Cork and around the east coast.  Is there a proposal to build piers?  Is there a proposal to get piers to a stage where they can be built and then apply for funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  <\/p><p>  I have a few questions on sea lice.  Is sea lice an increasing problem?  Does it impact on sea angling?  What measures can be taken to mitigate the problem?<\/p><p>  Is IFI, a Government agency, happy with the general degree of co-operation by BIM?  Obviously IFI and BIM are Government agencies with different remits but they both work in the same waters.  How has BIM treated submissions by Inland Fisheries Ireland?  I do not know whether the submissions can be discussed but I do expect an answer on the general co-operation between IFI and BIM.  <\/p><p>   On 6 March the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated that Food Harvest 2020 constituted a Government strategic plan.  Does Inland Fisheries Ireland think that the agriculture component of the plan should be submitted for an environmental impact statement?  I ask the question in view of the potential impact by Food Harvest 2020 on sea angling and the development of tourism off our coasts.    <\/p><p>  I know that weir fisheries are not within our remit.  However, I commend the work done by Inland Fisheries Ireland and the ESB on eel fisheries, particularly at Parteen weir.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100007#F00400","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Maher on legislative review.

In a previous Administration, I had meetings with all State agencies responsible for State lands.  The State is the biggest landowner in the country.  The idea was to utilise State lands to the greatest extent.  To that extent, the IFI is working very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We have been activating rural recreation officers to get them involved in angling and we also worked on the national trails development programme.  We are not there yet and there is a huge job of work to be done.  The survey shows we are scratching the surface in terms of what we can do.  In this context, I am concerned about angling but when one comes off the canal, one should be able to go fishing or on a Coillte mountain bike trail or a walk.  It involves linking those activities.<\/p><p>  In terms of the angling product, we are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We have a strategy entitled \"Travel, Stay, Fish &amp;amp; Play\".  We are responsible for the fish portion of that but, as others have pointed out, if the travel, stay and play elements are not sorted out, it does not matter how good the fishing is.  If one cannot get in or cannot satisfy the kids or the wife, it does not come together.  The initiatives Ms Campion talked about, such as with Donegal angling, show the suppliers realising that sometimes it gets windy and wet in Donegal and one may not be able to go sea fishing so an alternative is provided.  Equally, if one cannot go lake fishing, one should give sea fishing a go.  People are linking accommodation providers and chartered providers.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is helpful because it gives us a certain classification and people can get an angler's welcome.  When people see the angler's welcome ticket, they know there may be somewhere to store the tackle, some freezer capacity for fish, somewhere to store bait or the ability to have lunches made when they are going fishing.  These small things can make a difference between someone coming to Ireland and going elsewhere.  We are working closely on that.<\/p><p>  We have had many questions about the survey.  The survey is the first part of our strategy, which we have not yet developed.  The IFI is under three years old and this is the first time we have sat down to consider angling in Ireland in a comprehensive way.  We are starting to get results that will form the foundation of the sectoral plan.  We have huge figures but we must think about how to grow them further and where are the best places to grow them.  In order to develop a strategy for angling, we must consider what we have currently.  Where is there really good quality and where is there poor quality?  Deputy McNamara asked about our infrastructure.  It may be that we have a major deficit in piers but an oversupply of angling stands in lakes.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about illegal fishing.  Long before us, currently, and long after us there will be people willing to partake in illegal fishing.  Perception is very important because it acts like a magnifying glass.  With the advent of social media, blogs and Twitter, someone sees an illegal fishing net and can get onto Facebook.  It can go viral.  The perception of what is going on is worse than what is going on.  Illegal fishing is taking place but we are working very hard to contain it.  It is not as significant a problem as some make it out to be.  The tourist will have a particular perception if they see someone with an illegal net, and that is what we are trying to avoid.  Things move through social media very quickly and so what gets out on viral media is not the reality on the ground.  People have posted comments on the IFI Facebook page and then genuine anglers on that river or lake have also commented that they did not see what was reported or that the matter was blown out of all proportion.  Illegal sea netting for salmon and bass is a problem and we are working very closely with stakeholders.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out that when people have shared ownership, instantly they have responsibility.  Irrespective of what the State says or does, they take a greater interest.  That is why we are pushing forward with the value of angling locally and people are starting to grab hold of the idea.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked about depleted bass stocks.  The bass stock is very much depleted.  The estimate is that there is a recovery in the stock but only to 5% or 10% of its historic level.  Bass is a commercial fish species managed for recreational angling.  It is a long living species and it is not particularly suitable for commercial fishing.  If the stock is fished hard for whatever reason, it takes a long time to recover.  Much of the bass angling practised at the moment is on a catch and release basis.  The reason the bass angling product is developing well in Ireland is because England, France and Spain have commercial bass fisheries but no bass angling.  Ireland is the last remaining Mecca for bass angling.  It should be maintained as a recreation angling species given the status of the stock and the biology of the species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100008#G00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363861200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris makes the point well that bass fishing is taking place offshore in other countries.

We must sit down and chew over it, decide the best way forward, the resource and the issues involved.  Only then do we bring in the stakeholders.  One of the members mentioned the coastal local authorities, which have a huge remit in angling and tourism promotion.  We have had some very positive interaction with Kerry County Council.  Ms Campion will brief members on that.  When we get a clear understanding of the figures, we will be in a position to speak to local authorities, who will be key stakeholders.  Without a base of information, it is a stab in the dark.<\/p><p>  If this is where we are now, what can we do?  Mr. Maher referred to legislation and barriers to entry.  Deputy Pringle asked how we can interface commercial inshore fisheries into recreational angling.  That will form part of our strategy.<\/p><p>  With regard to species under threat, a general comment is that there is pressure on many of the inshore fishing stocks.  We are interested in recreational angling.  To a large extent, it is a sustainable activity.  When fishing with a rod and line, there is only so much angling pressure people put on a fishery.  I cannot speak for my colleagues in the Marine Institute or BIM but I am sure they would concur that there is pressure on inshore stocks.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle's questions also relate to the number of jobs related to sea angling.  I do not subscribe to the paralysis by analysis idea but a survey such as this begets other questions, which we must answer.  If we are to develop the strategy, we must have more resolution.  Of the 10,000 jobs, we must decide how many to ascribe to sea angling.  This involves what to do with charter skippers and what inputs we include.

I will lead off but will refer to Dr. Byrne, as he is the scientist.  The major issue in the debate centres around the issue of sea lice.  I appreciate Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on sea angling.  It is the impact on angling<i> per se <\/i>and the statutory responsibility of IFI that would be of concern.  It is fair to say - I am sure Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Ferris will know this from their own areas - that the debate on sea lice has been ongoing for more than 20 years.  It is characterised among stakeholders by entrenched views, with very hard-hitting statements made by those supporting the project and equally hard views expressed by the angling community.  We need to move beyond the arguments of the past 20 years.  I have a background in seafood, where I worked for ten years, and I understand the arguments put by both sides.  I believe we need to move it on.  What we have suggested is an independent review of all the scientific data from both sets of stakeholders, which would allow for some level of accord among stakeholders.  That is the key.<\/p><p>  In respect of aquaculture, we have consistently said - as have both Ministers - that we will give 100% support to aquaculture projects that do not have an impact on other areas.  That is what I spoke about earlier with regard to a cohesive response across all stakeholders, including agencies.  We have made suggestions about where the location should be but there is disagreement on the scientific elements.  We have consistently said we support the development of aquaculture as long as its impact is not detrimental to any sector.

On the question of whether an aquaculture facility will have an impact on sea angling, I do not believe it will have a significant negative impact.  A poorly managed facility could have a significant impact on wild salmonid fisheries, as the Deputy is aware from the Corrib river.  If the facility is well managed I do not believe it will have a significant impact, but it is down to perception.  When one is trying to get a tourist to book a trip to Ireland and pay money online, an aquaculture facility is likely to have a somewhat negative effect on the perception of sea angling.  It may have little or no impact on the actual fishing, but one is managing the perception.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle raised the issue of drift netting in Arranmore Island.

Inland Fisheries Ireland has been working with Leader companies all over the country and been successful in helping small groups and businesses to secure some Leader funding.  As members will be aware, the Leader window is pretty much shut as the applications in hand are being assessed.  Concerns have arisen about transferring Leader funding to socioeconomic committees in county councils.  Some time ago Inland Fisheries Ireland made a proposal to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that we be permitted to be a lead promoter or project promoter.  We did so because we found that smaller angling clubs, chartered skippers and so forth did not always have the wherewithal either to fund a project or put one together.  Inland Fisheries Ireland cannot obtain Leader funding.  While we do not want funds for the organisation, we want stakeholders to secure funding and have a policy of facilitating them in doing so.  We have provided what are known as &quot;How-To&quot; guides for the Leader programme and assist and design projects where we have resources to do so.  Unfortunately, our resources are not evenly spread around the country.  However, in areas where we have resources, we are working with Leader companies at a level close to project design.<\/p><p>  The South Kerry Development Company is working with Kerry County Council and Inland Fisheries Ireland to develop the <i>GoKerry.com<\/i> angling website which will provide a one stop shop of game fisheries, accommodation providers and so forth that will enable people to book a holiday, guide, accommodation and fishing licences.

Its key role is to get people involved in the marine and countryside sector to become guides and offer a tourism service to anglers or others who want to participate in marine and countryside activities.  It allows people to change roles, for example, to move from commercial fishing to guiding.  Local knowledge is best in fisheries.  A number of providers have entered from overseas, have learned the Irish way and know where the best fishing is.  They practise catch and release and bring many tourists to the country through different companies.  They live in Ireland and do a fantastic job in promoting the country to our tourist friends elsewhere in Europe.  They are always crying out for guides and gillies with local knowledge.

The 1959 Fisheries Act is 53 years old and of its day because it is based on legislation that predates the founding of the State.  It is increasingly no longer fit for purpose.  The legislation we are proposing contains a number of key elements, one of which is the decriminalisation of some of the minor offences contained in the Act.  It is hoped we will introduce a system akin to the penalty points system, rather than continuing to criminalise infringements and waste court time with minor offences, some of which have been committed inadvertently.  Another key area relates to invasive species which have the potential to destroy native species.  As there is no legislation on invasive species, legislative provision must be made on this issue.<\/p><p>  We spoke of perceptions in terms of protecting the fishery resource and illegal fishing.  As Deputies are aware, we are in an era of tightening resources.  We would like to legislate to create a fisheries reserve.

Legislating to create a fisheries reserve to act alongside our inspectors would create opportunities for Inland Fisheries Ireland to deploy its resources more effectively, for example, by using surveillance technology rather than constantly patrolling rivers.

With regard to the Natura 2000 sites around our coast, when this committee was dealing with its work in this area, these sites featured hugely, no matter where one went along the coast.  In the aquaculture area for example, in the period since 1993, when the Natura 2000 sites designations were made, aquaculture developed in Scotland at ten times the rate it did here although Scotland had to observe the same habitats directive as we did and had to designate sites.  I do not know where it designated its sites, whether they were inland or offshore, or how it managed to do it and still develop its aquaculture, but it was working under the same European legislation as us. The perception exists here that much of the licensing restriction that has inhibited an aquaculture industry in this country is because of the Natura sites in the bays and harbours around our coast.<\/p><p>  Another issue is that because of the lack of scientific information when these sites were designated, if a licence came in for a new activity - whether based on tourism, the marine or aquaculture - there was no way of assessing the impact of that proposed activity.  In the presentation made to the committee yesterday, we were told the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had to start from scratch to develop a data model to assemble the information to assess the impact such a licence would have on a Natura site.  We have gone about this backwards.  We have a Department that is trying to develop an aquaculture industry to fit the targets of Food Harvest 2020, but to do that it had to start from scratch to get the scientific data.  It worked in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others to get a base model.  Obviously there was some scientific information available, but it was not sufficient to allow an educated or informed decision on licensing.  The Department has informed us that it can now use its model not just for aquaculture but for anything.   This effort has been going on from 1993 up to the past year or so.  Therefore, why is it that in the context of the economic and social impact of the designation of Natura sites, for example, the information does not add up?<\/p><p>  We have seen countries which have been working under the same legislation outstrip us by a factor of ten.  The perception that exists must be dealt with.  Whether wrongly or rightly, communities here feel very hard done by, not by the designation of the Natura sites, but by the inability to move ahead and deal with applications.  That is the problem.  We have fallen 20 years behind in this regard.  If that perception is wrong, we should deal with that.  How we can move ahead is something with which this committee must deal.  If we are going to come up with a report, we must show how we can move forward in these areas.  If we want to introduce tourism infrastructure, aquaculture or marine leisure or sea fishery projects in these areas, we must be able to assess their impact on these areas.  If we can deal with this, we should, but if the requirement for an impact assessment is going to continue to inhibit progress this should be a fundamental part of our report.  We need to be able to tell people whether they can or cannot progress a development in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100012#L00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I have read the document and would like to make one comment and to pose a question.

Research I have done indicates the regime is completely different in every other European country.  The explanation for this seems to be that we took a court case and they did not.

The Heritage Council, which is funded by our Department, has also provided the group with substantial support over the years.<\/p><p>  With regard to the general designations issue, it is correct to say that things did not move as fast here as they did in other countries.  There are a number of reasons for that.  First, we started off with very little baseline data in comparison with other European countries, which had substantial research institutions working on the basic information and they had that information to hand when the habitats directive was introduced.  We did not have the same level of information.  The clock was ticking in Europe and designations had to be made within a certain time, yet the collection of the basic information to determine whether the sites are worthy of protection takes significant time.<\/p><p>  When it comes to licensing, ideally one would have all the information needed from the first day of the notification, but it was simply not possible, within the resources afforded, to get all of the information.  Therefore, we have been working very hard and have been co-funding the work on the data gathering with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so that small industries do not have to try to get that information.  In many other cases where a developer wants to do a project, he must pay for EIA work.  In this case, the State is doing the work in order to enable the licensing process to go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100012#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>If the basic information was not available in the first place, how were the Natura sites designated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100012#L00500","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363864200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>When the habitats directive was introduced, that base information was not available so it had to be collected.

The first step was a national survey, called BioMar, which was carried out in the 1990s and it identified those areas with the richest biodiversity which fell within the parameters of the Habitats Directive as the best sites.  That study identified bays, areas of coastline and so forth.  However, when it comes down to an individual wanting to set up an operation in a very specific location, the question arises as to whether we have sufficiently detailed data to make an informed decision in the context of the European Court case.  That was not the case so substantial additional work had to be carried out in order to enable an informed and legally satisfactory decision on a licence application.  Deputy Pringle is correct that, having been through the hoops in the European Court, the burden was onerous in terms of the quality of the work that was required, which has made life more difficult than it would have been had we passed under the radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032100013#M00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363864200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I shall just refer back to Deputy Harrington's comments because they are particularly relevant.  Approximately 13 years ago I was in the Civil Service in the United Kingdom doing very similar work.  I raise this in the context of the question about how Scotland managed matters effectively while we, under the same legislation, seem to have stumbled.  From first-hand experience I can say that the type of products we are generating now were being generated 13 years ago in the United Kingdom.  That was after they had collected the necessary data in the middle to late 1990s.  Obviously, when the European Commission came calling, the UK was in a better position to make more informed decisions and to apply the regime of appropriate assessment to the decision making process.  When Brussels looked around the member states at the time, it found that Ireland was making little headway in applying the appropriate assessment provision to aquaculture licensing.  One of the main reasons was that, as Dr. O'Keeffe has said, while we had some data, it was only sufficient for designation purposes and not for spatial management of activities within sites.  It is one thing to be able to take a sample at sea and determine that an area is an inlet, bay or estuary or that there is a large reef in a site.  That is enough to have a site designated but in order to spatially manage the complexity of activities within a site like Galway Bay, for example, one needs a much greater amount of detail, a lot more samples and a lot more analysis.

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland, Mr. James Higgins from the European Youth Forum and Mr. Dermot Stokes, an ex-member of Youthreach.<\/p><p>  As members will know, at the end of the February the Council of the European Union reached political agreement on a recommendation addressed to the member states to establish a youth guarantee scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 who lose their jobs or who do not find work after finishing formal education quickly receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, or an apprenticeship or traineeship.  The guarantee states that they should receive such an offer within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  The guarantee is intended to provide for a smooth transition between school and work, support labour market integration and make sure that no young person is left out.  The measure is a key part of the response to the worsening youth unemployment situation in Europe.  In Ireland, youth unemployment stands at 32% and in countries such as Spain, the unemployment rate for those under 25 is almost 50%.  We all recognise that something needs to be done and this committee is interested in exploring how the proposed scheme might work in practice.  In that context, we look forward to hearing the views of our witnesses today on how such a scheme might work and whether it could be customised for the Irish market.  <\/p><p>  I wish to draw attention to the parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against an individual or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it easily identifiable.   By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100003#B00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363875000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>On behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the youth guarantee.<\/p><p>  The NYCI is the representative body for more than 50 organisations working with young people in almost every community in Ireland.  We have 40,000 volunteers working in the youth sector in Ireland and around 1,400 full-time-equivalent staff.  A lot of people work on a part-time basis but the overall figure is approximately 1,400 whole-time equivalents.  A recent independent assessment of the number of young people participating in programmes run by youth organisations in Ireland showed that there were about 382,000 in the 10-to-24 age group involved.  A significant number of young people are, therefore, engaged with our member services and 53% of those young people are from what can be described as economically and socially disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p>  Members are well aware of the seriousness of youth unemployment, but there have been some changes in that regard since the crisis first hit.  The number of young people on the live register has dropped relatively significantly since 2010, by approximately 23,000 to 24,000.  Alongside that, however, we have seen an increase in long-term youth unemployment.  At the end of October 2012 there were 30,000 young people who had been signing on the live register for 12 months or more.  There has also been a significant amount of emigration, with estimates indicating that 142,000 people under 25 have emigrated.  Obviously, many more between the ages of 25 and 30 have also left.  Even though the number of unemployed young people has come down, the number of young people in the labour force has also dropped.  In 2012, the labour force participation rate for young people fell by about 10%.  Between 2008 and 2012, the number of young people under 25 in the workforce almost halved.  It is important to put those figures on the record to demonstrate the scale of the crisis we are facing.<\/p><p>  Levels of youth unemployment are directly related to levels of education and qualifications, which is not a new phenomenon.  International and national studies have shown that young people insulate themselves against unemployment to some degree by continuing in education.  High educational attainment will not provide complete protection against joblessness; figures show that the level of unemployment among young graduates was around 18%, but among those educated only to primary level it was 70%.  Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people who are in the so-called NEET category, meaning they are not in employment, education or training.  The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions estimated that it costs approximately &euro;150 billion per year, at a European level, to have that number of young people not engaged in the workforce or in training.  The cost to Ireland is estimated to be &euro;3 billion per annum.  My colleague Mr. James Higgins from the European Youth Forum will talk some more about the European dimension, but the committee might be interested to note that recent statistics indicate that there are almost 14 million young people between 15 and 29 who are not in education, employment or training.  That is equal to the population of seven member states - admittedly, seven of the smaller states - and is a staggering figure.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of education and training, we are of the view that while there has been some increase in the availability of some of the existing schemes, as well as new initiatives such as Springboard, MOMENTUM and JobBridge, overall, there are not enough places and opportunities to meet the demand.  A few weeks ago an affiliate of one of our member organisations in Tipperary had a meeting to recruit 20 young people for a training course, but 120 turned up.  Mr. Stokes would know more about this than I do, but there is evidence that many Youthreach centres have long waiting lists for their services.  The lack of capacity is a major issue.  We are particularly concerned that the young people who have the lowest level of educational qualifications and who may be dealing with other issues such as lack of parental support, bad experiences in school and so forth are being pushed to the back of the queue.  The increase in unemployment has been so great and the demand for training courses so extensive that the young people with greater resources at their disposal are the ones who end up getting a lot of the training places, to the detriment of those who might need those places most.  We did an analysis of some of the existing Government programmes and found that the number of long-term unemployed young people participating in some of them was very low, which is a worry.  Additional efforts are required to address this issue.  Youthreach is certainly doing a lot of excellent work but, as far as I am aware, the capacity of Youthreach has not been increased significantly since the start of the crisis.  <\/p><p>  We are also concerned about the quality of some of the programmes and courses on offer.  While there is a lot of good work being done, there are some courses and training opportunities which are short-term and not very well targeted, whose value to participants is not clear or which may not be useful in leading to either further education or employment.  We are spending significant resources in this area but the question arises as to whether those resources are being spent wisely and well.<\/p><p>  We strongly welcome the youth guarantee and the decision of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Council last month to agree it.  We compliment the Irish Government on securing that agreement.  The NYCI was one of the first organisations in this country to call for a youth guarantee and for one to be implemented in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Is the figure for young people 35,000?

The &euro;6 billion is welcome but perhaps Mr. Higgins has more expertise on that issue and I will leave it to him.  Anyway, there is an issue in that the Irish Government will have to provide matching funding and this is something we need to address.  I do not believe that somehow all of this money will come from Europe.  Sometimes there is a sense that it will always come from Europe but we know that is not the case.  However, Ireland is in a strong position to draw down significant resources from the fund.<\/p><p>  We are keen to put the issue of the private sector on the table.  The private sector benefits from the education and training of young people and many sectors of the economy have vacancies.  There is a question of whether the private sector could contribute as well.  It is clear that there is a lack of capacity.  If the Government decided to implement a youth guarantee in the morning, we simply would not have sufficient training, education or work experience places.  I am not suggesting it cannot be ramped up over time, but we certainly need to consider that issue.  Another issue we have identified is that there has not been the right emphasis.  We need a national emphasis but we need to engage with groups at local level as well.  I imagine all Deputies and Senators are aware of great work that is being done at local level.  We should engage with the community and voluntary sectors to deliver some of these places as well as ramping up schemes such as Youthreach and others.<\/p><p>  It is important we do not increase the number of places for the sake of it.  We must have regard to equality and progression.  We need to ensure young people benefit from the programme, especially young people who have had a bad experience of the education system and who perhaps have other issues.  Such people may need longer-term supports to enable them to get the benefits from education and training.  Some young people may have literacy or addiction issues and we believe we need to do more in that regard.  We do not want a situation whereby a young person goes through the youth guarantee process but ends up in a part-time or temporary job on low pay, because he or she will simply end up back on the live register within a short period.<\/p><p>  We need to put in considerable efforts in Ireland to determine how we can implement this in the best way possible and how to make the best use of resources.  There is also another concern.  The United Kingdom introduced what was known as a payment-by-results model.  The Irish Government is considering the introduction of third parties from the private sector to the activation system.  As far as I am aware in the United Kingdom, the payment-by-results model involved getting a cohort of people off the live register and moving them into employment.  Those responsible were paid based on the percentage of those who were brought into employment.  However, some of those people were progressed into not very satisfactory employment.  There was also a tendency to cherry pick those who were close to the labour market and those who needed least support.  We need to consider these issues carefully.<\/p><p>  We believe there is a need to concentrate primarily on the most disadvantaged young people.  We are now four or five years into the crisis.  One could argue that we are heading towards the previous scenario again but we do not want to create the problem which we had in the 1980s and 1990s whereby we created a cohort of people who were long-term unemployed and who needed a great deal of support to get back into the labour force.  In particular we are calling for an emphasis on the long-term unemployed, especially the 30,000 people who have been unemployed for more than one year and the 17,000 people who have been unemployed for two years.  They need a particular focus.  The youth guarantees in Sweden and Finland, which have been quite successful, were not as successful with this cohort.  We believe that the youth sector and the organisations we represent, which are working with young people and which have credibility in communities, could play a role.  We have already spoken to the Government in this regard and in terms of putting forward proposals that some of the money coming from the youth guarantee should be designated to address the hardest to reach and the most disadvantaged young people.  If it is not, there is a danger they will be marginalised and left behind once again.  I will leave it there but I will be glad to answer any questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I call Mr James Higgins from the European Youth Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100004#C00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363875600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I am glad to be here.  I will give some European context to the debate.  On 28 February, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, approved a recommendation for a youth guarantee.  This directly followed the European Commission proposal as part of its youth employment package at the end of last year.  The Council recommended that member states begin to implement the scheme as soon as possible and preferably from the start of 2014.  I will provide some rationale behind the scheme.  Mr. Doorley said it is based on a Nordic model of early labour market activation measures which have been in operation in some ways since the 1980s.  Sweden first introduced the job guarantee, as it was termed, in 1984.  It was followed shortly afterwards by other Scandinavian countries, including Finland.  There have been many reworkings of these schemes since they were first introduced and there is a good deal that European member states can learn from the way these countries have had to adapt and change schemes to allow for the way the labour market has changed, specifically with regard to young people.<\/p><p>  One significant element of the Commission's proposal was the idea that youth organisations and the representatives of young people should be involved in the design and implementation of the scheme.  The reason for this, as Mr. Doorley remarked, is that it is difficult, unfortunately, to reach long-term unemployed young people because of some of the issues of social exclusion that arise for them.  Often, it requires civil society organisations to intervene.<\/p><p>  One major advantage of the youth guarantee, in the way it has been implemented in the Nordic model, is that it prevents the onset of long-term unemployment when it is implemented correctly.  Unfortunately, statistics show that long-term unemployment is growing in Europe as a whole.  It has increased by 3.7% since 2008 and it is increasing at a rate higher than the adult rate of long-term unemployment.  This is almost unheard of considering that young people usually do not fall into long-term unemployment in the same way as older people.<\/p><p>  I will outline the way it has been implemented in Sweden and Denmark.  As Mr. Doorley remarked, the programme costs approximately &euro;6,600 per participant under the Swedish model and there is considerable popularity for the scheme there.  In 2008, approximately 10,000 young people were participating in the scheme in Sweden and that figure is currently at 53,000.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the youth guarantee in the short term places a large strain on public employment services.  There needs to be a reorientation of public employment services in some ways towards the uptake from young people.  I will offer one example.  In Finland in 2009, due to an increased demand from young people, there was only one youth adviser for every 700 young people participating in the scheme.  Therefore, Finland had to invest radically in the scheme, but it had a good deal of success.  In 2010, Finland put more public expenditure towards it and there was successful intervention for 83.5% of young people participating.

In Ireland it led to the establishment of community training centres, subsequently the Youthreach programme and PLCs, initially as VPT.  It became the trigger or the driver of quite substantial system change.  It is important to bear this in mind.  I have now retired from active service, as it were, but I have been doing a study for the OECD on local youth employment strategies.  I am bringing some of the encounters from that study to this discussion.<\/p><p>  I will begin by stating that youth is changing.  In 1994 when the social guarantee was in place, the transition between school and employment, between youth and independent adulthood, was a fairly straightforward.  It was, relatively speaking, a short experience.  Now, a generation later, youth begins earlier; physical puberty is achieved earlier and independent adult status is achieved later.  Therefore, adolescence, <i>per se<\/i>, has been stretched out now between the ages of 12 and 25 - some would say even later - before emerging adulthood.  It has become an extended and quite complex process.  It is important to understand this process.  We may think that helping young people to find a stable place in the labour market is a simple exercise but in the modern context that is not actually the case.<\/p><p>  Work is also changing.  Young people now have a greater capacity to communicate and much greater personal freedom but there is also much less structure and predictability and jobs are of shorter duration.  This has a significant impact on how services conceive the idea of jobs and the transitions.  Although there is increased mobility, the crisis has eroded the shield that qualifications provided.  Now it is the case that unemployed young people include those with degrees.  This was not the case ten or 20 years ago when a degree was a pretty good shield against unemployment.  There are also significant levels of under-employment and part-time employment.  The guarantee is not just a matter of switching on somebody who is stuck; it is a much more complex process.  <\/p><p>  In Ireland we are engaged in a major and extremely ambitious reform programme with regard to employment services, education and training structures and provision and reform of local government.  These are very onerous reforms to be attempting while at the same time also trying to deal with a very complex issue such as youth employment and unemployment.<\/p><p>  There is no youth employment strategy.  One can infer a strategy from what is there but there is not such a strategy in place.  We have to acknowledge that the Irish education and training system is socially reproductive.  There are high levels of retention - meaning more people staying in education up to leaving certificate level - which is unusual in the European context.  However, much of this statistic may be made up of parking, so to speak, where people have no alternative.<\/p><p>  We have very late vocational choice in Ireland, which is unusual in the European context.  That includes vocational choices in higher education.  We have an extremely sophisticated and effective framework in vocational education training as per the national framework of qualifications.  However, that is not necessarily mirrored in the cohesion of the vocational and education and training system.  For example, we have a very small apprenticeship system and vocational education has a very low status relative to higher education and secondary education.  In this regard we are quite different to many other European countries.  <\/p><p>  There are major issues to do with pathways for young people.  In countries where the youth guarantee scheme has been effective they tend to have stronger vocational pathways and greater clarity in the structures.  The German system is quite determinative but our system is virtually open choice and <i>laissez-faire<\/i>.  Where there are not strong vocational pathways one needs to place a greater emphasis on guidance.  In Ireland one could set out on one page a set of guidance measures.  There is virtually no cohesion across the board and a very wide range of guidance issues.<\/p><p>  Reference was made in the earlier presentation to the issue of disadvantage.  I endorse everything Mr. Dooley said.  However, when one talks to employers, there are other issues related to education and training which are very pertinent in the context of a youth guarantee system.  I refer, for example, to the mismatch issue.  Employers will say that they are not encountering people with the required qualifications.  People are coming out of education with qualifications but these are not the qualifications which employers want.  In other words, an employer advertises a job vacancy for which many applications are received but these applications do not match up to the job being advertised.  We are not producing an appropriate balance of intermediate skills.  Employers in the call centre sector, in the hotels and catering sector, the hospitality sector or in retail, will say that they are not encountering people with the skills they require.  The jobs are available but they cannot be filled.  Very often, employers have to import talent, so to speak.<\/p><p>  We may also be producing large numbers of people with qualifications in ICT but employers will say that the particular qualifications are not the ones required by employers.  We have many web designers but we do not need that many web designers; we need people with other IT skills. <\/p><p>  Migration is an issue.  Non-Irish people are emigrating and at the same time people are coming into the country.  We have an immigration and emigration scenario.  The research has found that some of those who are emigrating have jobs and they are moving to other jurisdictions.  I refer to a study by Mary Gilmartin in Maynooth.  Her view is that it is too early to draw absolute conclusions.  We may actually be seeing an extended form of the gap year migration.  It may be that instead of staying in Ireland in a low status job, young people are travelling the world and they may still return.<\/p><p>  I will focus on a couple of issues to do with the youth guarantee scheme.  Is it a quick fix for the current crisis or a trigger for systematic change?  In my view it should be the trigger for system change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Stokes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  This is an important debate.  I am compiling a report on the youth guarantee for the committee and everything our guests are saying will feed into that.  If, therefore, I ask very specific questions, they will know why.<\/p><p>  The areas on which I wish to comment are: the practical and operational details of the youth guarantee; the successes and failures which have occurred in other states and the lessons we can learn from these; funding; and the level of roll-out required in this State.  Having considered the research material, I have discovered that the failure of youth guarantee programmes in other states came down the public policies that were pursued.  I refer in this regard to the public employment service infrastructure.  Are our guests of the view that public employment structures in Ireland are both up to standard and fit for purpose in the context of trying to deal with the youth guarantee?  How will these structures need to adapt?  Will additional funding be required?  Who will assess the success of the public employment structures into the future?  Will our guests indicate how the roll-out of the youth guarantee can be monitored effectively - in the context of job creation and placement services - to ensure it will be of good quality and will not merely be a tick-the-box exercise?  Do the public employment services have the capacity to deliver on the guarantee and to monitor the various matters relating to it?<\/p><p>  Mr. Doorley referred to youth unemployment figures and indicated that he is considering these in the context of young people who were educated to primary level and junior certificate level and those in disadvantaged groups.  He indicated that failures occurred in Sweden and Finland in terms of successfully targeting disadvantaged groups.  Will he inform the committee with regard to how we might reach out to young people who are far removed from the labour market at present or who do not traditionally come on the radar of the public employment services?  Mr. Doorley referred to a role for youth organisations in that regard.  The Council recommendation on the youth guarantee states that we should define the corresponding starting point to deliver the youth guarantee for young people.  Do youth organisations constitute an alternative starting point to the public employment services and, if so, how does Mr. Doorley believe they might deliver in areas in respect of which those services fail?<\/p><p>  Mr. Higgins referred to public employment services and the funding thereof.  He indicated that even if there were matching funding for the &euro;6 billion included under the youth employment initiative, this would be insufficient in the context of trying to deal with youth unemployment on a European level.  How should this matter be addressed?  There is a danger it could just be a flash in the pan and that people will say: \"We are going to deal with youth unemployment and we will make some money available but we will not provide matching funds.\"  How can we ensure the guarantee will not essentially be a damp squib?  From where might we attract matching funding?  What kind of financial commitment should the Government make to roll out what is envisaged?  What schemes should it roll out as part of its initiative in this regard?<\/p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I am very interested in the practical and operational details.  If, however, our guests have views on particular failures relating to the schemes rolled out in other states and what we might learn from these, I would appreciate hearing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100006#E00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Senator Kathryn Reilly, in welcoming our guests and I thank them for their presentations.<\/p><p>  I wish to begin by making a general point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100006#E00300","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363877400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Bernard J.

This is probably the most important presentation we have heard in recent times because youth unemployment is an important and sensitive issue.  Youth are impressed by what they see around them.  In terms of a determination of what is likely to happen and what has happened, they have a short perception of history.  Montgomery said in the 1950s that in 1939 Britain was capable of fighting the First World War.  In 1993 or 1994 we were capable of dealing with the unemployment problem in this country that we had inherited from the 1980s.  That was the sad part about it and Mr. Stokes is a fitting example.  I do not say he lost the hair on his head for that reason, but my hair changed colour in the intervening period.  It is amazing the lessons we learn over a huge period.  We saw in the early 1990s that graduates came from other European countries, both from within the European Union and outside, to seek job opportunities in this country.  They worked at any job that was available.  They worked as waiters and waitresses, although they were laden with degrees.  It was embarrassing at the time and they were ideally placed to fill positions that became available.  We discovered during the 1980s that we had to deal with the problem on the basis of applying sticking plasters.  One assessed and tried to deal with issues one by one and moved on to the next group that was coming on-stream to address the matter from the point of view of the person who was unemployed and had few prospects.  The changes that have taken place in meeting market requirements in terms of job skills are hugely important.  All of us have tabled questions on the issue in recent years and it is clear that there was a disconnect somewhere along the line.  In order to meet the requirements of the market there should be some relationship with the education system to find out what is required and how to plan accordingly.  That is what we must do.  I accept that the delegates are doing this and I congratulate them on it.<\/p><p>  We also had another important issue to face.  During the late 1990s and 2000s a huge number of young people with great expectations, ability and capabilities were in the education system which, unfortunately, they left early.  They went into the marketplace to fill jobs in areas where there was a big demand at the time.  Huge salaries were available to people with relatively few qualifications and people were attracted to them.  How could one say to a young person that he or she should stay in education for another three or four years and that there would be a nice job for him or her or that there was the prospect of a job at a fairly attractive salary?  We must ask ourselves what are the options.  To my mind, the options are stark and simple.  We must, first, encourage young people to move in the direction which is in their long-term interests.  Two colleagues referred to outreach schemes.  That is a conduit we must explore to a greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100007#F00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363878000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Along with Deputy Durkan I could talk all day on this topic because it is complex.  I welcome the three witnesses who are specialists in the field.  Unfortunately, they are posing as many questions to us as we wish to pose to them.<\/p><p>  The &euro;6 billion from the European Union is more than welcome.  I presume it would be over the five year period of the budget and internationally targeted throughout.  I understand it will probably be broken down even within wealthier countries to targeted areas of disadvantage.  <\/p><p>  A major problem in this country is the class and structural divide between the early school leavers and the social housing dependent groups.  I want to ask about the type of structures we should be putting in place.  When I first got involved in the community sector I almost had to learn a new language but even in terms of targeting people into employment, we currently have JobBridge, community employment, T&uacute;s, the JobsPlus initiative and the Momentum programme.  I do not know at this stage whether the CERT training programme still exists.  That was a training programme for people in the catering industry.  We also have SOLAS as a new structure.<\/p><p>  My particular interest is in the statistics the witnesses presented to the committee, particularly about targeting the long-term unemployed.  The long-term unemployed, in the main, tend to be early school leavers but I understand this European youth guarantee only comes into play for those between the ages of 18 and 24.  To talk geographically, I represent Dublin South Central and I can tell the witnesses that one can read the statistics about the degrees of disadvantage in Dublin 10 and Dublin 8.  The disadvantage is comparable in terms of early school leavers, social housing schemes, all the inner city flat complexes.  In terms of Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, there is a large number of statistics to prove disadvantage.<\/p><p>  Do we need a number of new structures to target people?  Somebody mentioned the need to involve the community and voluntary sector.  Those of us who know the area well will be aware of the EU urban programme attached to Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot, of which I was a big fan.  That programme transformed Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot.  It was a successful, targeted programme to uplift a community not by way of employment, but by way of the provision of services from cr&egrave;ches to preschool facilities, parks, leisure centres and so on.  Do the witnesses believe there is any validity in arguing that specific structures be put in place within regions of Dublin, for example, targeting a particular structure in Dublin 8 and Dublin 10 for a particular coterie of people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100008#G00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1363878000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Deputy, could you move your telephone away from the microphone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100008#G00300","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1363878000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Is my telephone on?

I am not as familiar with all the other programmes as I am with Youthreach, as a former CDVEC employee.

We surveyed young jobseekers two or three years ago and asked them about their experience in engaging with F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection.  Generally, jobseekers understood the system was under a lot of pressure and that the numbers had increased a lot in recent years.  Generally, apart from one or two good examples, there was a sense that jobseekers did not receive the sort of engagement they needed.  Jobseekers just felt they were given information at a hatch five or six times without getting the expected support.  The new Intreo model represents an effort to have greater engagement, but this requires many more people on the front line engaging with jobseekers, especially young jobseekers because many of them do not have work experience.  They are in a different set of circumstances.  It is really important that their needs be addressed.<\/p><p>  Many young jobseekers take jobseeking very seriously because they feel that if they make the wrong choice in regard to a training course or work experience, it could be detrimental to their careers.  They regard engagement with the service as similar to a job interview and are disappointed if they are just given five minutes.  I have heard some really dispiriting examples.  Just last week, we had consultation with youth workers who are working with the category of young people in question.  People in the public employment services are working under great pressure and have considerable workloads and many are doing great work, but in some cases young people get a very negative reaction from staff.  They may feel demeaned and this does not really help to encourage them to engage.<\/p><p>  We need independent monitoring of the youth guarantee in Ireland.  We will need to know whether it is working and we need the involvement of the young people who are using the system.  The latter is vital.  There is not enough external evaluation of public employment services.<\/p><p>  One must put oneself into the shoes of disadvantaged young people.  Many young people might have had a very bad experience of the education system.  The level of trust of young people in the system is quite low, as stated by Deputy Durkan.  They get the letter in the post from the F&Aacute;S office and automatically assume it contains bad news.  Many of our member organisations and youth workers have credibility and a track record.  We are not saying they comprise the total solution but that people working with disadvantaged young people have a role to play.  We are not training providers and we are not offering an employment service but many of our member organisations could serve as a bridge to the young people who will not go to a training centre.  Many young people in the category in question have actually been thrown off training courses because they are not prepared.  They might have had difficulties and started with an addiction problem, as said by Deputy Durkan, and may not have the supports necessary to help them.  It is a question of support to keep them on track.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy O'Reilly's question on whether the rate is lower, emigration is obviously a factor.  The number staying in education and training is also a factor.  There is a growing category of young people who do not qualify for social welfare benefits.  They are living at home with their parents and might be just over the threshold so do not see the point of signing on.  Mr. Stokes might have said that if the live register is to become a gateway for the youth guarantee, we will have a problem.  This is because there will be a category of young people who are not signing on and who will not come under the guarantee under the current model.<\/p><p>  I agree on apprenticeships.  The number of apprenticeships dropped from 8,000 per year to 1,000 per year because of the crash in the construction sector.  Apprenticeships are a real alternative for many young people who may not want to be web designers.  They may want a trade or skill and we need to do more about this.  I recently encountered a scheme in Drogheda that offers funding to do up old local authority houses that have been neglected.  The scheme uses young people to renovate houses over eight or nine months.<\/p><p>  Under the payment-by-results model in the United Kingdom, as I understand it, the Government involved the private sector and offered to pay a certain sum if 70% or 80% of 10,000 unemployed people, for example, were moved on within a certain period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363879200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doorley.

While one must take a long-term view of all these measures, one can start in the understanding that one will not finish it very quickly.  I was handed the brief for Youthreach in 1988 and it took the guts of two decades to move from the point at which there was nothing to something that was able to stand alongside other things.  Consequently, one must take a long-term view, even though one must act very quickly and one can do both.<\/p><p>  As for the local structures, one item afoot under the proposals in respect of education and training boards and so on is an attempt to establish local structures that will be responsive.  There is a risk that this could be instrumental and would lose the developmental functions, for example, that VECs traditionally have fulfilled.  However, if one takes into account the education and training boards that are coming into play, the local development companies and partnerships, as well as the new structures in the context of the local authority reforms and realignment, it may not be a matter of establishing new entities at local level.  However, as Mr. Doorley also mentioned, local action is extremely important.  This is because there are variations right across the board and whatever national framework policies are introduced they must be capable of interpretation at the local level in flexible ways that are tailored to working.<\/p><p>  In respect of the payments for results issue, the critical point pertains to cherry-picking.  If several hundred young people are looking for a place, if one has 20 places available and placing them all in employment is a condition of getting all of one's funding, inevitably one will select those who are most employable and cherry-pick.  That was a major problem with some of the F&Aacute;S programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the youth skills programme.  When one comes to monitoring their effectiveness, one actually winds up monitoring the \"in person\" factors rather than the \"in training\" factors, if members understand my point.  In other words, what looks very effective when one considers the results may actually not pertain to the effectiveness of either the training or the action but to the people one has selected to participate.  This is a significant issue.<\/p><p>  On apprenticeships, I wish to make two points.  First, I refer to those areas where numbers declined in, for example, traditional apprenticeship areas.  Incidentally, we have a very narrow apprenticeship system in Ireland.  However, with regard to such areas, in the past we have made use of mechanisms such as, for example, the community youth training programme that F&Aacute;S used to run.  One still sees signs around the country that houses, buildings or old heritage sites were renovated.  In many instances, they were temporary employment mechanisms that allowed people to continue on the path of apprenticeship during a period of low employment or a period in which employers were not able to take them on board.  F&Aacute;S also had a linked work experience programme, which was another useful mechanism.  Consequently, the models are available to maintain the apprenticeship line, but it also is the case that there is an increasing interest internationally; one can see it here in initiatives such as JobBridge, in what might be described as apprenticeship-style measures that focus on using the workplace, linking the training and the workplace and putting the individual in a work environment.  There are many benefits to so doing, but perhaps it is at a higher level and might be described as a professional apprenticeship model.  That also would surmount a comment which frequently is made by many employers to the effect that many young people are ill-prepared for work when they are employed.  I have heard it from small employers and very youth-friendly employers, as well as people who had no particular bias one way or the other and it is a consistent comment from small, medium and large employers.  Some of this pertains to expectations, perhaps as a hangover from the Celtic tiger period, when people expected to walk straight into a job which paid well.  There are many possible explanations for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013032100010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Stokes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363879800,"counter":701,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank all three of our guests for their input.

Its mission statement is to lead the effort to improve the outcomes for children and young people in Ireland.  Therefore, by its nature, the Department has a cross-departmental focus and remit.  I will outline some of the key areas that might be of interest to the committee with regard to what we are doing to tackle child poverty.  The Department is currently developing a high-level national policy framework for children and young people from birth to the age of 25.  This is expected to include inputs from all relevant Departments and to be approved by the Government later this year.  It will be supported by three detailed strategies which will focus on specific and overlapping age cohorts: children in the early years from birth to the age of six, children from birth to the age of 18 and young people from the age of 12 to the age of 25.  This reflects the different emphases at different stages of young people's lives and the key transitional points between each stage.  It is intended to have a single implementation plan which will be monitored and reported on to the Government over the lifetime of the three strategies from 2013 to 2018.<\/p><p>  The issue of child poverty will be addressed by the Department through its policy framework by linking in with key Departments such as the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills, both of which are represented at today's meeting.  In addition, the Department oversees a number of policy areas and forms of service provision which help to address the cycle of poverty.  I will speak briefly about them in a moment.  Early childhood care and education is provided through the free preschool year programme.  Subsidised child care is provided to low-income parents.  The Department is responsible for the National Educational Welfare Board and for youth work programmes.  It encourages inter-agency work and implements prevention and early intervention programmes in areas of high disadvantage to break the cycle of poverty.  This has the effect of encouraging more effective service provision at national level in the longer term.  The free preschool year and early childhood care and education programme was introduced in January 2010 as a universal free programme to provide equal access to early education for all children, particularly the most disadvantaged who might otherwise not attend preschool.  It has a take-up of 95% and currently costs &euro;175 million per annum.  It is availed of by approximately 66,000 children at the moment.<\/p><p>  The Department implements two child care schemes which subsidise child care places for low-income parents.  First, the community child care subvention scheme is operated through approximately 900 community child care services.  Some 25,000 children receive subsidised child care under the scheme.  The weekly subsidy - &euro;95 for full day care - is paid to such services in respect of parents who are in receipt of social welfare payments such as family income support and who also have medical cards.  A lower subsidy of &euro;50 per week is paid to services in respect of parents who have medical or GP visit cards.  The community child care subvention scheme costs approximately &euro;50 million per annum.  Second, the child care education and training scheme subsidises child care places in approximately 1,450 community and privately operated child care services.  This scheme is open to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and students who are required to contribute up to &euro;25 per week for a full day care place.  Some 2,500 full-time equivalent places are available at any time under the scheme.  It is estimated that this equates to some 8,000 students and trainees benefitting from the provision of places each year.  Obviously, not everybody needs a full day care place, or a place for the full year.  The child care education and training scheme costs approximately &euro;20 million per annum.<\/p><p>  The Department is responsible for the National Educational Welfare Board, which is due to become part of the new child and family support agency when it is established later this year.  The board is responsible for supporting regular school attendance and advising and assisting schools, children and parents in cases of attendance or behavioural issues.  The board works with between 8,000 and 10,000 children and families each year.  Some &euro;9 million is being provided to it in 2013.  The board implements the educational welfare service and is responsible for the school completion programme, which supports 124 projects in 472 primary and 225 post-primary schools, most of which are linked to the DEIS programme.  The aim of the programme is to keep young people in formal education until they have completed the senior cycle or equivalent and to improve the quality of their educational participation and attainment.  Each project under the programme is tailored locally.  The projects provide in-school, after-school and holiday-time interventions to approximately 38,000 targeted children and young people throughout the country who are at risk of leaving school early.  This year's provision for the school completion programme is &euro;26.5 million.<\/p><p>  The third area for which the National Educational Welfare Board is responsible is the home school community liaison scheme, which is a school-based preventative strategy that targets children and young people who are at risk.  As the 408 co-ordinators under the scheme are seconded teachers, their staffing costs are borne by the Department of Education and Skills.  They work with parents, teachers and local voluntary and statutory groups to tackle issues that impinge on learning.  Rather than providing support directly to children, they tend to favour more indirect forms of support.  The National Educational Welfare Board is working to integrate the three services I have mentioned under the \"one child, one team, one plan\" model.  It is intended to bring the three services together as a single seamless service for children, young people and families.  The unified service will record assessments of need, provide intervention plans and take inputs into those plans from all three services.<\/p><p>  The Department also has a significant youth work programme, which supports the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and development opportunities to young people, thereby allowing them to enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.  Some &euro;53 million is available for these universal and targeted schemes this year, of which &euro;40 million is targeted at more disadvantaged youth.  Youth work programmes and services are delivered to some 400,000 young people by approximately 1,400 youth workers.  We also have a volunteer base of approximately 40,000.  The Department also funds the development of youth cafes, of which there are approximately 75 across the country.  These successful interventions are provided to young people in an alcohol-free environment.  Another major concern of the Department is to promote inter-agency working at local level.  To date, we have established children's services committees in 16 counties.  These committees are important because they bring statutory and non-statutory service providers in local areas together to adopt a co-ordinated approach to their planning and delivery.  This results in more effective service delivery as well as being more cost-effective.  The work that has been done to date is being consolidated this year by the Department.  We intend to standardise the process and, subject to Government approval, roll out children's services committees as a national system from next year.<\/p><p>  In budget 2013, the Government announced two initiatives to support children and families that are being implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The first of these involves an area-based response to child poverty.  It has been given funding of &euro;2.5 million this year, to increase to approximately &euro;5 million in each of the subsequent years up to 2016.  The initiative has been developed jointly by the Department and the T&aacute;naiste's office.  It continues and builds on work that was previously done by a previous initiative of the office of the Minister for children, which has been delivered in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies since 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363859100,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. John Bohan, principal officer in the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363859100,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss with my colleagues from other Departments the important issue of how best to address the State's efforts to tackle childhood poverty.  I understand the joint committee first invited the relevant Departments with a role in children and youth affairs that are best placed to contribute to a cross-departmental strategy on childhood poverty and that it seeks an update on the work being done in this area by the relevant Departments.<\/p><p>  I will first comment on the general role of the Department of Social Protection.  According to its statement of strategy, the mission of the Department is to promote active participation in society.  It does this mainly through providing a range of income support and other payments and through the provision of employment services such as job assistance, job search and other supports aimed at allowing persons to improve their living standards and life chances.  The Department administers more than 70 separate schemes and services which impact on the lives of almost every citizen.  Expenditure in 2013 is expected to be in the region of &euro;20 billion.  These payments play a key role in supporting those most in need, including children and their parents, persons who are unemployed or sick, carers, people with disabilities and older people.  Specific roles provided by the Department include the development of social protection and social inclusion policy; promoting and supporting the incorporation of anti-poverty and social inclusion objectives in policy development; monitoring the implementation of these strategies; administration of a wide range of social insurance and social assistance schemes for children, persons of working age, carers, persons with disabilities and pensioners; and activation, employment and community services and programmes to promote development, progression, participation and social involvement of our clients.<\/p><p>  These payments and functions set the context for considering the Department's specific role in tackling childhood poverty.  The most obvious role is to pay benefits to families with children, with specific supports directed at such families.  While the best known of these supports is the child benefit payment, there are also a number of other payments such as increases for qualified children to the main adult weekly payments, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection only yesterday held a meeting with the chair of the advisory group on tax and social welfare on the issue of payments to families with children.  The meeting was held to discuss the group's recently published report on child and family income support payments.<\/p><p>  An increasingly important role for the Department is the activation of parents and the provision of assistance to allow them to take up employment.  While this is a long-standing objective of the social welfare system, the recent merger of the Department with the employment services of F&Aacute;S and the community welfare services of the Health Service Executive has had major implications for this role and the future potential of the Department in addressing parental and child poverty through employment and measures to improve parental employability.  The Department also has a role in monitoring its national action for social inclusion, in particular the Government's target to reduce the number of people in poverty.  Following a review by the Department last year, the Government set a new poverty target and announced its intention to introduce a specific sub-target for children to refocus efforts on this issue.  Practical discussions on how to implement this decision are under way with interested stakeholders. <\/p><p>  The Department does not work alone in this area and participates in a number of interdepartmental bodies, including the national children's strategy implementation group led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Through this work, it seeks to participate in a joined-up way in tackling issues of child poverty.  The Department also represents Ireland on international bodies involved in social policy, notably the Social Protection Committee of the European Union, which played a major role in drafting the Council of Ministers conclusions on preventing and tackling child poverty and social inclusion and promoting children and well-being, which were published in October 2012.  The Department is also co-ordinating the preparation of Council conclusions on the European Commission's recently published social investment package.  One element of the package was the Commission recommendation in the area of investing in children.  I will be pleased to elaborate on any of the issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1363859100,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bohan for making the effort to attend the meeting as I am aware he attended the meeting held yesterday to which he referred.

Members will have noted the links in this area from the presentations made by my colleagues, particularly that of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills has a strong focus on tackling educational disadvantage and social inclusion generally.  I will speak about the DEIS programme, which is the central plank of the Department's policy in this area.  While some of those present who have a background in the education sector or in working with children will be familiar with the programme, it is useful to give some context to the later discussion.  DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools: An Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, is the policy instrument of the Department of Education and Skills for addressing educational disadvantage.  Since its introduction in 2006, DEIS has focused on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool through to second level education.  Its frame of reference is based on the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act 1998, according to which educational disadvantage involves the \"impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools\".  These impediments are complex and multifaceted and are underpinned by a range of factors, which includes family poverty.<\/p><p>  Research carried out by the Educational Research Centre prior to the introduction of DEIS found strong evidence that the disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect when large numbers of pupils in a school are from a similar disadvantaged background.  This is known as the social context effect.  In recognition of this, DEIS included a standardised system for identifying schools on the basis of their relative levels of disadvantage and prioritised supports in schools serving the most disadvantaged children and young people.  The objective of DEIS is clear; it provides supports to schools to combat the underlying cause of educational disadvantage, in other words, to level the playing pitch in order that young people have an opportunity to derive maximum personal benefit from the education system.  Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS.  Interventions include a concentration on literacy and numeracy from an early stage, strong links between home, school and community, strong links between schools working co-operatively together and added value from links between education and other services working with children and families.<\/p><p>  A key focus of current policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged and marginalised groups.  Therefore, the additional resources available in DEIS schools should be used to achieve good outcomes for those children who are identified as the most at risk of not achieving their potential through education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitriona O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363859700,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100006#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1363859700,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms O'Mara, Mr. Bohan and Ms O'Brien and thank them for their contributions.  I probably reflect the situation for most of us when I say that we did not have prior sight of the contributions that they were going to make, which normally help us to concentrate and prepare for our discussion.  I am winging it here in terms of what has been said, but there are some broader points I would like to make in the context of tackling child poverty.<\/p><p>  It is great that we have representatives from the three Departments here together.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a new Department and I am hugely enthusiastic about it and believe it will, given the fullness of time, prove its worth.  Mr. Bohan is the unfortunate holder of the responsibility for the Department of Social Protection here today.  Many of our concerns are reflected in that area, particularly due to the austerity programme and the cuts and impacts of it for our respective constituents.  I acknowledge there have tremendous improvements in regard to the Department of Education and Skills and that there have been some important initiatives in terms of improving the circumstances in which children are educated.  There is much yet to be done and I have no doubt all of our witnesses are more than cognisant of everything I have said.<\/p><p>  In my view, there is one glaring omission here, the HSE.  As things stand, despite Ms O'Mara having alluded to the advent of the child and family support agency, for at least this year the responsibility rests within the HSE.   For the time being, the Family Support Agency continues under the aegis of the HSE, but it is not represented here.  However, while the representatives of the three Departments are here, I would like to say that I feel that while they are here together, they are not always acting together in the interest of children.  There is not sufficient evidence to give me confidence or certainty that there is real joined-up thinking across Departments <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>  the consequences of decisions made and matters being implemented.  They need to move from this point to a greater level of relationship with regard to the impact of decisions made.  This would give me great hope.<\/p><p>  We have a population of just over 1 million people under 18 years of age, which puts into context what we are talking about here.  Child poverty is a huge area and it represents itself in many ways, as we have all mentioned here time after time.  We have real poverty, relative poverty and many other indicators of situations where children are left out.  They may not be viewed by many in their immediate communities as being in poverty or threatened by poverty, but the impact of being left out of opportunity and of having the doors of opportunity closed to them has adverse effects on these young people preparing for adult life.  I accept this view is shared across all political views in this committee.<\/p><p>  It is very difficult to focus on what we can do other than encourage the joined-up thinking approach.  Like the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. we are very anxious to see the child and family support agency established and to see the various pieces of legislation, which I expect will have a very positive bearing on the situation regarding children, passed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100006#E00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363860300,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100007#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860300,"counter":728,"content":"<p>-----which means that young people will again be suffering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100007#F00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860300,"counter":729,"content":"<p>The Deputy is straying now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100007#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860300,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Straying?

Deputy Conway's initiative is very welcome.<\/p><p>  I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's final point about the Department of Health.  The delegates are not in a position to answer the question but that Department does have a direct role in dealing with the issue of child poverty.  I support what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said.  The committee found out - if that is the appropriate term - about who is responsible for child and family services.  The public perception is that Gordon Jeyes is the person responsible, but in fact it is Tony O'Brien who has delegated the responsibility within the HSE to Brian Kirwan.  That is the current position until the new agency is established.  I believe more information about who is responsible should be in the public domain.<\/p><p>  I welcome the establishment of the new agency and I also welcome the high-level national policy framework, which is long awaited.  I look forward to seeing it.  Ms Moira O'Mara said it would be available at the end of this year.  I ask Ms O'Mara to assure us that the Department of Health is co-operating in the development of that policy along with the other Departments in attendance today.<\/p><p>  The policy framework will be particularly important in an examination of the issue of child poverty across all age groups.  The early years are very important but, equally, we have seen how the issue of teenage poverty continues into adult life and sets a life path for a young person.  We must remember to include teenagers in our examination of child poverty because a person is a child up to the age of 18 years.<\/p><p>  I welcome the free universal preschool year, although I acknowledge it is only three hours a day for 38 weeks of the year.  It is a relatively short period of time.  I have been talking to providers dealing with certain categories of children such as special needs children.  Recently I visited the direct provision centre in Athlone where the free preschool year is being provided to children of asylum-seekers.  It is a very small provision for children who need to be integrated and included in society.  I suggest that this category of children be considered in any plans to expand the service.  The universal preschool year is provided as part of the plan for helping working parents and is based on sound educational models.<\/p><p>  The model for funding of after-school care was referred to by Ms O'Mara.  I ask her to outline whether there will be guidance on what constitutes after-school care.  From my observations around the country, there are different interpretations.  I am afraid that an <i>ad hoc<\/i> system may develop and in some instances it may be interpreted simply as keeping children occupied, while there may be a planned programme of activities in place in other centres.<\/p><p>  DEIS is an important initiative.  Will there be a linkage between the experience of DEIS and the policy of an area-based response to child poverty?  Ms O'Brien raised some very important issues about learning from DEIS.  Can the information about DEIS be used in the policy of area-based responses?<\/p><p>   It is important, when looking at the new areas and the current areas, that whatever policy is funded should be mainstreamed and replicated in other areas.  Is it a case of having to wait for the pot of money to come to an area?  What is needed are clear programmes that can be adapted and are flexible, but that address issues such as rural isolation and care for certain categories of children who are particularly isolated and vulnerable.<\/p><p>  Access to third level is an issue that hit home to me when I visited the centre in Athlone.  Children in such centres are literally on the edge of a cliff because the supports are not available to them once they finish the leaving certificate.  The programme stops for them at that stage.  I think back to my leaving certificate and the incentives I had to work hard.  I knew that my parents would encourage me to go to third level and that they would provide for that.  However, if one knows there will be no support, that incentive to do well and to go further in education or training or employment is not present.  Those linkages are vital and they should be an important element of the national policy framework for those aged 12 to 25 years.<\/p><p>  On the issue of child benefit, I will not repeat what I said during a very good debate in the Seanad on the advisory group report.  Mr. Bohan attended in the Visitors' Gallery for that debate.  Part of my frustration with the system is that very often each Department can only look for solutions within itself rather than looking for solutions through connections with other Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100007#F00700","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363860900,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning and sharing with us the kind of work that is taking place in their Departments.  The first thing that strikes me in the context of the reading I have done on this area and the evidence we have heard thus far is that everybody is talking about interdepartmental and inter-agency working, but from what I have heard, seen and experienced this is hard to achieve.  What is being done to address that?  People have alluded to the fact that there are no representatives present from Department of Health but I would equally say why are there no representatives present from local government, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is serious about getting people back to work, I point out that women account for 50% of the population and they are often engaged in child minding activities.  They have a vested interest in the provision of child care services and in the provision of and access to funding in order that people and not only the Department of Social Protection can provide that kind of access and support for people.  Local government has a responsibility for the housing provision, the services that are available in communities<i> vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>  libraries and the literacy strategies that we want to implement not only in schools but across communities.  What is at issue is that kind of a shake-up.  We can equally talk about justice and juvenile justice and prevention programmes that work very well in many communities throughout the country.  Some of them now fall under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but they, equally, are stakeholders in this approach to tackling and eradicating childhood poverty and providing people with equality of opportunity.<\/p><p>  The witness from the Department of Children and Youth affairs spoke about the work and the money that has been focused and funnelled on this area.  I would like to know how are the outcomes in this respect being measured.  The witness spoke about the large number of people who are involved in youth work but have we any indication that what they are doing is making any difference?  I am not saying that in a flippant way.  Often people do things with the best will in the world but in this respect I am not sure we are getting the value for money that the children, the families and the State deserve.  People are well-intentioned and do good work but sometimes we have to stop and ask if what we are doing is the right thing for this family and for this community.  Equally, I would say that the hardest thing about reform and change is to ask somebody to stop doing what he or she is already doing and to do it in a different way.  That is what is hard about inter-agency work.  In some ways people are being asked to stop doing something or to hand over control.  Each of the witnesses' Departments has gained huge experience and learning from the types of initiatives they have in place but, unfortunately, they are often pilot projects.  A good quote was made at a hearing of the committee last week, namely, that there have been too many pilots projects and not enough mainstreaming.  All the Departments would be guilty of that.  How will we get that learning from all the Departments to show outcomes?  Will outcomes be measured as opposed to blanket cuts being simply imposed?  We know of some youth services that took a great deal of time and effort to devise a programme that would provide the best outcomes for the children in their community rather than simply doing  what they had been doing, yet they were levied with the same cuts as everybody else, even though they could show that there was a marked improvement.  I would like to know from all the Departments if what they are doing is working, how do we know it is working and if something is not working, how can we change it.  That is what we want to try to find out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100008#G00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860900,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today and for their presentations.

As he said, I cannot comment on Government policy regarding the budget and budget measures but I can provide a number of facts which might put the issue into some context.  As Deputy Dowds mentioned, we still have one of the highest rates of income support.  I know there are issues about income support versus services which were mentioned by other members but child benefit remains one of the highest universal payments in Europe, and we can provide statistics on that.  That means when that is combined with selective instruments such as the QCIs, we are still meeting the national anti-poverty strategy target, which is that child income support is to meet 33% of the adult rate.  Under those measures the Government is still meeting the target of approximately &euro;62 per child in disadvantaged households, and that is the amount of resources available.<\/p><p>  There is a major issue regarding the income transfers versus the available supports, but in looking beyond the effects of the immediate measures one should probably examine the existing structural issues.  Evidence produced by our research programme showed that approximately one-quarter of children lived in jobless households, therefore, 50% of children in consistent poverty were in jobless households.  The fact that we had a very high rate of jobless households pre-existed both the boom and the bust in the economy.  That suggests that what needs to be done about child poverty is in the structural area of getting parents back to work, improving supports, and improving levels of activation.  That sets the tone for some of the changes being made in the Department.<\/p><p>  On the system of income support, the advisory group has identified a clear need to examine the area of reform and has put forward its report for consideration, including by this committee's sister committee, the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, and looks forward to hearing the views of that committee.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout and Deputy Dowds made a point about moving beyond the terms of reference of the advisory group.  Yesterday, our chair said that the terms of reference did not allow the group to move beyond income support to the question of whether better value for money would be achieved by moving into child related services.  There is evidence that those countries which put more effort into services get better results in terms of child poverty.  The reason for that is that it addresses the structural factors I just mentioned.<\/p><p>  Deputy Dowds asked if there was any evidence for that.  The Department undertook a value for money review of the child support system published in 2010 in which we produced evidence from different countries which showed where the better results were being obtained, and it correlated with higher levels of spending on services.  There were better outcomes in many other countries but one would have to take that on a case by case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363862100,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I also will go through the points as raised, some of which already have been covered by Ms Moira O'Mara.  I will start with the point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others regarding joined-up working and it is absolutely true.  In a way, at a time when we have less money and fewer staff resources across Departments, we must consider ways of working smarter and doing things better.  One obvious thing to do is to link with other Departments and try to share some of the workload.  Literally, this has happened in respect of the early childhood education space because even before the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established and ever since the days of the Office of the Minister for Children, the early childhood education section of the Department of Education and Skills has been physically located with the Office of the Minister for Children.  That has put them in that kind of different thinking space as well, which is very useful.  Another example is research capacity, because that is where we get the information.  We get the data that give one the evidence on which to base whatever policy decisions one makes.  The Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study is a huge, highly valuable study.  The Department of Education and Skills is participating in that and for a number of years we have taken the view that if researchers are going into homes and schools to ask questions, one should make sure they are asking all the questions they possibly could.  Consequently, we have fed questions into that study which would be of particular value to our Department, even though the research project is located in the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Although the ESRI is heading up that research project with Trinity College, in addition to the overall data bank they publish individual reports all the time, one of which is about to be published on attendance levels in schools.  This actually comes from the Growing Up in Ireland data on foot of the kind of questions we were seeking to have included in it.  This is just an example of Departments thinking together and working just a little bit more smartly to get better outcomes.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also referred to conditions in schools and really it is the idea of rural isolation and the overall position with regard to small schools and so on.  Members probably are aware of the programme of the planning and building unit, that is, the Department's forward planning section.  A couple of things are going on including the amalgamation project or process if one wishes to call it that, the divesting programme and the outcome of the recent value for money review of small schools.  While stuff is going on regarding the schools' physical story, the bigger question concerns equipping the teachers to teach the children in such schools and to deal with the kinds of issues that come up.  In this regard, the focus is on both building up initial teacher training capacity and in the kinds of continuous professional development, CPD, teachers get.  This is because, in common with the rest of the public service, there are fewer teachers and they need to have better capacity to deal, within the school day and in the school building, with the variety of things against which they will come up.<\/p><p>  Another key area that keeps coming up in all of the research we look at concerns parents and parental involvement in schools.  This probably is true most of all in rural communities, where the school is one of the key parts of the local community.  Parental involvement is key and it particularly is the case for certain minority groups, like the Traveler community, ethnic minorities and immigrant communities, that the involvement of parents from those communities is key.  While those issues often are perceived as a problem, in many cases they make school and community life all the richer for their participation.<\/p><p>  On the issue of access to third level, the point to make is that pre-DEIS or in its very early stages, the focus was on progression from primary to post-primary school.  Happily, the focus has shifted from making sure that children progress from primary to post-primary school to giving consideration to ensure they completed the junior cycle.  While that was the focus, happily we now are in the space that the worry, if one likes, concerns our wish to ensure they go to third level.  There is much going on in this regard such as transition year initiatives and the involvement in schools of business and the private sector.  Such entities enter schools or take children into their companies and businesses to show them what working life would be like.  This is an impetus in its own right.<\/p><p>  To mention the G word, that is, the guidance story in schools, although there has been a reduction in this regard, the emphasis, like in everything else, is turning to building up capacity among the overall school team.  In other words, just because one is a geography teacher or a history teacher does not mean one does not have a role in guidance or in the pastoral story in the school.  It really is about teachers encouraging the children in their classes and placing the kind of value they should have on education and on getting further education.  This is difficult and it is difficult for many families who are struggling themselves.  In particular, much of the research shows that in the case of parents who themselves have not progressed past primary level or who do not have second or certainly not third level education, it is difficult for them to put themselves into that space.  However, the emphasis really is on the teaching community and the capacity in schools to put value on progressing.  Moreover, to be fair to the third level colleges, they also do a fair amount of work in this area, as do the student organisations in third level.<\/p><p>  I will talk a little about the learning from DEIS and the prevention and early intervention programme, PEIP.  Deputy Conway asked about the link between them and the difficulty in a number of the projects that have been implemented to date has been that they did operate in parallel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitriona O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363862700,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Could I ask Mr. Bohan who is going to the workshop?

Every time one does any research into literacy, parental involvement is mentioned.  All too often, however, I hear from parents' groups that when they bring their child to school they are told by the teacher not to teach children reading because the school has methods for doing that.  Parents may be told to ensure that their children can tie their laces and eat lunch in the allotted time, but we need to embed a culture of bringing parents into the classroom as well.  In that way, parents will not be seen as doing the extras while teachers educate, because education is in all aspects of a child's life.<\/p><p>  Regarding the success of the universal pre-school year, I am delighted that Ms O'Mara is here because she was the architect of that success.  She ensured that it was done in an appropriate way.  We have a high take-up rate and have the names of children in the free pre-school year.  I do not understand why the National Educational Welfare Board, schools or the Department of Education and Skills are not empowered to track those children through primary and secondary school.  The difficulty is that when we examine drop-out rates between primary and secondary school we are looking at numbers.  We are not actually looking at whether the drop-out rate could be attributed to emigration, moving elsewhere within the country or registering in their name as Gaeilge.  The situation is not always clear.  Perhaps some of that data could be used positively to get the evidence - as with the longitudinal study - and thus understand what is happening.  <\/p><p>  I also wish to comment on special needs with regard to the universal pre-school year.  I welcome the earlier comments on seeing how different things work.  To add to the mix, I have heard from early child care providers that the difficulty with some special needs children is that five days a week is too much for them.  Inspectors are saying, however, that if the child does not attend five days per week he or she cannot avail of the scheme.  I can provide evidence of this from different parts of the country.  The early child care providers have said they will spread the attendance over the year for a child in order to ensure they get the scheme, even though five days a week may be too much.  They may need to be eased in gently.  Perhaps we could have some flexibility to ensure that the Department that is funding the scheme gets value, while also ensuring the desired outcomes for children, even if they are not on the roll on a given day.  That issue has arisen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100011#K00600","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1363862700,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their answers so far and for their time.  I would like to go back over some of the answers we got, particularly what Mr. Bohan said about 50% of children living in jobless households and the structural issues involved.  What involvement, if any, does the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have concerning child poverty?  What involvement has the Department of Justice and Equality had, given that we know the importance of investing in children?  Although we have not had such a study here yet, all the longitudinal studies in America and the United Kingdom show the benefits involved.<\/p><p>  This is particularly the case with the HighScope pre-school programme where an intervention is given to children aged three to five.  The study followed those children into their 40s and 50s, and showed that their peers - particularly those from disadvantaged communities - who did not get the intervention, often ended up incarcerated.  This is a preventative measure, so the Department of Justice and Equality should have an interest in this area, particularly if we can invest in children from disadvantaged communities.<\/p><p>  Some years ago, I had an opportunity to visit Penn State University to work on a project.  This involved working with children who were living in chronic disadvantage.  That kind of early intervention programme was being delivered by teachers in the local community, in partnership with parents who were being encouraged to become involved in literacy programmes and improve their own literacy.  It had a two-fold effect.  It showed that the children who did not attend were 50% more likely to end up in trouble with the law.  It is a very real point. <\/p><p>  In fairness to the witnesses, they are probably like the usual suspects when it comes to discussing child poverty.  We invite in representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but what are other Departments doing in this regard?  If they are not doing anything, what can we do to get them involved?  This issue needs to be dealt with in a cross-departmental manner, rather than just involving the usual suspects.<\/p><p>  I know that the sex education programme is still being designed.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment on the rural issue when it comes to registered child-minders.  They should be considered for providing an after-school service in rural areas.  Large areas of the country have no child care facilities, so a parent may have to drive 20 miles to drop their child to a centre so they can attend work or retraining.  City and county child care committees all over the country have invested huge resources to upskill child-minders who are in a position to mind sibling groups, or drop and collect children from school and elsewhere.  They constitute a major resource so we should examine the provision of child care by such people, rather than focusing only on the provision of child care at designated centres.  <\/p><p>  In Australia and elsewhere abroad, they call it home-based child care or day care.  We should examine that because this group of people wants to provide such a service and wants to be regulated.  I have had major interactions with them in recent months on this issue, which would be a cost-effective way of providing after-school child care all over the country and not just in urban centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100011#K00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363863300,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Senator van Turnhout asked about the ECCE database.

It is involved on our children services committees in the 16 counties where we have them.  It works with local players there in terms of youth diversion.  At the moment it focuses down as far as youth and they try to divert children from 12 or 13 years of age.  I agree on the need for early interventions which is where our Department's perspective arises in terms of working with parents.  We actually work with parents of prenatal children as well as young children.  As well as working with early years, the new initiative will work up to 18 years, so we do not want to cut off at that point.<\/p><p>  We do not have a regulatory system that is appropriate for child minders - only 600 people have notified the HSE.

We need to regulate the child care sector better.  I understand the HSE is moving to a registration system which should be operational by the end of this year.  That will be a first step in moving from notification to registration.  Then we hope to bring in regulations and move to the next step.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked about having a proper programme of activities for the new school age sector, which is also unregulated.

I wish to make a correction to the statistic she quoted.  I realise it is very difficult to discuss statistics on this area.  I said that a quarter of children were in jobless households.  That has meant that 50% of children in poverty are in jobless households.  It is just a different way of presenting the same statistics.  I offer to send the committee our jobless household studies so members can see some of the basic statistics there.<\/p><p>  I am loth to comment on the roles of other Departments, so I will say something general and something specific.  Generally the Government's strategy on poverty is based on the premise that all aspects of Government policy have an impact on poverty because poverty is multidimensional.  Given that it is so multidimensional it is incumbent on every Department to examine its proposals and schemes to ensure it is having a positive impact on poverty.  We remind them whenever a social-impact assessment or poverty-impact assessment is to be undertaken.  As part of the implementation of the review of the national poverty target, we are hoping to strengthen that role in the whole process.  That is the general point.<\/p><p>  Specifically, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 attributes a number of actions to individual Departments.  There are certainly some actions attributed to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which used to be the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Some of those have migrated with the F&Aacute;S services to our Department, so my answer is somewhat complex.  I can send the committee the list of actions from the national action plan, which will give members an idea of the specific actions the Government has asked those Departments to take on poverty.  We update those actions regularly and we tend to complete it in time for the social inclusion forum.  After that we might send the committee that list and members can get an idea. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100012#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363863300,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I will respond to Senator van Turnhout's comment about the parent being told not to teach their child.  It is very easy for us to talk because we are not busy and frazzled teachers in classrooms.  However, the Constitution provides that parents are the primary educators of children.  What the Senator was discussing is the kind of thing that has come up in some of the DEIS-related PEIP programmes.  Of course maths is now taught completely differently from how it was when I was at school.  Parents are a resource.  In particular, parents of children in DEIS schools want to be a resource but often do not have the capacity and are nervous about making the approach in the first place.  In a number of cases there is an after-school programme - a school-completion programme - where there is either a numeracy or a literacy initiative or both.  The parents are involved in that and the programme is explained to them.  There is almost a parents' pack so they fully understand what is being taught and how.  They can then do their bit at home.<\/p><p>  There is a good outcome for children but the spin-off effect has been that parents have found a renewed interest in education for themselves, as they want to be able to follow their children up through the school system.  In some cases parents have physically come back into the school building, which is a major achievement for parents who might have had bad experiences in school themselves.  They find themselves back in the school atmosphere and have gone back to education themselves.  Parents, some of whom barely completed primary school, are now back doing their junior certificate examinations at the same time as their children, which is very encouraging, although not enough of it is happening.  One would expect that schools and teachers should see parents as a resource but often a certain amount of work needs to be done to equip them to become that resource.  It is a challenge for teachers who have fewer resources and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013032100012#L01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitriona O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863300,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and making their presentations.

Together with my colleague from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, we hope to be able to address for the committee the issues and concerns that arise for Ireland in considering this legislative proposal.<\/p><p>  This proposed directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure was published at the end of January.  To provide some background to the development of this proposal, the European Commission's March 2011 White Paper, the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area, called for a reduction in the dependence that transport places on oil supply and set targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 60% by 2050.  In the White Paper, the Commission announced it would develop \"a sustainable alternative fuels strategy, including the appropriate infrastructure\" and provide \"guidelines and standards for refuelling infrastructures\".<\/p><p>  Concerned by the slow attainment of alternative fuels infrastructure across the EU, the Commission considers that, along with the lack of common technical standards, this represents a major obstacle to the market introduction of alternative fuels.  It has, therefore, developed a proposal for a directive which aims to deliver a build-up of alternative fuels infrastructure conforming to common technical standards so as to facilitate a quicker transition to cleaner transport.<\/p><p>  The proposal contains mandatory requirements for the extent and coverage of alternative fuels infrastructure for transport and also common technical standards for their construction and interoperability.  The main alternative fuel options that could replace oil as the primary fuel source for both road and maritime transport are identified as electricity, hydrogen, bio-fuels and natural gas in the forms of compressed natural gas, CNG, liquefied natural gas, LNG, or gas-to-liquid, GTL, and liquefied petroleum gas, LPG.<\/p><p>  The draft directive would require member states to adopt and publish national policy frameworks for the market development of electric, hydrogen, bio-fuels and natural gas refuelling infrastructure.  Member states would be required to co-operate with one another, either through consultations or joint policy frameworks, to ensure measures would be coherent and co-ordinated.<\/p><p>  To assess fully the implications of these proposals for both transport and energy infrastructure investment, consultations within our two Departments and with key stakeholders have commenced or more will be undertaken shortly.  However, based on our initial assessment of the proposals, the Irish Government position could be summarised as follows.  In matters such as common standards, action at an EU level will be required to ensure market harmonisation and acceptance of refuelling equipment by users across the EU and, therefore, the technical common standards should be supported.  It is also the case that strong action will be necessary if Ireland and the EU are to achieve overall greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.  This proposal will set minimum requirements for alternative fuels infrastructure across the EU and it is likely that EU-wide targets such as this would give increased reassurance to car manufacturers and investors in making the long-term investment required to speed up the shift to lower emission vehicles.<\/p><p>  Mindful of the need to ensure measures are proportionate and cost-effective, however, the role of national policymakers in setting targets within individual member states needs to be considered further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363860000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Behan for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032100003#B00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>Is it true that no bus operator in the State uses alternative fuels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032100003#B00300","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363860000,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I believe a gas-fuelled bus was operated by Dublin Bus on a pilot basis for a few years, but I do not believe it worked out technically.

It is true.  The Commission has set out targets in a directive on the basis of its impact assessment.  It conducted an analysis of our plans for electric vehicles, EVs, and examined the levels of urbanisation and vehicle ownership.  Some people consider the targets to be fairly steep, particularly in terms of the EV refuelling infrastructure.  The target for compressed natural gas is less onerous at one per 150 km.  Only time will tell whether the targets are overly optimistic in terms of take-up.  There are seven years between now and 2020 and there may be a high take-up of electric vehicles in the intervening seven years.<\/p><p>  Most member states have identified that setting targets now for unknown fleet numbers in 2020 is something that we may need to bear in mind when negotiating the directive.  For example, a review clause may need to be inserted for three years down the line to determine whether the targets are feasible in light of developments in the intervening period.  The nature of the targets will be a matter for negotiation.  Listening to the transport Ministers around the table, we are not alone in believing that we may need to reconsider the targets to make them non-binding if infrastructure is not being developed quickly enough to meet the level of vehicles in the market or to insert a review mechanism to determine whether the targets are still appropriate a few years down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032100004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1363860600,"counter":803,"content":"<p>I do not want to disagree with Ms Behan, but the Department is operating in a vacuum.

The thrust of the Commission's approach in proposing these reforms is that there is enormous scope to drive greater efficiency in the provision of rail services and this is the basis on which rail can regain market share and stem the decline to which it has been subject for quite a long period.  With regard to tendering specifically, in the material the Commission states significant efficiencies are to be gained through mandatory tendering and gives examples in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands in particular of savings in state expenditure on public service contracts of approximately 20% to 30%.  In its background analysis and impact assessment, the Commission has presented evidence that mandatory tendering drives efficiencies in the railway business.<\/p><p>  I take the point made by the Deputy on the potential benefits of these reforms being reduced somewhat by virtue of the fact that Ireland is an island which does not have a rail link to the Community rail network.  It is clear the major benefits to be obtained from these reforms will arise on the European mainland where there is a very extensive network and there are major opportunities to develop new services.  The potential benefits are somewhat reduced for an isolated small network.  I do not believe this means there are no benefits to be gained.  The background to our decision to bring our derogation to an end was that there are benefits to be gained from the application of the European model.<\/p><p>  With regard to access to rolling stock, very high fixed costs are associated with the infrastructure of the railway business and with the rolling stock.  Accessing the market is only possible where new entrants are able to readily access rolling stock.  In markets with more developed competitive structures, such as the UK, leasing companies exist from which railway rolling stock can be obtained by new entrants and competitors.  This issue must be addressed in other member states where such structures do not exist.  With regard to ownership of the rolling stock in Ireland, some of it is owned by Irish Rail.  Some of the rolling stock which has been procured using Exchequer funds in recent years has been subject to a condition that ownership can revert to the State, although I cannot put specific figures on the proportion of the rolling stock to which these provisions apply.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's final point on safeguards was more a comment than a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032100007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Towey"},{"type":"speech","time":1363862400,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I would like to ask some follow-up questions.
