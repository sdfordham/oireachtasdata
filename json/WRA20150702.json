This view has been upheld in a recent Equality Tribunal hearing on this very subject in relation to a civil partnership.<\/p>  <p>  The public service operates a Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme.\u00a0 This provides benefits to Spouses or Children of deceased members.  In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one-half of the former member's pension is payable.\u00a0 Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension of one-third of the spouse's pension for each of the first three eligible children.<\/p>  <p>  The original pre-1984 scheme, which was optional,\u00a0did not allow for the payment of a pension to a spouse who married or had children post retirement.\u00a0 Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the individual had not been married up to the point of retirement. <\/p>  <p>  In 1984, a revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses who married or had children after retirement was introduced and membership was\u00a0compulsory for all new appointees after that date.  Members of the original scheme, certain retirees and those who had not joined the original scheme\u00a0were given the option of transferring to the revised Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the Revised Scheme was that the spouse of a post retirement marriage was eligible for a spouse's pension.  The disadvantage of the Scheme was that there was no facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the individual concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For members who remained in the original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.\u00a0 Many members of the scheme availed of this option and received a refund.<\/p>  <p>  Across the entire public service, approximately 30,000 staff who were not members and an unquantified number who had been members of the original scheme opted not to join the new scheme.\u00a0 Their reasons for doing so were presumably varied, including not\u00a0expecting to get married, being in a relationship with a separated person\u00a0who was not then able to\u00a0divorce\u00a0or that it was personally more beneficial to them not to join the scheme.\u00a0\u00a0For example, prior to 1984 women were not required to join the pension scheme and pay contributions; some of those in the older scheme may have decided that continuing that arrangement was\u00a0better financially for them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, some individuals have sought to reverse the decision they made at that point and have sought a new opt-in.  More specifically, a number of people have argued that they could not have envisaged that same-sex civil partnerships would be legalised in the state. <\/p>  <p>  A fundamental element of any new opt-in would have to be that it would have be open to all applicants regardless of their reasons for not opting-in in the first place.\u00a0 This would be required so as to avoid alternative claims of discrimination.\u00a0 Every then serving and retired public servant who opted to remain in the old scheme or chose not to join\u00a0either scheme would have to be given the opportunity to opt into the new scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Public service spouses' and children's schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.\u00a0 Given the passage of time since 1984 and the greater clarity those who opted out then will now have about their lives, it is eminently foreseeable that only those persons whose partners would benefit would opt in.\u00a0 This would radically undermine the group insurance basis of the scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This Department's position has always been that if decisions freely made about pensions or other matters could be reversed at any time this would have grave consequences for public administration.\u00a0 Where changes have been made to pension schemes, individuals have only been allowed to opt in to the new arrangements at the time of the introduction of the new scheme.\u00a0 This approach is in line with that of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200078#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Implementation","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200078#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[26381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200078#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the criteria his Department utilises to anticipate and prepare for future human resource trends in the public service, including how the need to respond to imbalances in staffing resources per capita across different geographical regions is measured and how this data is incorporated into policy; what he considers to be, based on available data projections for demographical trends, the most pressing concerns to the ability of the public service, including in particular local government; if he will provide an effective and generally equal service to all citizens in the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Councils have heretofore discharged their responsibility through the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee.   <\/p>  <p>  The most recent formal report submitted by the Committee to the Office of Public Works (OPW) shows that it expended almost &euro;142,000 in 2011.  This expenditure comprised routine maintenance works including the cleaning of drains and river bed, cutting back trees or other obstructions, weed control and, where possible, improving water flow.  The OPW has been advised  that the Committee has since expended &euro;136,000 in 2012, &euro;149,310 in 2013 and &euro;150,891 in 2014 on further maintenance works. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the River Suck Joint Drainage Committee was disbanded with effect from 1st January, 2015 on foot of Ministerial Order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, as I have indicated, the ongoing maintenance of the channel and the funding of that work remains the joint responsibility of Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council. <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of its Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme in 2009, the OPW has provided significant funding under the scheme to Galway and Roscommon County Councils to enable them to undertake flood alleviation projects identified by the Councils within the River Suck catchment to address localised flood problems.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, nearly &euro;2.1 million has been approved to Galway County Council and over &euro;550,000 to Roscommon County Council for minor flood projects within this catchment.  Details of all the projects for which funding has been approved to local authorities under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the  River Suck area, as part of the larger River Shannon Basin, is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon Basin. Draft predictive flood maps are currently being produced by engineering consultants undertaking the Shannon CFRAM Study, on behalf of the OPW, in partnership with the relevant local authorities.  Public consultation days in relation to the draft flood maps for the study areas were held earlier this year and I am pleased to say that these were generally well attended.  National consultation on the flood maps is to take place in late summer\/early autumn of this year, following which the flood maps will be finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The next phase in the CFRAM Study will then be the identification of appropriate flood risk management options for each significant risk area, following which Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) are scheduled to be prepared in late 2015\/early 2016.  The draft FRMPs will then be the subject of public consultation before being finalised. Updates on the study are available on the Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The FRMPs, when finalised following a public consultation process, will provide the basis for decisions regarding future investment by the State in flood risk management in significant risk areas, including those in the River Suck catchment area.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time.

Over 10,000 new tenancies have been processed since the start of the year, showing that landlords are accommodating persons under the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord.  The Department must verify the existence of a valid tenancy before a claim can be processed.  Where all the necessary information is available every effort is made to ensure that rent supplement claims are processed as quickly as possible.  It should be noted that under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for new applicants with long-term housing needs transfers from this Department to the local authorities. HAP is now being rolled out in 13 local authority areas with further roll-out scheduled later in the year.  I have no plans to amend the conditions of the rent supplement scheme at this time.<\/p>  <p>  As previously advised to the Deputy, rent supplement, administered under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), is a statutory means-tested scheme which is payable at differentiated rates of payment, taking into account the applicant&rsquo;s means and accommodation requirements.  All income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property (other than the home) and capital are assessable as means.  This includes means derived from a cash settlement following separation, including that in lieu of the family home.  In the case of rent supplement, the person living in the family home would not qualify for the scheme as their accommodation needs are being met. <\/p>  <p>  The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200079#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200079#WRB03150"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[26690\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200079#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total social welfare payment currently being received by persons (details supplied) in County Carlow; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>Up to 15 April 2015, this client was in receipt of a One-Parent Family Payment of &euro;247.60 per week.

For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency. The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment. The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.  <\/p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance and community employment.

A major problem facing governments was that\u00a0authorities simply did not have the tools to manage their failure in an orderly manner. <\/p><p>To address this problem the European Commission proposed a common EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of banks facing difficulties.  This piece of legislation, known as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) is currently being transposed by Member States.  A key priority of the BRRD is to separate banks from the sovereign and ensure they are allowed to fail with minimal disruption to the financial system and without reliance on taxpayer funds.<\/p><p>There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:  <\/p><p><b>- <\/b>Preparatory and preventative measures including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions; <\/p><p>- Early intervention measures which would include supervisory powers and implementing recovery plans; <\/p><p>- Resolution tools including appointing a special manager, sale of business, bridge bank, asset separation tools and the use of bail-in mechanisms.<\/p><p>The bail-in provisions\u00a0are key as they will enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail.  This is an important means of ensuring that a bank s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers.  Where bail-in is not sufficient to cover a bank's losses additional funding can be accessed via a resolution fund. Resolution funds are financed by means of contributions from a Member State's\u00a0banking sector, and\u00a0will be built up over a number of years. <\/p><p>For Member States such as Ireland that are part of the banking union a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) will become operational from 1 January 2016 and will be\u00a0backed by a Single Resolution Fund (SRF).  This fund will replace the national BRRD resolution fund, and\u00a0 has\u00a0 a target level of 1% of covered deposits of all participating Member States to be reached within eight years (approx.&euro;55 billion).\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>It is acknowledged however that in the early years of the SRM, situations may arise where the SRF is not sufficiently funded by the banking sector to face a particular resolution action.  Consequently it was agreed by Eurogroup and Ecofin Ministers in December 2013\u00a0that there was a need to put in place a system by which bridge financing would be available as a last resort. It was agreed that\u00a0 during the transition period, bridge financing will be available from national resources, backed by bank levies or from the ESM in line with agreed procedures.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <\/p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the  Group threshold  below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. <\/p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these were last changed in Budget and Finance Act 2013 when they were reduced by 10% to their current levels with effect from 6 December 2012: <\/p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child. <\/p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. <\/p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, <\/b>applies in all other cases. <\/p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  It should also be noted that the thresholds apply on an individual basis so that, for example, where there are two children the current Group A threshold of &euro;225,000 applies individually to each child in respect of gifts and inheritances from their parents. <\/p><p>I have said in response to a number of other recent Parliamentary Questions on this matter that I recognise that the recent growth in property values has implications for the liabilities that can arise from CAT. For this reason, I am reviewing the various aspects of this tax, including the lifetime tax-free thresholds, in the context of my preparations for Budget 2016 and the subsequent Finance Bill.  <\/p><p>I would, however, refer the Deputy to the existence of the CAT dwelling house exemption, which allows for a property to be gifted or inherited tax free when the beneficiary is already living in the home.  While certain restrictions and conditions apply to ensure its proper use, this exemption is designed to prevent cases of hardship or displacement for individuals who are home sharers and carers.  In cases where the dwelling house exemption applies, the tax-free thresholds are unaffected and continue to apply separately and are available to an individual to cover the value of other gifts or inheritances which he or she may benefit from over their lifetime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200082#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Loans","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200082#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[26778\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200082#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of loan facility letters issued in respect of existing loans whereby changes were made to the terms and conditions of the loan by the former Anglo Irish Bank for each month from August 2008 to December 2008 and from 1 January 2009 until 21 January 2009, the date the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 became law; if he will specify the nature of any changes to the loan agreements executed during this time; if he will specify the nature of the approval process in place at the bank at this time for any such changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department\u00a0have advised the Deputy that the information requested in this parliamentary question is not held by my Department and that the process of retrieving and collating the information\u00a0would be undertaken by the Special Liquidators of IBRC. <\/p>  <p>  Given that the loan facility letters are not held in electronic format, the Special Liquidators have advised my officials\u00a0that the retrieval of this information would be a manual process which they estimate\u00a0would take 6-8 weeks to complete at a minimum cost of &euro;40,000. <\/p>  <p>  Before instructing the Special Liquidators to commence the process of retrieving and collating the information requested, officials in my Department thought it prudent to contact\u00a0the\u00a0Deputy advising him of the\u00a0timeframe and cost associated with answering this parliamentary question.

As a designated person, NAMA is required to have procedures for the assessment and management of risks of money laundering or terrorist financing, based on a methodology proportionate in its detail and complexity to the size and nature of the business and the inherent risks of money laundering or terrorist financing.  NAMA has such procedures in place.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that when undertaking loans sales, which is a distinct activity from that of lending, NAMA conducts Anti-Money Laundering due diligence checks on a best practice basis in order to mitigate reputational risk. In all such transactions, NAMA is particularly interested in establishing the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners. Where such transactions include UK persons\/entities, NAMA may make enquiries through the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), as appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  Where property sales are conducted by debtors, notwithstanding the funds from such a sale may ultimately be used to repay NAMA debt, NAMA is not a party to the property transaction. The relevant Anti-Money Laundering checks are conducted by the parties to the transaction, that is, the solicitors involved in the transaction and the financial institutions through which the funds may flow, as designated persons in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that in this case the transaction was notified and cleared by SOCA in the UK as the purchaser was a PEP (politically exposed person).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200083#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200083#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[26996\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200083#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the expenses incurred by him between 2011 and to date in 2015, to include the date, expense type, description and amount;

The purpose of the revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers based on up-to-date rental values.  Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between the rental value of a property and the commercial rates liability which applies to that property.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the national revaluation programme, the Valuation Office published a new valuation list for the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area on 31 December 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, provides that the commercial rates income of a local authority is capped in the year following revaluation, limiting the reasons for any increase in total local authority income from rates to the following: Inflation; Extensions to existing properties; and New properties coming on stream.  As a result, the revaluation of\u00a0commercial properties in a local authority area is essentially a revenue neutral exercise concerned with the redistribution of the rates liability between ratepayers by reference to the net annual value of the commercial property they occupy. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, and the shift in relative values of various property types and uses between the late 1980's and the valuation date of 1 March 2012, some 65% of ratepayers in the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area have had a reduction in their rates liability while 35% have had an increase.  This is more or less in line with the outcome in other recently revalued rating authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The trend of change in liability occurred across a range of property uses and is not confined to the categories of property to which the Deputy refers.  The question of the Commissioner adopting a different approach to the valuation of certain categories of property which receive public support does not arise as all valuations determined by the Valuation Office in all sectors are carried out solely in accordance with the valuation principles prescribed by section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001.  Government policy in relation to support of the areas mentioned does not play any part in the determination of values under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is not a new policy and is being carried out under legislation enacted in 2001.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his function under the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015 and the carrying out of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.  I would not be aware of the values emerging for different sectors before the final valuation list is published and the legislation provides for an extensive appeals process.  The carrying out of a Regulatory Impact Assessment does not therefore arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00400"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[26705\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of requests for meetings he has received from private, external, non-State-funded lobby groups; the number of meetings he has held with these groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in view of the range of my remit as Minister I receive representations, including requests for meetings from a broad range of sources, including members of the Oireachtas, local and voluntary groups and private individuals and companies.<\/p>  <p>  While my Office does not maintain a register of all such requests for meetings or invitations received, I can advise the Deputy that during 2014 I have attended some 150 meetings with a variety of individuals and groups, including some 18 meetings or so with representatives of those bodies under the aegis of my Department and other public representatives.\u00a0 These figures would not include informal unscheduled meetings that might arise from time to time.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has recently been enacted by the Oireachtas and will commence on 1 September 2015.\u00a0 The Act provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission (the Standards Commission) will establish and maintain an online register of lobbying and oversee compliance with the legislative provisions.\u00a0 The purpose of the register will be to make information available to the public on the identity of those communicating with designated public officials.\u00a0 Persons lobbying will have to register with the Standards Commission and will be required to submit returns on their lobbying activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Calculations","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00700"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[26729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200084#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to recent representations from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, if he will consider the introduction of a rates system based on trading data; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The levying of rates on commercial property by reference to turnover or profit rather than net annual value\/rental value would be a significant change and a departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates by reference to property values.\u00a0 There are already taxes in place which are levied on business turnover\/profit, i.e. VAT and income\/corporation taxes.<\/p>  <p>  The basis of rateable valuation for all rateable property is Net Annual Value as set out in Section 48 of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015.  Net Annual Value is the rent for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with well-established valuation principles and case law, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV\/rental value) of a building.  The most common methodology used is the comparative method, which as the name implies, makes direct comparisons with other similar buildings in the same rating area.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value a method of valuation known as the Receipts and Expenditure method of valuation, where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the Net Annual Value of the property, may be used.  This method of valuation or a variation on this method is frequently used in the valuation of licensed property for rating purposes.

The Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) in the RDP will benefit sheep farmers and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.  Knowledge Transfer Groups will also be run for sheep farmers, continuing and building upon the progress made to date under the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP).

","asker":"1069","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 143 to 146, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The inspection report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on the child and welfare services in Louth Meath describes serious concerns regarding the standard of services being provided to children and families in the area. Tusla had notified me on the problems in the services prior to the publication of HIQA&rsquo;s report and has taken direct ownership of actions to improve the standards of service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  I can report that Tusla has intervened in the area immediately and that actions to improve management, oversight and quality assurance are well underway. They are being led directly at a senior level by the Chief Operations Officer. Additionally, a project social work team is being put in place to deal with the backlog and to assist with the implementation of national guidance and practice for the duration of the special programme.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla submitted an action plan to HIQA to address the recommendations following the inspection and this has been accepted.  On the most serious findings, Tusla has completed 22 out of the 46 actions, with the remaining 24 to be completed within dedicated time frames.  Of particular importance were the steps taken to ensure all children on the Child Protection Notification System had an allocated social worker and that improvements were made to record keeping and data collection.  Progress will be monitored by HIQA and officials in my Department to ensure these are completed.<\/p>  <p>  Issues were highlighted around resources and staffing in Louth Meath. This is being addressed at national level as a matter of urgency. Officials from my Department have already been engaging with Tusla on resources for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. A submission on staffing and other resource issues is to be made in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised that at the end of 2014, there were 1,451 open cases in the Louth Meath area, of which 620 were waiting on the allocation of a social worker. A key issue is the management of cases identified as needing a social worker while they are waiting. HIQA found the Louth Meath system to be poor and rated it as a significant risk. The management of the open cases is now being addressed and new systems have been put in place to review, monitor and manage cases waiting the allocation of a social worker in the Louth Meath area. Improvements to the recording of risks are also being made. A systematic approach piloted successfully at local level is being extended to the whole Louth Meath area.  Prioritisation of cases is not solely related to the risk involved and this will continue to be recorded separately.  Tusla is engaged in a review at national level on the system of prioritisation and how the recording of risk can be better reported.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to adults of concern in the community, senior managers at local level will undertake the task of reviewing the relevant information, with particular attention to any children that may be currently at risk.  Cases where there is an immediate risk are acted on without delay within the Duty Social Work team.  Otherwise, the cases will be risk rated and prioritised.  Where alternative resources are identified as a need, this is to be escalated to the Principal Social Worker in the first instance, and if necessary to the Area Manager.  In addition each county has in place a sex offenders risk management group.  This group is to assess the risks associated with convicted adults in the community.<\/p>  <p>  I do not consider the standard that was found in Louth Meath to be acceptable but I am encouraged by the positive and rapid response by Tusla in getting to grips with the problems.   It is also important for people to know that the positive aspects of the service were reported as well.  There was evidence of good practice and excellent interagency collaboration.  Good practice with children and families was observed by inspectors, who also found that many neglect cases were well managed by social workers and children's lives had improved from social work and family support intervention.  The majority of initial assessments were of good quality, based on detailed information from key sources and including the clearly expressed views of children.  Many children were found to have benefitted from the service.<\/p>  <p>  I have arranged to have regular meetings with Tusla senior management to monitor the significant progress required in this service area. The inspection report indicates that a number of the reforms in the national organisation of the overall service were in evidence.  I am determined that these reforms will continue to make improvements to the consistency of positive outcomes for children and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02350"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[26695\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of requests for meetings he has received from private, external, non-State funded lobby groups; the number of meetings he has held with these groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>The information is in the table. <table><tr><th>Number of Meeting Requests<\/th><th>Number of Meetings held with Minister<\/th><th>Number of Meetings held with Officials of Department<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02550"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[26715\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200088#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps he will take to protect funding for the 600 For&oacute;ige youth clubs which engage in a range of projects and programmes; if he will continue to ring-fence the funding these services require; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

The HPRA, in cooperation with the Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other international regulatory and law enforcement agencies, actively monitors the online movements and supply of prescription and illicit medicines to Ireland. The HPRA uses a range of enforcement powers to tackle this activity including seizing product and taking prosecutions. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2015, following coverage in the British press of the death of a young woman that was linked to Dinitrophenol (DNP), a warning was issued by the HPRA highlighting to consumers the dangers of taking slimming products purchased online. DNP is a highly toxic substance not fit for human consumption, which can cause serious harm and death.  Subsequently, following the death of a young Irish man suspected of having taken the same product, another warning was issued by the HPRA in June.  <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA&rsquo;s enforcement officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are liaising regarding their respective investigations into the supply of the DNP product and the events surrounding this recent death.  They continue to work together to monitor and investigate instances of supply of illegal medicines via the internet. <\/p>  <p>  On July 1 the EU logo signifying the legitimacy of websites of pharmacies and medicines retailers was introduced in order to place controls upon, and reduce the significant health risk posed by, falsified medicines. Members of the public are strongly urged not to purchase medicines from an internet site which does not have the EU internet logo. In Ireland these controls apply to pharmacies\/retailers involved in the internet supply of non-prescription medicines. The internet supply of prescription medicines continues to remain prohibited in Ireland on grounds of public health protection.<\/p>  <p>  I would reiterate the advice of the HPRA and recommend against the purchase of any prescription, or unauthorised medicines online. Further information can be found in the HPRA&rsquo;s leaflet, &ldquo;The Dangers of Buying Prescription Medicines Online&rdquo;.  For those already in possession of such products, consumers who feel any ill effects from taking any products purchased online should contact their doctor immediately.

Delays in processing nurse registration applications are directly connected to the volume of requests arising from the current initiatives to attract and retain nurses in the Irish health services.  The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention. <\/p>  <p>  The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice.  According to the NMBI the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. <\/p>  <p>  The main difficulty to expediting timely applications, as reported by the NMBI, is that of delay or failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment.  A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service.  If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration. <\/p>  <p>  The NMBI is processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that officials of the Department met with the President and the Chief Executive Officer of the NMBI last week to discuss a range of operational issues including the current delays in Registration.  A further meeting between the Department of Health, HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland is scheduled for this week.

Talks are ongoing between the US and Cuba with a view to the normalisation of relations between the countries, and I believe that these are advancing in a promising manner. On 1 July the reopening of bilateral embassies was announced by the US and by Cuba. The US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by the US Congress and President Obama has indicated his willingness to engage with Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo, which we welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the US embargo are long-standing and clear and were set out in the United Nations on 28 October last year in our support for the relevant resolution at the UN General Assembly. We are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of Cuba&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people. The recent UN debate also recorded continued concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development. Together with our EU partners we have urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Congress in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population. I urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements in all areas mentioned, and to grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.<\/p>  <p>  At the April Foreign Affairs Council, EU Foreign Ministers agreed to continue to support the ongoing reforms in Cuba and are working on the negotiation of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Cuba. Ministers also welcomed the restoration of relations between the US and Cuba, and I made it clear in my intervention that Ireland sees the removal of Cuba from the US government&rsquo;s state sponsors of terrorism list and the lifting of the embargo as vital steps to facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.<\/p>  <p>  The historic developments of recent months have seen considerable progress in US-Cuba relations. We look forward to the ending of the embargo with the removal of all remaining inhibitions to trade and contact with Cuba. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200093#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200093#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[26804\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200093#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if information is regularly updated to advise Irish persons on safety concerns while visiting certain countries; if such information is widely circulated to the travel industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>Travel advice for individual countries worldwide, including the level of caution recommended, is publicly available to individuals and travel companies on the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>This advice is published in order to make useful information available to assist Irish citizens in making well informed decisions when planning their trips and when travelling.<\/p><p>Through our network of Embassies, the Department closely monitors developments in countries to which they are accredited and consults with local actors in country and other EU and international partners to draw up the most appropriate travel advice and security status.

Delay on the part of parents in applying for an exemption on behalf of their child should not by itself cause the application to fail where otherwise the child's circumstances fully meet the criteria for an exemption.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is currently finalising a review of its exemptions policy at primary and post-primary levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200094#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childhood Obesity","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200095#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[26832\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200095#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding childhood obesity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.  In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions. The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).

car test model for cars, to combat the extremely high level of sub-standard housing being rented on the private market in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply. With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.<\/p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). <\/p><p>Since the establishment of the PRTB, over &euro;30 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation. Over 167,000 inspections have been carried out in this period. Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.<\/p><p>In relation to the level of sub-standard housing being rented on the private market in Dublin, the high rate of non-compliance found as a result of inspections by Dublin City Council and reported on recently, reflects the fact that the inspection effort is targeted at the very properties most likely to be in breach of the standards. A Red C survey undertaken last year as part of the DKM report for the PRTB found that less than 10% of tenants surveyed were dissatisfied with the condition of the property.<\/p><p>The idea of certification has been proposed before and there is merit in the proposal. A 2014 report from DKM Economic Consultants, &lsquo;<i>The Future of the Private Rented Sector&rsquo;<\/i>(commissioned by the PRTB), put forward a number of options in relation to improving the quality of the rental stock. These include:<\/p><p>- improving the enforcement of standards by local authorities by prioritising those properties more likely to be in breach of the required standards, and<\/p><p>- in time, moving to a model where there would be a responsibility on the landlord to produce a certificate of compliance every three years.<\/p><p>In the short term it is my intention to promote best practice in implementing the regulations across the local authorities. The possibility of shared services across local authority areas is also to be explored. The regulations will be reviewed this year and the potential role of certification will be considered as part of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200095#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200095#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[26711\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200095#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding enhanced redundancy for persons (details supplied) in County Mayo following discussions on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1074","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>My Department has no role in the internal operations of any private organisations and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage.
