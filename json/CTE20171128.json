A rigorous assessment, as in previous years, has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the EU Commission's proposals for the fixing of total allowable catches, TACs, for the coming year.<\/p><p>The European Commission proposal was issued on 7 November and several non-papers updating the proposal have issued since.  The final arrangements for 2018 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 11 and 12 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting following intensive negotiations with member states and the European Commission.<br\/><br\/>The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  Ireland&rsquo;s total allocation of quotas in 2017 amounted to 233,500 tonnes with a total value of &euro;280 million.  There are also valuable inshore species which are not subject to EU TACs, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and are fished by the Irish fleet inside our six-mile coastal zone.<br\/><br\/>The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations such as blue whiting are not included in the proposal as yet.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the coastal State pelagic stocks, the mackerel TAC was agreed in October.  The new quota for Irish fishermen for 2018 will be 69,143 tonnes.  There was new scientific advice this year which showed that, while the stock is in good shape, a precautionary approach for long-term sustainability was necessary with a significant reduction in quota recommended.  Accordingly, following careful consideration of scientific advice of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, and discussions with the Marine Institute and industry stakeholders, I supported a reduction, in line with the agreed long-term management strategy, in the quota for 2018.<br\/><br\/>The blue whiting negotiations will hopefully be concluded in early December.  This agreement involves some transfer of blue whiting to Norway.  I will be seeking to keep that transfer as low as possible.  The EU-Norway negotiations began in Bergen, Norway, yesterday and will last all week.<br\/><br\/>Next year will see the continued phasing-in of the landing obligation or discards ban.  This was a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and agreed by all member states, as well as the European Parliament.  It will, in effect, phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  This is a common-sense goal but the obligation comes with significant challenges.  We must be determined to face these challenges head on, if we are to ensure the sustainability of our vibrant coastal communities which depend on healthy fish stocks.  That is why I have, in co-operation with my colleagues from other member states, requested that the landing obligation and, in particular, the issue of choke species be discussed at the December Council.  There are several challenges that can only be addressed by common action from the Commission and the member states.  I will be pursuing this issue vigorously.<br\/><br\/>One of the key objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is maximum sustainable yield, FMSY.  This is the largest average catch or yield which can continuously be taken from a stock under existing conditions without damaging the future returns from it.  Our shared ultimate objective is to bring and maintain our fish stocks to levels that can deliver FMSY by 2020 at the latest.  However, in line with the Common Fisheries Policy, it is being implemented in a progressive manner and its introduction may only be delayed if a strong case can be made that its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleets involved.<br\/><br\/>The proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  To inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2018.<br\/><br\/>From 7 November, an online web portal on <i>www.fishingnet.ie<\/i>was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  These portals remained open until 22 November and in all four submissions were received by the closing date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the <i>fishingnet.ie<\/i>website.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders, fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs, on 24 November.  The purpose of this meeting was to give a further opportunity to the main stakeholders to outline their positions on the many aspects of this proposal.  Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, I was unable to attend in person but I have been fully appraised by my officials of the views expressed.  I thank all the various stakeholders for their contributions to this impact assessment.<br\/><br\/>As always, there were a range of views among stakeholders.  However, there were also commonalities and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process.  These include a call for adherence to the available scientific advice to enable responsible and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  This however must be balanced with the concern that major cuts to TACs could have severe socio-economic impacts.  In that context, I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied they are absolutely necessary and fully supported by rigorously assessed and clear scientific evidence.  To illustrate what we are facing next week, some of the cuts for some of our important stocks will involve a cut of 62% in herring in the Celtic Sea, 34% for haddock in the Celtic Sea, 59% for whiting in the Celtic Sea and 12% for monkfish in the Celtic Sea.<br\/><br\/>Following the consultation process and the expert advice of the Marine Institute, I do not believe that all these reductions in quota are either justified or necessary.  However, I accept cuts where the scientific advice available to me makes the case for such reductions.  The Marine Institute and BIM have again this year made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before the committee.<br\/><br\/>From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute&rsquo;s view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern, namely, in the areas west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2017 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous years stock books.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks, 29, and percentage, 39%, in 2017 compared with last year.  The percentage, 23%, and number of stocks, 17, overfished have also increased in 2017, whereas the stocks with unknown status declined slightly from 31 to 28 or 42% to 38%.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document which has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute and is available on its website.<br\/><br\/>The socio-economic impact assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals does not fully account for Ireland&rsquo;s share of fishing opportunities.  The current proposals exclude a number of important stocks, mackerel, horse-mackerel and blue whiting, where the final European Union TAC, as well as member states&rsquo; quotas, depend on external, third country, agreements.<br\/><br\/>If agreed as they currently stand, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals would see net reduction in fishing opportunity, quotas of 27% by volume, tonnes, and 12% by value.  In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;17.4 million.  A net reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal sector, whitefish and nephrops, of 21% by volume and 10% by value would have a direct income reduction of &euro;12.9 million.  A net reduction in fishing opportunity for the pelagic sector of 34% by volume and 39% by value would have a direct income reduction of &euro;4.56 million.  This is due mainly to a decrease in boarfish and Celtic Sea herring.<br\/><br\/>For north-west stocks in area 6, there would be a 6% reduction in fishing opportunity, valued at &euro;460,000, for the demersal, whitefish and prawn, fleets.  This will directly impact the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  For the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast, area 7, stocks it is estimated there will be 23% reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal fleet.  This reduction is valued at &euro;10.8 million and will directly impact the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere, and Ros a&rsquo; Mh&iacute;l, as well as other smaller ports.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income is also lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in several ancillary industries, such as net-making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  Based on turnover multipliers from fish landed in distinct Irish ports, BIM estimates the full costs, direct, indirect and induced, of the proposed quota reductions are in the order of &euro;54 million.  This will obviously have a knock-on effect for employment.  BIM further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, these reductions could impact between 200 and 300 full and part-time jobs.<\/p><p>This could occur either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies in the seafood sector.<\/p><p> The proposals do not include the Hague Preferences which are a safety net for the Irish fleet in the case of specific stocks, in respect of which total allowable catches, TACs, are in decline.  Essentially, they are additional quota amounts Ireland and the United Kingdom claim for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quotas comes off their allocations.  Ensuring the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2018 will amount to 2,726 tonnes of fish, with a direct value of &euro;5 million and an associated impact on between 60 and 80 full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.<\/p><p> I fully concur with the findings made in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  It highlights the significant impact the current proposals could have on the fishing industry.  Significant challenges lie ahead in the next two weeks, but I will do my utmost to agree to a fair and balanced package for Ireland that will ensure the continued vibrancy of the fishing industry and the long-term sustainability of stocks.  I thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment and look forward to the debate on the conclusions reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#D00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to take questions on that issue or does he wish to move to the other fisheries related topic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#F00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I can make the opening statement on the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#F00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We will also hear that opening statement.

The long-term implementation of the landing obligation was to be set out in regional multi-annual management plans, MAPs, adopted through co-decision.  However, since it was envisaged that the adoption of MAPs would take some time, the CFP provided for the adoption of discard plans through Commission-delegated acts shaped through joint recommendations of the member states concerned.  These discard plans could last for a period of no more than three years.<\/p> <p>  The first Commission-delegated regulations establishing discard plans entered into force on 1 January 2015 and are expiring at the end of 2017.  After the expiration of the initial three-year period, the CFP only empowers the Commission to adopt very limited delegated acts to implement the landing obligation, since the objective was to have all MAPs in place after three years.  To date, however, only the Baltic multi-annual plan is in place.  Two Commission proposals for multi-annual plans for demersals in the North Sea and small pelagics in the Adriatic are under negotiation between the co-legislators.  A proposal for the north-western waters multi-annual plan which is of greatest concern to Ireland is expected to be published later this year.<\/p> <p>  Against this background, the intention of the proposal amending the basic regulation was to extend the empowerment of the Commission to adopt discard plans for a further total period of up to three years while the remaining MAPs were being negotiated.  The purpose is to allow the regional group of member states' discards plans to have legal effect for a further three years  in order to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation.  For Ireland&rsquo;s pelagic industry the concern was not immediate, but all were conscious of the implications for demersal discard plans which would expire at the end of 2018.  It is demersal fisheries that will require the full use of the flexibilities available under the CFP to try to avoid so-called choke situations where there is insufficient quota to cover catches that must be landed.<\/p> <p>  Member states were only informed in July that the Commission intended to bring forward a proposal for an amendment to Regulation 1380\/2013 to deal with this issue.  My Department had previously raised it with industry representatives at meetings of the sea fisheries liaison group, SFLG, in March and May.  The SFLG is the formal group where either my officials or I meet the representatives of the producer organisations &ndash; the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO; the Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation, IS&amp;WFO; the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, IS&amp;EFPO, and the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO - and the representative organisation for processors, the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, IFPEA, to discuss issues arising.<\/p> <p>  With the announcement of a specific proposal, a more in-depth discussion took place at the SFLG meeting held on 19 July.  At that meeting all representatives agreed that there was a need to allow discard plans to continue and that if that required a change in the regulation, that is what should be done.  The formal proposal was circulated to both industry and NGO stakeholders on 31 August.  Only one response was received and it was supportive of the amendment.  During the discussions that took place at the Council fisheries working party Ireland consequently supported the proposed amendment so as to allow the continuation of discard plans.  The proposal received the full support of the EU Fisheries Council and the European Parliament and the amendment was given legal effect earlier this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#F00500","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will now take questions from Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn who was the first to indicate and he will be followed by Deputy Charlie McConalogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#F00600","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and wish him well in the negotiations.  I wish to make a few points, of which the Minister is probably aware as we had a conversation about this issue at the committee not long ago.  <\/p> <p>  Approximately 1.2 million tonnes of fish are caught annually in Irish waters.  Some 20% of the total catch is allocated to Irish boats, while 80% goes to others from abroad.  Currently, 5% of all fish caught in Irish waters is processed in the State.  Of the 250,000 tonnes caught by Irish vessels, only 50,000 are processed, which is, of course, where the value is added.  These are unbelievable statistics.  Can the Minister imagine the loss the State is facing because of this?  We must have a conversation about it now in the context of Brexit.  The committee heard the presentations made by the fishing organisations which were deeply alarming on the potential impact of Brexit and the denial of access to British waters.  If the removal of access to British waters materialises, as the British Government has indicated will be the case, will the Minister to ensure it will not trigger displacement?  In other words, under no circumstances can the EU boats currently fishing in British waters be transferred to Irish waters as we would be squeezed even further.  Considering the stark realities of the percentage of fish caught by Irish boats in our waters, the tiny percentage processed in the State and the huge potential loss of income, will the Minister give the committee a clear assurance that his objective in the negotiations is that we will not concede any further in the context of Brexit?  We must make it clear now that under no circumstances will the fleets currently operating in British waters be squeezed into Irish waters.  I appreciate that the Minister must negotiate on these matters, but I wish be given an assurance that this will be the objective of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#F00700","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.

I am not as familiar with it as perhaps I ought to be.  <\/p> <p>  Fish processing which could contribute significantly to employment seems to be minimal within the industry.  It is similar to the old argument about the beef industry when many jobs were lost when cattle were exported on the hoof.  Thankfully, that trend has been reversed a little and we are in the peculiar position where if we did not have live exports, the beef industry would not be doing as well.  Is there any correlation with what could happen in the fishing industry?<\/p> <p>  The Minister faces difficult negotiations and takes everybody's best wishes with him in trying to secure the best deal in the context of various external reports and advices with which he must contend regarding reductions that will be foisted on us in our TACs.  To whom will he look for support around the table?  We are able to cultivate support from, say, France and others in the case of the agriculture industry.  Who are our best friends when it comes to the fishing industry?  While many fish are being caught, they are being caught by large trawlers.  What about the small entrepreneurs in the industry?  Where do they fit in?  Surely, because of these proposals they will suffer a significant adverse disproportionate impact.  As Deputy Charlie McConalogue said, the Minister will try to mitigate the impact as best he can - we all wish him well in that regard - but will the harshness of the proposals be visited disproportionately on those who operate small trawlers and boats?

It is almost an existential challenge for the fishing industry because the consequences will be enormous.  The Senator has made reference to the fact that while Irish fishermen catch a proportion of the TAC in Irish waters, fishermen from other countries catch the majority of it.  However, it is interesting in the context of Brexit to consider the volume of fishing endeavour undertaken by the industry in what are deemed to be UK territorial waters.  The advantage in some respects of the CFP is that where we have a quota, fishermen can chase it in other waters also.  Therefore, in that context, there have been swings and roundabouts.  The most important issue is the health of fish stocks, not so much where the line is in the Irish Sea or UK territorial waters because a country's quota allocation determines the entitlement to fish at any given time.  We have a system which is different from that in the United Kingdom in that the quota is a publicly owned resource allocated on the basis of one's track record annually, whereas it is a privatised resource in the United Kingdom.  The most valuable fish stock in Ireland is mackerel.  Approximately 60% of our mackerel is caught in UK territorial waters, while 40% of prawns, our second most valuable stock, is caught there.  That is a major concern for us.<\/p> <p>  If the United Kingdom opts for a hard Brexit and pulls up the drawbridge behind it, stating these are their waters and that no one else can fish them, displacement will be a concern.  However, it is also impacted on by quota availability because nobody is supposed to fish without an allocation and the danger is that more people will look for a share of the available sustainable fish stocks in a smaller pond.  That is the challenge.  We have been working extraordinarily hard with like-minded member states that will be equally adversely impacted on.  It would not serve our purposes well to engage in a solo run.  A shared analysis of what the impact will be for the industry across member states is likely to bring us the best dividend.  I have heard the view expressed that we should use the negotiations to revisit the isssue of relative stability and so on.  They are issues to be considered in a new CFP.  There is a shared analysis among member states, including Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden and Ireland, which is being fed into the Commission to try to make sure our interests are protected in the negotiations.  With regard to relative stability, it is a reasonable position to take that the shares allocated under the CFP will be the legal entitlement of the United Kingdom on leaving.  It is not the territorial area but, legally, the United Kingdom's share of the fish stocks.  I cannot state definitively what the outcome will be, but our best opportunity to secure a good result for the industry which is part of a pan-European industry alliance that has a similar shared analysis to like-minded member states is by sticking together in the negotiations because if we try to fight individually, we will be picked off.  That is what we are trying to do in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Charlie McConalogue raised the issue of the advice given by ICES.  It is the international body that provides scientific advice.  No mistake was made in the Department or the Marine Institute in providing advice on mackerel stocks.  The issue was the collation and interpretation of the scientific data ICES had available.  We subsequently contacted the body.  There was a belief at one stage that ICES might correct the quotas mid-year, but that did not happen.  The correction has been made this year.  While that was disappointing, the industry recognised that this outcome was not unexpected.  For example, Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation is the one impacted on most by the reduction, but there was a realisation that, in the context of the scientific advice available, the outcome achieved was not unreasonable.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose raised the issue of support from other member states at the upcoming Council meeting.  Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned Council meeting on Brexit, at the December Council it tends to be each country for itself to maximise its yield.  There may be occasions when a temporary alliance can be formed in dealing with a particular stock, but my initial and only experience, at last year's Council meeting, was that it was a fast moving, dynamic set of negotiations across a range of species and that one made alliances where one could.  Sometimes one is standing on one's own, but it is primarily driven by the sustainable management of the resource and then trying to get one's maximum share.<\/p><p>We have to bear in mind the critical importance of things like the Hague Preference, for example, a provision that has enabled us to achieve a higher rate when an overall allocation in a species is going down, thereby recognising the importance of that to us.  It is extraordinarily challenging now because, for a number of very important stocks, the science suggests very significant cuts and the impact on employment, both on the high seas and onshore in terms of processing, is significant.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to the level of fish processed here.  What we have been trying to do in recent years, in a co-ordinated way, through investment in our port facilities, is to encourage foreign vessels that are fishing off the south or west coast of Ireland, for argument's sake, instead of steaming back to the north of Spain, France or wherever, to drop into Castletownbere, Killybegs or Rossaveale and have their catch processed there, where they can also re-fuel and obtain all other necessary provisions.  That is an industry that would bring benefit both in terms of onshore processing and the provisioning sector.  We have been reasonably successful to date and I am aware, for example, of a significant industry that has built up around Castletownbere on that basis.  It is the kind of investment we are putting into facilities in Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dingle, where significant dredging works in the harbour are ongoing at the moment.  This gives an opportunity to try to increase processing opportunities and the jobs that go with that to the Republic.  I believe it is more cost-efficient for those boats to land and have their catch processed here, and then have it shipped onwards by ferry to wherever the markets are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#G00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The issue of international transferable quotas arises where corporations that own super-trawlers have been able to buy massive quotas, which impacts on our indigenous fishing industry.  Is this an issue that has come onto the Minister's desk?  Obviously, we have discussed the issue of super-trawlers in this committee and we looked at the challenges of ensuring the catch they report is actually happening, and we looked at the issue of inspectors going on board to monitor this more closely.  There are big concerns about super-trawlers within the fishing industry and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talked about trying to attract more of the foreign trawlers to land here to the benefit of our processing industry and to have that added value.  Is there anything we can do to oblige those trawlers which access Irish waters to land their catch in Irish ports?  I was able to tell the Minister that 1.2 million tonnes of fish are caught in Irish waters.  I assume that, at some point, every one of these trawlers has to report this catch, whether they land in an Irish port, a home port or a port on the neighbouring island.  The Minister might advise us how that reporting is done and how the catch is monitored.  I assume it is all under the jurisdiction of the European Union.  Is there any way we can oblige or encourage them to land their catch here or to directly connect that fishing in Irish waters with Ireland?  We need to do more than just market or encourage this.  If we look at the 5% of overall catch that is processed here, we have do much better than that and we have to get more value out of that for our island.  I would like to get a sense of all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#H00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in.

We need to be very aggressive in ensuring we can make the best case for ourselves.<\/p> <p>  There is information from the IMI and ICES in regard to the impact on stocks of overfishing.  I believe we would all agree this is bad news for everybody in terms of smaller catches and the knock-on effect on jobs.

We want to get to a situation where all species are fished according to this objective and it a road we have been making progress on.  We subscribe in principle to that but we accept that, in certain situations, it cannot be achieved overnight and we need to have a two-step or three-step approach to it.  However, it is getting to a situation where we are only taking from any particular species a level which allows us to come back the next year and also have a harvest.  It is a question of moving stocks to that sustainable management process.  In many respects, it is what is driving the quite considerable proposed reductions here, which, in certain circumstances, would be quite difficult economically for coastal communities to reach in one short swoop.  Our position will be informed in terms of both the survival of fishermen and the survival of fish, and we must have balance in the approach.  We certainly want to, and do, subscribe to the principle but it is a question of getting there over a manageable period.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the international transferable quotas, super-trawlers and so on, the first principle is that no vessel, whether a super-trawler or a small fishing boat, can fish without having a quota to fish those species.  Obviously, it then becomes an issue of policing the effort of every boat.  If we had a situation where our quotas were private assets, we would long ago have had a situation where we would have maybe a dozen or so huge boats and the industry would be wiped out as we know it in very many small communities.  I am glad that is not a road we have gone down.  However, it is equally important that we are able to police those who come in with big quotas and take substantial volumes.  The practice in other countries has been to have private assets and, therefore, to be able to sustain huge boats, rather than having the large number of small and medium size boats that our industry is, in large, characterised by.<\/p> <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is the critical agency and the Naval Service is important in terms of boardings.  For example, in 2016 we had 18 inspections and we have had 30 to date in 2017.  I understand that three German, one Lithuanian, ten Dutch, one Norwegian and three Russian boats were boarded, which is a significant increase in activity over the previous year.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we have been supportive of, in principle, is the idea of further ensuring compliance with quotas through the placing of onboard cameras on these boats.  It is something we have been trying to make progress on in negotiations, although it has not yet been possible to get agreement on it in terms of getting access to real-time information shared by all member states.  I think it would be a logical step forward.<\/p> <p>  There has been increased activity in regard to boardings and the relevant authority, the SFPA, is active in that area.<\/p><p> Obviously, it polices anybody who fishes in our waters, be they our own boats or others.  It is important that the authority has all the necessary instruments and the use of cameras to monitor activity would be another tool in its armoury to be more effective in that area.  I am aware there is a narrative suggesting the big super trawlers are the bad guys and the small community-based fisheries are good guys.  What is important from a policy perspective is to ensure that there is a level playing field for everyone who has a quota - be it a privatised asset in a super trawler coming from the aforementioned states that we have boarded or our own industry - and they are catching what their quota is.  That is how we ensure that stocks remain viable and sustainable in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#H00600","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Can the Minister comment on the issue of landing and boarding at ports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112800002#J00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1511886600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Under the free movement of goods and so on, I do not think we could legally enforce a situation where we would compel a trawler to land because they had caught so much here.  The case we have been making is it is in their economic interest that, rather than steaming all the way back to the north of Spain with their catch, for instance, reprovisioning there and steaming back to catch whatever species they are chasing in Irish waters, they drop into Castletownbere, reprovision there, have the stock processed there and then have it carried to market via Rosslare or Cork Harbour on a roll-on roll-off ferry.  We are increasingly making that pitch for business based on the investment we are putting into piers in these critical areas.  For example, blue whiting is one of those stocks and we have an opportunity to make the business case to Norwegian vessels to come into Killybegs, rather than them going all the way back to a port in Norway.

I am seeking the committee's approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2017 voted allocations, it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.<\/p><p>This technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer savings of &euro;9 million in certain areas of the Vote to fund the Brexit loan scheme I announced in budget 2018.  In addition, I am requesting the committee's agreement to transfer &euro;14.5 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to the agriculture environmental schemes to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to pay 85% advance funding to all farmers who have established their eligibility.  A further &euro;4.5 million will be moved to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme and &euro;6.6 million will be transferred to Bord Bia to assist with ongoing promotional work in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  Finally, a further &euro;14 million will be transferred to the World Food Programme to support its humanitarian work across the world.<\/p><p>The &euro;48.6 million current funds required will be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the context of the administrative budget pay subhead, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the knowledge transfer programme, the animal welfare scheme for sheep, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, seafood development programme, research, the early retirement scheme and the development of agriculture and food.<\/p><p>On the payroll underspend, the savings arise from a lower than estimated pay bill due to recruitment of additional replacement staff not proceeding as quickly as planned.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;12 million in 2017 payroll allocation.<\/p><p>On the &euro;8.2 million in savings in development of agriculture and food, these are primarily due to funding which had been allocated to this subhead of the Department's Vote pending the development of a programme of activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit by Bord Bia.  It is proposed to transfer this to Bord Bia under the Supplementary Estimate.  Other savings are arising because there has been a lower than projected spend on lean reviews by food companies.  In addition, a specialist food producer scheme which is currently in development has yet to be launched.  It is now expected that this will be launched in 2018.<\/p><p>On the animal welfare scheme for sheep and the sum of &euro;8 million, this scheme was launched in December 2016 and is centred on a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe on foot of the flock owner undertaking two animal health-related actions.  The original Vote allocation provided for full payment in respect of all ewes in the national flock.  While a high percentage of sheep farmers are participating, not all potential participants choose to do so.  Year 1 advance payments commenced on schedule in mid-November and some &euro;16 million has issued to more than 20,000 farmers.  Balancing payments will issue in 2018.<\/p><p>On the BDGP and the sum of &euro;3 million, 23,150 farmers are currently participating in BDGP 1<b>.  <\/b>The programme was reopened in 2017.  However, fewer than anticipated numbers applied to participate.  Some applicants were ineligible to participate while others did not comply with the mandatory requirements of BDGP 2.  Ultimately, 1,550 farmers are participating in BDGP 2.  The &euro;3 million reduction in the Estimate for 2017 is attributable to the take-up and the compliance with mandatory requirements relating to BDGP 1 and 2 being less than projected.  Payments in respect of BDGP 1 and 2 will commence in December to those herds who are compliant with the requirements of the schemes.<\/p><p><b><\/b>On the knowledge transfer programme and the sum of &euro;2.8 million, the programme is designed not only to help develop the skills base of Irish farmers but also to support a number of other themes and measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme.  The original allocation of &euro;25.6 million provided for 20,000 participants satisfying all scheme requirements.  A saving will arise because approximately 19,000 farmers are currently enrolled in knowledge transfer groups and a minority of these have not complied with all the conditions required to receive full payments.  Payments under the knowledge transfer programme commenced at the end of October and, to date, more than 13,700 farmer payments have issued.<\/p><p>I made &euro;43.6 million available in 2017 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies.  However, there are some savings as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving of &euro;4.5 million in respect of the current expenditure budget of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, primarily regarding the sustainable fisheries scheme and the skills and training measure.  There will also be savings of &euro;2.5 million on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department, mainly on a marine development team and marine spatial planning project.  These savings will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF because these investments will occur over the latter years of the programme.<\/p><p>Other savings are in the early retirement scheme, where participants receiving the State pension reduces the early retirement scheme spend by a corresponding amount, and research grants, where, due to a later than scheduled launch of the 2017 research call, &euro;7 million of expenditure will not arise until 2018.<\/p><p>Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to &euro;48.6 million and, with the select committee's approval, they will be transferred to fund the following measures.  A total of &euro;9 million of the savings identified will be used to contribute to the &euro;23 million Brexit loan scheme I announced on budget day.  This scheme will be operated in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The aim behind it is to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses that have up to 499 employees.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  The finance will be easier to access, will be more competitively priced - with a proposed interest rate of 4% - and will be offered at more favourable terms than current offerings.  This will give businesses impacted upon by Brexit time and space to adapt and grow into the future.<\/p><p>The new scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, through commercial lenders.  SBCI issued an open call on 21 November inviting lending institutions to participate.  The scheme is expected to be in place in March 2018 and it is anticipated that it will remain open until March 2020.  Supporting lower-cost, flexible finance is a key response to Brexit.  The very successful agriculture cashflow loan scheme has provided a template for such schemes, including this one for businesses.  I also announced in the budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.<\/p><p>On the GLAS scheme and the sum of &euro;14.5 million, there are now in excess of 50,000 farmers approved into the GLAS scheme over the three tranches, that is, GLAS 1, 2 and 3.  The environmental benefits to date are evident.  In September, the European Commission agreed to my request that provision be made for an increase to the advance payments for Pillar 2 rural development schemes, with the rate increased up to 85% under those schemes.  GLAS advance payments will begin this week at the higher advance rate of 85%.  The additional &euro;14.5 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this.  I urge all participants to ensure that they submit all outstanding documentation so that they can avail of this advance payment in 2017.<\/p><p>The sum of &euro;6 million for Bord Bia will ensure that it can fund a programme of additional activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  The funding, which is additional to the substantial funding already provided to Bord Bia for 2017, includes further market promotion and support activities internationally, in the UK and in other markets within the EU.<\/p><p>The programme of activities draws on analysis of data from the Bord Bia Brexit barometer exercise which was completed by 139 food, drink and horticulture companies and follows my Department's request to Bord Bia to undertake a major market prioritisation exercise to identify the best prospects for sustainable growth in individual sectors.<\/p><p> Areas of natural constraint, ANC, require &euro;4.5 million.  The significant level of financial support delivered through the ANC scheme over the years recognises the issues which pose a significant threat to the future viability of these farming communities.  In budget 2018, I was pleased to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to allocate an additional &euro;25 million to the scheme.  Almost &euro;200 million has been paid out under the ANC scheme this year and this extra &euro;4.5 million allocation will ensure the maximum number of eligible participants is paid this year.<\/p><p> The World Food Programme requires &euro;14 million.  Including the advance payment of &euro;10 million that I am requesting here, Ireland will have contributed &euro;60 million to the World Food Programme for the years 2016 to 2018.  The additional &euro;10 million provided for the World Food Programme in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the World Food Programme.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the World Food Programme's executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhance the World Food Programme's capability to plan its interventions and better address the several growing humanitarian crises around the world.  I also propose to provide an additional &euro;4 million to the World Food Programme which will contribute to its lifesaving work around the world, including helping 4.3 million people who are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  They include 350,000 children in the region who are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.  This funding, while generally targeted at the World Food Programme's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on a non-earmarked basis which gives the World Food Programme the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner and provide lifesaving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change.  Ireland will become a member of the World Food Programme's executive board in February 2018.<\/p><p> This is a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The savings I have outlined will be used to fund the World Food Programme, the Brexit loan scheme, green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and ANC payments, and Bord Bia and I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for its support.  I am happy to respond to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#A00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>On the &euro;4.5 million for ANC, I would have thought &euro;200 million was adequate to cover applicants.

We will be trying to draw on the lessons of the last scheme for the loan scheme for fishermen and farmers next year.  Is there something to be gained from pitching the interest rate at a different level that will encourage the banks to compete as well?  A lesson that could be learned from the last scheme was that, at the interest rate of 2.95%, banks just did not compete.  Outside of the pillar banks that were used by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was there an opportunity if it had been pitched slightly higher to draw in more competition from other sectors?

It keeps a degree of context on the scale of challenges that are being faced.  It is one challenge to which Ireland is glad to respond.  It is part of a three-year cycle of commitments we have made to the World Food Programme.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the specialist food producer scheme, we are focusing on the artisan food sector.  The scheme has yet to be designed and that is why the savings are currently there.  We recognise that the artisan food sector is part of the colour of Ireland's food offering and tourism product.  There is great interest now in provenance and the specialist food sector has a great story to tell.  The sector is also putting its foot in the export market but it is substantially for the domestic consumer.  It is quite a significant sector and the scheme is primarily geared towards the artisan food sector.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the sheep welfare scheme applicants, a simple calculation was done.  On the basis of there being 2.5 million ewes in the State the scheme was estimated to cost &euro;25 million.  For one reason or another, despite the best efforts of the Department to advertise the availability of the scheme, and the despite the fact that the scheme was widely recognised as simple to avail of, not all sheep farmers who were eligible for the scheme applied for it.  That is a disappointment.  The scheme will reopen next year and will have a provision for new applicants.  Maybe word of mouth might see the uptake increase.  The saving is there because it was demand led.  We budgeted for the maximum, with everybody participating.  We have made an 85% payment on it.  This leaves us with 85% of the number of applicants.  Having budgeted for &euro;25 million the balancing payment will issue in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#C01000","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>On the figure for the underspend for last year for the Department, I cannot recall exactly but I believe the leftover at the end of the year was to the tune of &euro;70 million.  Will the Minister indicate what that figure was at the year end and what was done with those funds?  Were they left in the Department?  Were they carried over?<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister is moving &euro;48 million today from a certain number of funds and destinations to others.  Does the Minister expect an underspend in the Department at the end of the year aside from this?  I do not see any reference to TAMS in today's figures but TAMS certainly seems to be underspent this year.  Does the Minister have any data on that?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the &euro;6.5 million allocation.  It is very welcome and necessary and is something we pushed for over a period of time.  Is it going to be built into the base fund going forward, or is the &euro;6.5 million a once off?<\/p> <p>  The Minister is transferring &euro;8 million from the sheep welfare scheme into other programmes.  There was a very sensible suggestion put forward relating to hill sheep - an additional &euro;5 given on hill sheep - especially given the pressure the sector is under with margins being so low.  I thought this was a worthy suggestion.  Has the Minister considered this proposal?  Perhaps he will clarify why he is not going down that route.<\/p> <p>  The Minister proposes to move additional funds into GLAS to bring it up to the 85% forward payment.  There were significant issues and difficulties last year in relation to GLAS but the Minister is moving &euro;14.5 million into it.  Given that the payments are due to start issuing next week, as the Minister indicated in his opening statement, how confident does he feel that the difficulties experienced last year will not be repeated this year?  With the commonage management plans, up to 9,000 applicants, or 20%, potentially have commonage.  An issue is brewing where payments may be delayed to those who have not been able to get their commonage management plans completed, which is the vast majority.  I honestly believe that a way should be found to pay them in advance pending the plans being completed.  They should not have to wait.  There were delays in the Department also in getting the system up and running and in making sure it was all in order.  It is important farmers are not left to feel the financial pain as a result of that.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that it is slightly off-topic but will the Minister comment on the areas that were burned?  Those farmers' payments are delayed.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the hill burning that occurred earlier in 2017 with gorse burning.  Hills and commonages in particular were burned.  As a result farmers' single farm payments are delayed because their areas are declared ineligible.  It is a real issue for those involved.  It is tricky and messy and we need to find a resolution.  There are many genuine cases where things happen which are outside people's control.  While they may have had nothing to do with it, they had their hill burned and are now finding difficulties with their payment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the fodder scheme.  I echo his comments in that regard.  The Minister has said that he will look at the scheme in due course.  Perhaps the Minister will define what he means by \"in due course\".  Given the fact that the issue is recognised, would it not be appropriate to put a small fund in place sufficient to provide assistance to these farmers?  This would mean that where the Teagasc assessment identifies farmers in difficulty early engagement and assistance would be given.  This is especially relevant in the provision of concentrates.  By providing some concentrates, or funding towards concentrates, at an early stage it can take the pressure off, increasing prices for roughage fodder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#C01100","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for his questions.  With regard to the underspend, it is important to put it in the context of the Department's overall budget of &euro;2.5 billion.  The underspend is less than 2%.<\/p><p>In the context of trying to manage departmental expenditure of this scale, it is quite a fine act to bring in the expenditure as close as that.  The fact that 70% of the Department's expenditure is concentrated in the last quarter of the year makes the management of that expenditure quite a challenge.<\/p><p> The issue of GLAS payments has been mentioned.  I am advised that our systems will be fit for purpose when we hit the \"pay\" button later this week.  Obviously, certain issues are outside the control of the Department.  Last year's issues are well documented.  We are hoping against hope that all of the thousands of outstanding nutrient management plans will come in to enable us to pay all farmers for whom that is the issue.  A completed commonage management plan is no longer required.  My understanding is that as long as the adviser has commenced the uploading of the plan, and this is registered with the Department's online system, that should be sufficient to clear the way for payment.  The advice we received during our engagement with planners was that they started the process of compiling commonage management plans a considerable time ago.  All that remains is for them to engage with the Department's online system to upload those plans.  When we have received evidence of such engagement, the commonage management plans will not be an impediment to the releasing of payments.  We are on target to pay the maximum possible number of people the 85% advance on the basis that the planners have started commencing the nutrient management and commonage management plans.  Approximately 3,300 nutrient management plans are still outstanding.  They are coming in at a good rate.  We will hit the \"pay\" button this week.  We will do another payment next week.  As they come in, we will be able to approve them for payment.  The additional funding for Bord Bia is a once-off payment.<\/p><p> The sheep welfare scheme is designed and approved by the Commission on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone.  I appreciate the difficulties that are being experienced in the hill sheep sector.  If we wanted to top up the payment, we would need to have incurred an expenditure of an equivalent amount to the top-up amount.  This would involve going back to the Commission.  If one looks at the simple mathematics of it, one will see that it involved &euro;10 for 2.5 million ewes.  We did not get 2.5 million ewes.  We will open the scheme again if more people want to participate in it.  It is not open to us to make the payment for which the Deputy is calling.<\/p><p> There is not much I can add in respect of the fodder issue.  I think it is appropriate to ask.  If we did this in reverse - if we committed public funds without the appropriate input - we would be rightly questioned about that in the Oireachtas and by other public expenditure watchdogs.  We have to make sure everything we do is based on an analysis of the situation.  That is what Teagasc is currently doing.<\/p><p> I am aware that burnt land is an issue.  I understand that a couple of hundred farmers, or maybe fewer, are involved.  Deputies will recall that in the first half of this year, an outcry followed the media coverage of hill burning that was taking place outside the timelines for burning.  I suppose this is a follow-through on it.  The Department deals with these files on a case-by-case basis.  It assesses the evidence available to it in each case.  Landowners are entitled to exhaust an appeals process.  Nobody wants to see a bona fide victim of unauthorised burning by somebody else having his or her basic payment reduced for that reason.  Equally, we do not want to see a wanton disregard for the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The number of people affected has been distilled down from a far larger number of land owners to a relatively small cohort of people who are entitled to and should avail of the appeals process that is open to them.  I hope we reach a point where everybody gets a fair hearing in respect of what has happened on his or her individual holdings.  The Department's eligible land is also subject to audit by EU auditors in respect of this issue.  We have to be able to stand over our systems so that we do not end up costing the State money as a consequence of non-compliance with land eligibility issues.  It is a question of trying to find an appropriate balance.  The scale of these problems is relatively small.  Obviously, it is a blow for any individual farmer to receive a letter like this.  At the time, these fires attracted considerable adverse publicity because they were significantly outside the time permitted for burning and were of a scale that led to many difficulties.  The Department was obliged to respond.  Farmers should exhaust the process that exists in order to ascertain what the outcome will be at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#C01200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Minister did not answer the question I asked about TAMS.

The underspend is significant.  I support unequivocally what the Minister is doing in terms of subsuming the savings into various critical areas that need additional funding.  The aim is to meet targets like the 85% advances, which is most useful.  There is a &euro;12 million underspend in that area.  Is it difficult to recruit in that area?  What was the projected level of recruitment?  What specific areas were targeted?  Was the recruitment for Teagasc advisers or specialists or researchers?  Many good young agricultural graduates are coming on stream and I imagine they would be delighted to get into the Department to learn and get some experience before moving out.<\/p> <p>  Considerable work is done on inspections.  We know the Department is reviewing the Agriculture Appeals Act.  The quicker the review, the better.  I read with some alarm two articles by Darragh McCullough in the past two weeks.  The reports would make a person's hair stand on end.  I know that Department officials and those dealing with it are somewhat numbed as well in so far as they appear to be perplexed by the complexity of the various things they have to deal with.  These things are imposed by Europe - I am not saying they are imposed by Department officials.  Certainly, we need to streamline this area, especially if people are dropping out because of the associated complexity and because the eligibility criteria are so strict.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to targeted agricultural modernisation schemes.  Let us suppose someone is spending &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000 and buys a big bulk tank or new milking machine.  What happens if Department officials arrive the following day and the farmer has everything there and is using the machinery, but then is knocked back?  A person can have all the degrees in the world &ndash; I have gathered a few in my time &ndash; but if there is no common sense then no degree is worth a sugar.  I know that myself.  I have one case going into the Department and the details of it are frightening.  The person is an extremely hard worker and is working desperately.  He is spending &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000.  He is in for 40%.  His is putting in new robotic milking apparatus.  I think someone arrived.  The matter is with the Minister now.  We are in the middle of appeals and whinges and everything else.  I think we have to bring some common sense to these matters.  He bought the machinery because of the incentive provided by the TAMS measure.  Otherwise, he would not be on the pitch at all.  The Department's position will come as some slap to him and he will be &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 out.  We have to bring some common sense to it.  I realise we must have rules and regulations, but he did not start it one month, three weeks or a week in advance - it was one day ahead.  <\/p> <p>  A great friend of mine down in Mullingar used to scourge everyone.

When a young person is taking over a farm many hidden extras arise.  In fairness, the Minister has done a good deal in the recent budget and recent changes have been most helpful.  I was a great advocate of the installation aid scheme.  It was only &euro;7,500 but that aid was vital.  I know many young farmers took over during the 1990s and that was great.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the Brexit loan scheme and I know what he means.  He referred to the scheme by analogy as a cash flow scheme brought in by the Minister.  I hope the &euro;25 million will help ordinary farmers with the response to Brexit.  I hope it is not too curtailed.  I presume the Department will use the banks again for the Brexit loan scheme.  I presume it will be modelled on the previous scheme but I hope it is not as restrictive.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted with the Bord Bia measure.  One organisation I always advocate for is Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has done a great job and has a great record.  During Aidan Cotter's time in the organisation the amount of positive work done was extraordinary, as was the number of graduates trained.  Many of those who graduated through Bord Bia are all over the world.  A significant number are in America and they are being head-hunted.  That is a tribute to the skills they acquired from Bord Bia.  I would like to see more of them kept within Bord Bia.<\/p><p>With the wage structures available and the category of graduates coming from Bord Bia, they will be snapped up by other organisations.  We need them now and over the next three to five years.  This may be heresy but it is important that the Minister would go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and make a case for trying to retain a number of those people.  They are exceptionally good graduates and they are very talented.  I am acutely aware that a number of them are being head-hunted by various organisations in America.  As soon as they are in one job in America, they are head-hunted from that job.  It is not the most popular thing to say but because of what we must face over the next two or three years in the context of Brexit, we need those types of people with particular skills and expertise.  I would like to see us in the position to retain and reward them accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#E01000","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose.  On the recruitment and savings element, my own take is that the embargo on recruitment for a number of years meant the age profile increased significantly.  We are now trying to recruit but we are also losing quite rapidly at the other end with people going to retirement early and just because they have reached the age.  We are running to stand still.  We are just about getting ahead of it now and part of that comes from recruiting people in mid-year or the back end of the year, so we are not getting the full-year cost.  I am advised there is no particular sector where there is a specific shortage but it is across the Department.  We were hoping to get our staff numbers from just under 3,000 to 3,200 over the course of the past year.  We are starting to make better progress but it is, as I stated, a case of running flat out to just about get ahead of the attrition rate.<\/p> <p>  On the installation aid matter, a value-for-money audit was done on the scheme that was quite critical of it as an untargeted approach.  I do not know if the Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General did it.  At that stage one got the money and there was no specific obligation on what to do with it.  In recent years with the national reserve and young farmer top-up it costs as much and probably more than the installation aid but it has a specific focus.  If there is on-farm investment, there will be a 60% grant and priority access to the national reserve for young farmers.  These are practical and more focused elements.  I appreciate there are hidden expenses to taking over a farm and installation aid money was important for that.  Some of those expenses were related to improving the infrastructure on the farm, which now has a higher rate of targeted grant aid.<\/p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's comments about Bord Bia.  Not to tell the committee its business but perhaps it would be a very useful exercise to invite delegates from Bord Bia before it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#F00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is on our agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#F00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>They really have a story to tell and a challenge to meet.  They are being resourced to do it.  They are highly motivated people.  The matter of staff recruitment and retention is inexorably tied up with public sector pay and it would be very difficult to specifically ring-fence this for Bord Bia when there is a host of other sectors in the economy seeking higher than the average pay increases.  They do an excellent job.<\/p> <p>  We are not quite sure why there has not been full take-up in the sheep welfare scheme.  The scheme was designed in very close consultation with farm organisations and it is very practical.  It is designed for the needs of both the hill sheep farmer side and the lowland farmer.  There are options that can be used.  We were surprised we did not have closer to a full take-up.  In any scheme that might happen.  Now that the first tranche of claimants are out there and we will re-open it, we hope to see more people coming in.  It is a very simple scheme to comply with.<\/p> <p>  The review of the appeal system is up and running.  I have a slightly different view that we should be careful what we wish for.  I believe the system worked reasonably well but the review is up and running and has eminent people involved with it.  Let us see where the chips will fall.  The agricultural appeals model is different from others and perhaps we should be glad it was somewhat different.  Let us see how this plays out.<\/p> <p>  On specific cases of the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, there is a requirement for a level of inspections.  I would like to think Department staff are, by and large, very practical people with such inspections.  That is my experience.  There are regulations, compliance and audits of which we must be cognisant.  If the Deputy has an individual case he would like to bring to our attention, we are certainly prepared to look at it.<\/p> <p>  I also believe in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  It can bring a degree of scientific evidence to the industry that is required.  We have a very commercially focused dairy sector.  If we could get 30,000 to 40,000 highly focused commercial beef people, we would have a great foundation for an industry.  The problem is the industry is currently haphazard and fractured, with too many cattle movements and not enough cradle-to-grave operations on the beef side.  On that basis, too many people are trying to make a slice from an animal.  The BDGP has the potential to do for the beef side what genetic improvement has done for the dairy side over many years.  In any scheme, in due course we must look at it to see if it delivers and whether we need to tweak it.  We would have thought there would have been more applicants.  Apart from the few that came in, thousands of people were in it and left voluntarily.  There were nearly 5,000 who originally applied and did not activate their application.  The big challenge in the Irish agricultural industry is to drive a substantial cohort of commercial beef operations.  All the evidence is there, from the Teagasc farms on different soil types, that although the incomes may not be comparable with dairy, one can have a decent income in the beef sector if all the correct management decisions are being made.  BDGP is only one aspect and grassland management etc. is another.  It is a good scheme and in due course we will have to look at it and see if it is delivering and whether it should be tweaked etc.  It has great potential to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2017112800002#F00400","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511892600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I have a question on capital expenditures.

I have a few questions myself.  I visited Oberstown shortly after I was appointed Chairman of the committee.  I should have done so long before because it is in my constituency.  Having visited the facility for quite a number of hours there were a number of observations that I made in line with the witnesses' report.  I visited before I read the report.  I found it alarming that the State would invest such significant sums of money in a facility without adhering to the basic principles in other detention facilities albeit I accept entirely that we are talking about juveniles.  However, the basic principles are the same.<\/p> <p>  One was fire safety.  That was very clear and made very obvious to me when visiting.  At the back of the building one passes a fire door with a notice that it is blocked closed.  I  am not sure 4 x 4 would justify how large this piece of wood was jamming it closed because the security on the door was compromised.  Other basic principles like door sizes, frame sizes being all completely different, and locking systems being similar in my observation to domestic residences.  I know from that visit that Oberstown management were pleased that they had co-operation from the Irish Prison Service in the provision of their locks.  However, the fact that the State had expended so much money on a facility, and multiple elements within the same facility, without doing the basic research to me was not just shocking.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  I found that appalling not just that the witnesses had to go out and highlight the obvious.<\/p><p>The staff were put in a position whereby they could not guarantee the integrity of the building in which certain juveniles were being detained and-or assessed.  That was an observation I wanted to get off my chest since I visited the facility some months ago.  <\/p><p> My main question concerns the positives the witnesses have highlighted in the report in term of the response from staff and management in Oberstown.  It is very clear, having visited the centre and seen, for example, the profiling research which has been completed or is underway, that the basic responses which are being implemented on foot of the report are positive.  <\/p><p> Unfortunately, there are number of themes which I am aware the witnesses have been assessing for many years.  Ms Boyle referred to it being a learning curve, but elements have been left unaddressed.  <\/p><p> I refer to health, which is listed as an area of major non-compliance.  I do not have a specific question because the report clearly highlights some of the issues.

A nurse gave a briefing to staff and staff on shift were trained, who then trained other staff to ensure the intervention would be put in place if required.<\/p> <p>  The second immediate action concerned the safe storage of medication.  We found keys left in a medication cabinet and there was concern that a child or young person could gain access to medication.

I am accompanied today by Ms Iqra Zainul Abedin, Mr. Alex Costello and Mr. Shane McNamee from the Department of Finance who work with me on this file.<\/p> <p>  I would like to remind the committee of where we have come from in terms of the European model.  The European system of financial supervision, ESFS, was introduced in 2011 to strengthen the supervision frameworks in Europe.  The system as it is includes the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, the three European supervisory authorities, namely, the European Banking Authority, EBA, the European Securities Markets Authorities, ESMA, and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, along national supervisors.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Commission published a consultation paper on the framework.  Member states, including Ireland, submitted views with many signalling that at this point, targeted amendments to the framework was the preferred approach, rather than a more fundamental change with additional new roles for the various supervisory bodies.  Following that consultation, the Commission is now proposing legislative measures to amend the ESFS with the stated aim of strengthening the Union's integrated supervision framework in order to promote the capital markets union, market integration and financial stability, and to respond to the new challenges which the Union is facing following the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union.<\/p> <p>  The Commission's proposal is amending a number of pieces of existing legislation and introduces new powers and roles for the European supervisory authorities, ESAs, a number of which will have a significant impact on our financial services sector and on the work of our relevant competent authorities in here in Ireland.   The Commission's proposal maintains the board of supervisors' position as the main body of the ESAs in charge of its overall guidance and decision making.  However, the proposal seeks to change the composition of the board to include full-time members of the relevant ESA.  These full time staff members will be part of a new executive board, the main function of which will be to examine, give an opinion, and make proposals on all matters to be decided by the board of supervisors.  It would also be the decision-making body for certain tasks of a non-regulatory nature, such as dispute settlements, breach of Union law and independent reviews.<\/p><p>We have previously supported the concept of introducing permanent staff members to the board of supervisors of the different European supervisory authorities, ESAs, but the executive board as proposed by the Commission dilutes the power of the national competent authorities too far.  These are the people with the required expertise and knowledge of their local markets.<\/p><p> The proposals also aim to significantly strengthen the existing powers of the ESAs through independent reviews of national authorities' activities and early intervention in cases of possible supervisory arbitrage.  The Commission has argued that these extra powers are required to ensure European rules are applied equally by all member states or, in other words, that we ensure supervisory convergence across the union.  We fully support a move towards a greater focus of the ESAs on supervisory convergence, but the Commission is introducing new powers for them which will, in effect, provide them a role in the day-to-day authorisation and supervision of relevant entities.  This is not warranted.  For example, one of the new powers envisaged for the ESAs is the ability to co-ordinate the supervisory actions of national competent authorities in the area of outsourcing and delegation of activities to third-country entities.  The Commission's proposal will compel national regulators to notify an ESA every time they receive a request for authorisation by a firm that delegates part of its activities outside the union.  We see the framework being proposed for the delegation of activities to third countries as adding further unnecessary complexity, when the existing powers available to the ESAs could achieve the same result of ensuring supervisory convergence.  The European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, issued an opinion in July 2017 to support supervisory convergence in the area of asset management which highlighted what national competent authorities should consider when allowing an entity to delegate functions such as asset management.  This is a good example of how the ESAs can use their existing powers to help ensure supervisory convergence across the union.  <\/p><p> With regard to direct supervision roles, the Commission's proposal intends to give further direct supervisory roles to the ESMA, as it believes the only way to ensure supervisory convergence is to provide a direct supervisory role for ESAs in certain cases.  The Commission's proposal will give the ESMA supervisory responsibility for the approval of certain categories of prospectuses.  They are wholesale non-equity prospectuses, those drawn up by specialist issuers, those of asset-backed securities and those by third country issuers.  In addition, the ESMA will be given responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of certain types of investment funds structures - European venture capital funds, European social entrepreneurship funds and European long-term investment funds.<\/p><p> As we highlighted in our response to the Commission consultation paper, we see no need for the ESMA to be given a direct supervisory role in the area of investment funds.  We stated in our response that the existing powers of the ESMA are sufficient to ensure the European rules applicable to all investment funds and also to prospectuses are applied equally across the union and thus ensure supervisory convergence between member states.<\/p><p> The use of peer reviews is a very powerful tool to ensure the single rule book is applied equally.  The existing toolkit should be used more frequently by the ESAs before the Commission considers such a fundamental change as moving supervision of some investment funds and approval of certain prospectuses to a central European body.  <\/p><p> Along with a majority of member states, we have voiced concerns over the scale and impact of the proposals at council.  In particular, the increased role being proposed for the ESMA has been criticised by a large number of member states.  This file will be progressed under the Bulgarian presidency and we expect further meetings at a technical level to commence in January.  We will continue to engage, make our valid points known, work with other member states and seek to have a more proportionate outcome from this review. <\/p><p> To conclude, in this proposal, the Commission has introduced significant changes to the European supervisory authorities' framework with the stated aim of creating a stronger and more integrated European financial supervision system for the capital markets union.  Ireland has been an enthusiastic supporter of the capital markets union project, as we see the provision of more non-bank financing would be of significant benefit to the real economy, not only in Ireland but across the union.  However, we believe the proposed changes will not help to achieve the aim of developing Europe&rsquo;s capital markets.  They will instead add further complexity and costs for entities engaging with European markets.  In addition, we also fully believe in the need to prevent regulatory arbitrage and to ensure the rules agreed between the co-legislators are applied equally across the union.  That does not mean we believe in a significantly reduced role for national competent authorities. <\/p><p> The proposed changes to the ESAs will dilute the input of national competent authorities in decision-making processes.  We must remember that these are the people with the expert knowledge of local markets and, in particular, who have the corporate knowledge of the firms operating there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to appear before it today to discuss the European Commission&rsquo;s proposed package of measures on the European supervisory authorities, ESAs, and the European systemic risk board, ESRB.

The principal decision-making bodies of the ESAs are their respective boards of supervisors, which consist of heads or alternates of the national competent authorities and are chaired in each case by a chairperson elected by the boards of supervisors for five years, a position which is renewable once.  The proposed changes to this supervisory architecture would affect the governance, role and funding of the ESAs and include an enhanced role for ESMA as a direct supervisory authority over certain activities.  The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals are under consideration by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The Department of Finance is representing Ireland at the negotiations in the Council.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s role is twofold.  It is to provide the Department with technical assistance and analysis in support of its engagement in the negotiations and to examine the proposals from a regulatory and supervisory perspective and communicate appropriately in that regard.  The proposals are broad and consequential and analysis by the Central Bank is ongoing.  Our comments today should be taken in that context. <\/p> <p>  In carrying out our work in respect of the proposals, the Central Bank will be guided by a number of considerations that, from a regulatory perspective, are important when considering proposed changes to the ESAs.  First, the European supervisory architecture was reformed substantially following the crisis.  Since its introduction in 2011, the ESFS framework has in general worked well.  The ESAs have delivered well on their objectives based on a good balance between centralised and local responsibilities.  Therefore, the baseline should be that we are starting from a good position.  Second, reforms to the ESAs should be in line with the broad objectives of financial supervision.  These are the achievement of financial stability; consumer and investor protection and orderly, fair, and well-functioning financial markets, all supporting a sustainably growing economy.  Third, while increased supervisory convergence is desirable, this is distinct from the centralisation of powers.  It is very important that the integrity of supervisory responsibilities and decision-making processes is maintained in order to ensure effectiveness and appropriate accountability of decision-makers.  The introduction of fragmentation or uncertainty in this regard, which leaves any doubt about the decision-making authority of the relevant supervisor, should be avoided. <\/p> <p>  I will mention some aspects of the proposals the Central Bank is focusing on.  On the question of governance, the proposals would entail significant reform to the current functioning of the ESAs.  The main proposed change in this regard is the introduction of an executive board for each of the ESAs.  The executive boards would have powers including the development of three-year strategic supervisory plans, with which NCAs should comply; preparing decisions of the board of supervisors; carrying out binding mediation between national competent authorities; reviewing the activities of national competent authorities; and assessing third country delegation and outsourcing arrangements by EU regulated entities.  <\/p> <p>  As we have said, in our response to the European Commission&rsquo;s consultation on ESA reform earlier this year, we consider the current governance arrangements to be working well.  We are concerned by the breadth of powers that would be conferred upon the proposed new executive boards. This would represent a significant shift in responsibilities and risks confusion as to respective roles and competencies. <\/p> <p>  The Central Bank welcomes the proposed measures to increase the mandates of the ESAs in the area of consumer protection.  The proposals include the obligation to carry out in-depth thematic reviews of market conduct in order to identify potential problems and their impact, as well as developing retail risk indicators for identifying emerging risks of consumer harm. <\/p> <p>  The Commission is proposing an enhanced role for the ESAs in respect of third country equivalence processes.  In particular, the ESAs will be required to monitor regulatory and supervisory developments and enforcement practices where equivalence decisions for particular third countries have been adopted.  Monitoring ongoing compliance of equivalence decisions would be new and would be welcome.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal would give the ESAs a significant role in reviewing delegation and outsourcing arrangements by EU regulated entities to third country entities.  This proposal is the focus of considerable scrutiny by stakeholders and raises a number of concerns for the Central Bank.<\/p><p>These include the risk of introducing artificial barriers to well-functioning products such as undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, UCITS, and adopting a disproportionate or inconsistent approach in respect of particular aspects or practices related to the authorisation processes of the national competent authorities, NCAs.  It is proposed that approval of European venture capital funds, European social entrepreneurship funds and European long-term investment funds be transferred from national authorities to the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We have concerns about the logic of singling out these types of funds as the approach could result in a confused allocation of responsibilities between authorities.<\/p><p> Finally, it is proposed that significant prospectus approval powers be moved from national authorities to ESMA.  The Central Bank is the second largest approver of prospectuses in the European Union, EU.  We have developed an approach and a level of experience that is world-leading and which serves issuers and investors well.  Against this backdrop we will be assessing closely the technical detail of the proposals to understand their justification, practicality and implications.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I have a question on the governance structure.

With the current framework there is a board of supervisors, with a chair who is a permanent member of staff and a non-voting member.  There are also very senior people from the relevant competent authorities sitting on it, and there are 28 competent authorities.  Decisions would be made in different ways.  Some would be on a simple majority and some would be with qualified majority voting.<\/p> <p>  What has been proposed by the Commission is that we would have an executive board.  To take a step back, we have a management board structure within the ESAs made up of the chair of the relevant ESA and a certain number of members from the board of supervisors elected.  I cannot remember the exact number.  The European Commission representative would sit on that as well as a non-voting member.  That really deals with more administrative issues.  The Commission is proposing an executive board, which in the case of the European Banking Authority and EIOPA, the insurance authority, would be made up of three permanent members, with the chair of the relevant ESA and the European Commission delegate as an observer.  It will make certain decisions, whether it relates to binding mediation or breach of Union law, for example.  The way it is phrased, it looks as if the papers are being prepared for the board of supervisors.  It would be another group where we have no national competent authorities present with any views being put forward.  In some cases it makes decisions without national competent authorities having a say and prepares papers put forward to the board of supervisors.<\/p> <p>  Our response in the consultation paper to this in April and may this year was that we saw a need for potentially some permanent members to be on the board of supervisors to give a pan-European view.  This is so a domestic or parochial view could be broken.  We always said there needed to be a majority of supervisors on the board because they are on the ground making decisions and engaging with firms.  They will also be implementing the rules.  We feel it is important they have a strong say.  As I said, we saw a view for a more pan-European focus but the national competent authorities should remain in the majority.  This executive board up-ends that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":223,"content":"<p>What would the Commission say in response to that?

These are the regulatory technical standards that put the flesh on the bones of a directive or regulation.  There have been a significant number of these in the past five years, including the capital requirements directive, the capital requirements regulation, and the MiFID II has been completed recently and transposed.  We have seen the market abuse frameworks.  There has been a large raft of legislative proposals and these ESAs must focus on them to create the rules around them.  They have not been as focused on supervisory convergence so our argument is, rather than creating these new structures and diluting the power of national competent authorities, they should focus more on supervisory convergence.

I will add a couple of thoughts.  The Central Bank approaches this matter very much from a regulatory and supervisory perspective.  We have stated we are very strong supporters of the objective of creating a capital markets union.  The idea of enhanced sources of funding, investment opportunities and diversification funding are highly valuable.  The first question we ask, which is the same as the question being asked by the Department, is whether it is necessary to do what is proposed to achieve these objectives.  In many respects, as Mr. Gilvarry stated, some of the examples of convergence, even in the past few months, are quite striking, in particular, what the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, has done around Brexit.  ESMA established a supervisory co-ordination network which has significant oversight of how some of these decisions are being made.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked whether we are concerned about the establishment of the board or the powers it would have.  To take one example of these powers, the three-year strategic supervisory plan, we are very much concerned that we may somehow end up with an inconsistent allocation of powers and responsibilities.  The Central Bank has responsibility for supervision in the context of Ireland, accountability to the Oireachtas and securing financial stability and consumer protection in Ireland as well as in the European context.  This becomes complicated and potentially conflicted if the plan we have to follow is set at the European level and we have to stick closely to it and be assessed on it.  One of the concerns that we have, which we also observe in the discussion on funds authorisation, is about different allocation of responsibilities between the national and European authorities in respect of approvals around third country delegations.  Across the piece, what concerns us is the risk of fragmentation and inconsistency of approach which may ultimately result in a divergence between powers and responsibilities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>There is no consumer protection organisation in financial services at European Union level.

The issue is not one that we have considered as part of this process.  Again, this flows back to the point that if this were to move back to a European level, an issue would arise regarding expertise and how it would work.

There is significant convergence on some of the main issues we have discussed today.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the consumer protection mandate, the Central Bank raised this matter in its submission to the consultation on the ESAs in May.  We considered that there was a gap in the sense that there was not a clear and consistent mandate for the ESAs in respect of consumer protection.  It was not always the case that they could operate very well together across sectors.  There were divergences and differences in definitions across different sectors and we called this out in our submission.

We believe they move in the right direction, call out more clearly the consumer protection mandate in the case of ESAs, and add to their mandates in terms of carrying out in-depth thematic reviews and developing risk indicators.

The Deputy is correct that the funds industry in Ireland is sizeable and this comes through in the figures reported by the FSB.

First, because much of the so-called shadow banking sector in Ireland - others use the term \"market-based finance\" - is actually in the funds space, it is regulated.

This means where an insurance company is set up in another jurisdiction and provides services in Ireland.  One of the challenges has been the fact that we as a prudential regulator have not had sight of that. and we have not had the prudential responsibilities or other authority.  That has been a concern.  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has taken material steps to try to address that problem recently.  For example, what was previously called the Siena Protocol is now called the General Protocol and has now become a decision of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority sets up a framework and a set of requirements for authorities to engage with each other to provide information that allows them to ask each other questions.  As well as that, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has developed so-called platforms of co-operation so that where an insurance company in one jurisdiction is doing business in another jurisdiction and issues arise with that, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority will host a platform through which authorities can engage with each other about what is or may be happening and how it may be resolved.  Those are steps that have been taken within the current framework to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  Another route to go might be centralisation, which is the route proposed by the Commission.  That is a way of saying that we are going to bring the problems away from the local to the centre.  One then faces the question of how much of that one does.  For example, in the context of proposals, it is proposed that the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority would have the power to approve models of cross-border insurance companies but that is just one aspect of their business so does one end up with a situation where responsibilities are less clear?<\/p><p>At least we now have clarity on responsibilities and we can work around the convergence, co-operation and co-ordination.  Progress has been made in that respect.  The question remains as to whether the centralisation route provides the most effective way of addressing the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Is there any move on the cost of liquidation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#J00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>That relates to the question of whether responsibility for the policyholder protection scheme should be borne by the host state or home state.

The Commission has considered and discussed this from time to time but there has been limited appetite for it in the insurance sector because there are such differences between insurance models.  It is more a question for the political sphere than for the Central Bank to express a view on.<\/p> <p>  On the question of tracker mortgages, I am not briefed to address the issue in detail.  The question of culture and conduct within banks and financial firms is a key issue for supervisors.  It is something on which we can work together at European level.

As I said earlier, we called for permanent members with voting rights to be on the board of supervisors, with a view to trying to bring a greater European focus, rather than a domestic focus, to the ESAs.  We saw much greater use of peer reviews to ensure supervisory convergence across the Union, but we have seen the authorities going much further.  Rather than focusing on targeted amendments, they have opted for a very broad-brush approach, which, in our view, is ignoring the positives of having supervision at national competent authority level in respect of investment funds and other areas.  What is occurring is adding complexity, cost and delays in certain parts.<\/p> <p>  Within the Council, only the French and Dutch support the proposal.  Therefore, a large number of other member states have concerns over the broad reach.  We voice those concerns also.  Ireland and others have voiced our disappointment that the amendments are not targeted to achieve some fixes.  As I stated, the framework is in place only since 2011.  We have seen some areas that might need more focus.  Powers may need to be exercised in regard to the breach of Union law, including in respect of more mediation.  I have referred to peer reviews already.

With regard to the five or six roles identified, consumer protection and investor protection come last.  We would be interested in knowing how consumer protection manifests itself when a person has a relationship with a bank or investment vehicle of any kind for pension or other purposes.  Most people and SMEs find it very difficult to understand where the bank stands in this regard.  People understand that the Central Bank is absolutely interested in the stability of the banking system, its recovery and meeting international standards and norms, but costs and charges in Ireland, across a range of items, are extraordinarily high by comparison with those in most other countries.  When people fail to meet agreements, the penalties can be extremely high.  People are often left without recourse.<\/p> <p>  One of the main points for consumers and SMEs is that when they are investing in pension products, it is very difficult for them to evaluate the products properly.  As the witnesses know, very significant sections of the workforce are now in defined contribution structures for their pensions.  Unless an individual really keeps up with the financial press or financial information, how is he or she safeguarded in terms of ensuring his or her investment is as wise and least costly as possible and produces returns that are commensurate with other options.  That is a tall order but, as a society, we have moved from a quite paternalistic defined benefit pension scheme that gave people the advantage of a lot of security at the end of their investment period, provided the pension fund was well managed, although I acknowledge that many were not.  Now there are hundreds of thousands of individuals, and there are to be more in the future, who are managing their own pension funds.  Regarding the ordinary banking arrangements and investments of the ordinary customer or SME owner, what is the Central Bank's concept of consumer and investor protection?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#J00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The Central Bank does not have responsibility for pensions supervision.  Nonetheless, the broad thrust of the Deputy's question is relevant.  As she knows, consumer protection is one of our core mandates and one to which we have been and continue to be completely committed.  There has been a discussion at a meeting of this committee.  We try to articulate clearly that we are focused on ensuring consumers are treated fairly.  Our role is not capping premiums or controlling prices <i>per se<\/i>but, rather, ensuring consumers are treated fairly.<\/p><p>That is essential.  From the point of view of the Central Bank, not only is the mandate of protecting the consumer in itself a key requirement but that also goes directly to the level of confidence in the financial system, which goes to how the financial system supports the economy.  That is core to our mandate and central to how we go about things.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned that it is clear that we have a great interest in prudential and financial stability issues.  Those are driven by a wish for consumer protection.  There is a consistency of thought there.  I would also mention the recent establishment of the new two pillar structure within financial regulations.  Whereas previously we had financial regulation, we now divide it into prudential regulation and financial conduct.  Each has a deputy governor or director general in charge of it.  There are many reasons for that, including the proliferation of workload, but it clearly calls out that commitment to addressing conduct.<\/p><p> With regard to these proposals, as we have said in our response to the commission's consultation on this earlier in the year, we called this out.  We asked for more effectiveness in this space, stronger mandates and a more consistent mandate.  The proposal does not go directly on that route but it includes aspects which enhance the profile and mandates with regard to consumer protection.  It calls out consumer protection specifically which is important because a past issue was where different European Supervisory Authorities, ESAs, gather their consumer protection mandate.  Now that is clearly called out, as are some of the practices.  We think this goes in the right direction but there is more to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":257,"content":"<p>To follow up on that, how is this manifested?  How does a consumer find out whether or not the service the consumer is getting from a bank is more or less expensive than other banks?  It is extremely difficult to compare them.  How are consumers represented in the process in the Central Bank?  How many representatives of consumers are there?  I include small and medium enterprises, SMEs, as \"consumers\" because the people who often get the roughest deal are SMEs looking for loans and seeking to buy credit for varying durations and finding that if they enter into a deal and something is varied, the cost can rise enormously.  How are consumers represented, particularly at a time when face-to-face banking relationships are disappearing from a consumer and small business point of view?  It has moved to online banking and there is nothing wrong with that but it can be expensive to meet, speak to or contact somebody.  What is the response of the Central Bank and its European colleagues?  The impression there, which many people believe, is that because Irish banks collapsed, the role of the Central Bank has been to bring the banks back to a point of prudential security, safety and that at the same time consumers, a term which I use widely as I set it out, are gouged with charges, penalties and costs.  This even happens in the case of simple things.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank instructed banks to confirm who account holders are, which is ongoing.  That can be extraordinarily difficult from the point of view of consumers because banks come out with a bewildering range of things that people have to confirm with regard to the accounts.  Is there somewhere that banks can go?  Does the Central Bank have any contact with services such as the Citizens Information Board or the Money Advice and Budgeting Services, or indeed with credit unions where many people have sought recourse?  I do not think credit unions fit into this section.  Is there an easy way of explaining it?  If somebody has a serious complaint, does that person still have to go through all the bank processes or can he or she get relatively quickly to some kind of Ombudsman service where action may be required sooner rather than later?  Many people give up on complaining because it is a lengthy process which takes a lot of personal resource on the part of people to be able to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#K00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>We will have the opportunity to deal with all of those issues on 7 December.

I felt this was going slightly beyond my brief for today.  The point about what consumers are able to understand in respect of different products and offers is important and it is central to the work that goes on in Europe and the Central Bank.  An example from the recent past is the packaged retail investment products, PRIPs, framework, which has been a long exercise to try to have one or two pages on what exactly the terms of the product on offer are and how to make that meaningful for consumers.  There are many examples.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of online banking.  One thing we published in the recent past is a discussion paper on how to achieve consumer protection in the context of financial services in a digitalised context.  How does it work if people do not read terms and conditions any more because they press \"I agree\" as we all do?  How would that work?  That is a discussion paper which I think has been well-received and which lays the foundation for us to engage further in that.  The issues the Deputy raises are important and exercise us and colleagues on a European level.  The PRIPs example is one that took place across three ESAs and was a reason why we called for a single committee.  It was quite difficult to have the same discussion across three different ESAs but it was done across all three ESAs.

We will see changes coming through.  As part of that process, the Central Bank has changed its consumer protection code to bring in this concept of what we call inducements.  An issue seen across Europe is provision of services to people.  It may not be the best product that is being provided because one is paying a higher commission.  We are seeing greater disclosure.  There is more disclosure by people about what inducements they are getting paid for selling the product.

The point the Commission is making in this regard is that due to the large number of entities moving out of London and looking to set up subsidiaries or other entities within the EU so they can continue to offer their services to their customers within the 27 remaining EU member states, there is significant concern about supervisory arbitrage, or people looking for jurisdictions with a lighter touch framework.  The Commission is saying the only way we can achieve supervisory convergence is by moving supervision of these entities to a centralised level within Europe.  The UK's departure from the EU is advancing that change by acting as a catalyst to force it to happen.  We are countering that by arguing that although the UK is leaving, we do not see why the existing tools - maybe with some modifications - cannot be used to ensure we do not have a situation where one jurisdiction has a light-touch regime and another jurisdiction has a hard-touch regime.  Rather than saying the only way to achieve this goal is to bring everything to Paris or Frankfurt, we are saying the existing powers can be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I agree with what Mr. Gilvarry has said and I would like to add to it by mentioning another two aspects of this matter.  As Mr. Gilvarry has articulated, we will have a very large financial services centre right beside the EU but just outside it.  For that reason, over the past year a great deal of concern has been articulated about the risk that firms will pretend to be in Europe while actually being in the UK, which could allow them to get around European rules.  One of the arguments that has been made is that we need to stop firms outsourcing outside Europe as a way of getting around European rules.  We would not agree with that.  From our perspective, it is important that outsourcing is done well and that there is substance in Europe and in the Irish jurisdiction.  Over the past three years, we have built a whole framework to ensure there is significant presence within the Irish jurisdiction in the case of the funds industry, for example.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect of this matter I would like to mention is that when the UK decided to leave the EU, the Commission and many other interests asked what the capital markets union would look like without the UK.  That galvanised lots of thinking about the possible need to create a more centralised supervisor as a counterpart to the UK authorities.  I understand that is part of the thinking behind some of the proposals to move powers to the ESMA.

We provided a comprehensive written statement in advance, and in the interest of time I will not go through all of it but I will note some of the salient points.   First, as explained in the previous session, this package of measures is of significant concern given the potential impact on consumers, and on regulatory powers.  While there are elements of the proposals that we welcome there are several areas that are of significant concern.  Our association represents some 125 firms that collectively provide a range of services that enable savings.  They do this by offering them through regulated services.  In the process of providing these regulated services where we have investors using Irish funds from 70 countries, managers from 50 different countries providing expertise and the capital is being deployed around the world, there is an interaction and an interplay between local authorisation and supervision, which occurs by virtue of the Central Bank's activities.  The committee heard from it earlier.  It is also anchored in the European directives which facilitate EU market access, through passports and the ability to delegate activities and through equivalence and other requirements.  This interplay between the national competent authorities and the European supervisory authorities, ESMA in our case, works very well because both entities have significant pre-existing powers and its own governance.  This has all contributed to a long-standing ecosystem of regulatory and commercial activity.<\/p><p>It has been an outstanding success not only in an Irish and European context for over 25 years.  The funds industry employs over 14,000 people and has very compelling proof of Ireland's ability to both develop and scale specialist international financial services.  The ability to bring global expertise to investors is a topic that I will return to later in my comments.  <\/p><p> Clearly, we are also very significant supporters of the Government's commitment, through the IFS 2020 strategy, to develop employment in the whole area of financial services.  Separately, I have approached members of this committee to discuss the industry's long-standing request for legislative amendments in respect of the investment limited partnership legislation, which was agreed by the Government in July.  I know the proposals need to come to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, as a matter of priority, because the opportunity for employment is being squandered.  I wish to convey the good news that our clients want to do more business in Ireland.  We are uncompetitive in the area of investment limited partnerships at this point in time.  I apologise for my detour but given its key priority in my industry it would have been remiss of me to appear here this evening without mentioning the matter. <\/p><p> Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have talked about capital markets union and Brexit.  Both of the topics are interesting backdrops.  We, like others, are very strong supporters of the capital markets union.  The union, as well as being linked to a single and strong supervisory network, focuses on fostering stronger connections with global capital, helping to attract investment and also makes sure that the EU is competitive.  In that regard, we view some of the proposals in the ESA package as inconsistent and in sharp contrast with the idea of facilitating capital flow, particularly into the European Union, which badly needs same.<\/p><p> In addition, the disruption that may be brought about by Brexit is a topic that was discussed earlier today and I am sure will be the subject of many discussions here.  It is worth noting, particularly around some of the potential for the relocation of activities and how activities are overseen, that the European Securities and Markets Authority has issued a number of opinions specifically on this area.  It also created a supervisory convergence or co-ordination network earlier this year.  All of those things are welcome and serve to emphasise its existing powers.  Therefore, it is slightly surprising that just ten weeks after the opinions were supplied the Commission has made proposals that cover a lot of the same ground.  We welcome some aspects of the proposals but there are some pieces that have the potential to disrupt.  <\/p><p> We will confine our statements on the actual proposals to those aspects that are linked to the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We believe there are great benefits to be gained from bringing down barriers to things like cross-border distribution and ensuring consistency in the application of rules.  When we consider these proposals overall we tend to consider them using the following three questions.  What is the likely impact on consumers and clients?  How do the proposals improve the functioning of the market?  What is the evidence that supports the changes proposed?  It is clear from each question that it is not in any way certain or obvious that there is anything other than potential risks to consumer choice, that there is scant evidence of anything that might compromise what is already a very well functioning, successful and globally recognised system for deploying capital through investment funds.  <\/p><p> In terms of the additional powers that exist, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance referred to the areas of both  delegation and outsourcing and the direct authorisation of investment funds.  I will briefly deal with each of them.  My industry delivers a wide range of regulated investment fund products, very much through the existence of delegation and outsourcing arrangements.  That means we have different types of investment managers who employ various types of operating models and investment expertise.  They are based in different parts of the world but submit themselves to EU regulation, authorisation and product rules in order to deliver those capabilities to the end customer.  The fact that these types of arrangements are in place has been a key contributor to the success of undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, and, more recently, alternative investment funds, that were referenced earlier.  Delegation has worked extremely well historically and has been central in making UCITS, Europe and Ireland part of a very big global success story.  It is a key to ensuring that EU investors can access the best international expertise and that capital can come into Europe.<\/p><p> The proposal, particularly as it relates to delegation and outsourcing, envisages an enhanced role for the ESMA.  Specifically, all of the existing third country outsourcing, delegation and risk transfer arrangements, that might be pursued by member states,  would need to be assessed and approved by the ESMA.  It is important to note that there is an existing EU legislative framework that has robust standards in place for delegation and outsourcing whether it is internally or to third countries.  Therefore, we believe that the proposals for delegation and outsourcing would lead to a more bureaucratic, costly and inefficient process and  lengthen the time it takes to bring to market European fund products.  There is lack of evidence of any market failure, which must be a key hurdle in terms of the proposals to introduce new measures.  In addition, we believe there is less regulatory certainty under what is proposed.  We also believe it would send a negative message across the globe about the openness of the European industry, particularly at a time when the Commission's capital markets union initiative seeks to attract global capital.<\/p><p> In addition to the burden, a centralised review of delegation and outsourcing arrangements could have a negative impact on the diversity of arrangements that have served investors and industry well for the past 25 years.  The approaches taken to delegation and outsourcing, which operate within the associated EU and local rules, have developed over time via extensive consultation and scrutiny by the Central Bank of Ireland.  We believe that has led to a robust system that has investor protection as a core principle.  Earlier members here asked questions about investor protection.  I can reassure them that investor protection is imbedded in many of our structures.  <\/p><p> From our perspective, ensuring that the best funds expertise globally is available to investors and delivered via delegation and outsourcing arrangements has been key to the success of the European industry.  From an Irish perspective, the European market access that we offer to global asset managers is a fundamental part of the success that has resulted in us employing 14,000 people in 15 different counties around the country.<\/p><p> In terms of powers that we would draw the committee's attention to, and that were commented about earlier, is the question about direct authorisation for certain types of fund products.  I will name them and give the acronym.  The European long-term investment fund, EULTIF, the European social entrepreneurship fund, EUSEF, and the European venture capital fund, EUVECA.  The reason we have a particular concern about this matter is that it would move the direct authorisation and supervision of certain investment funds away from the model that is currently in place and operates with ease, efficiency and certainty. <\/p><p> The package proposed in terms of the authorisation of these products would set a precedent by creating a dual regulatory regime.  For example, the ESMA would be the authorising entity for a European LTIF whereas the Central Bank of Ireland would be the authorising entity for the manager providing those services under the alternative investment fund manager's directive.  Clearly, there is a consequential uncertainty as to which regulatory regime should prevail, particularly in the case of investor detriment.  A dual regulatory regime for these types of investment funds would undoubtedly lead to a more complex, cumbersome and expensive fund authorisation and supervision process.  Clearly, when one reflects on the 25 years that we have been involved in the authorisation and the supervision of funds, it would also require the ESMA centrally to accumulate all of the knowledge of local market prices and local conventions, and the investor protection mechanisms that exist nationally.  It appears to us to be cumbersome and duplicative in terms of effort.  We believe that the current system of supervision by national competent authorities, and in our case it would be the Central Bank of Ireland, are best suited to deal with these structures.  <\/p><p> Much has been said about governance and accountability and we have commented on the subject in our written statements.  We have always believed that while ESAs should be nimble and capable of efficient action, a balance must be struck between ESAs and the ability of the national competent authorities.  NCAs are answerable to their national parliaments and local investors.<\/p><p>There is a legitimate concern, as expressed during the earlier questioning, around what is the nature of the representation.  It is our view that some of the resistance and negative feedback on the proposals to date is around a concern about the lack of representational views by member states.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the funding question.  It is absolutely the case that post the financial crisis there has been a build-up in financial services regulation and supervision.  It created a real up-scaling in resources, including in the Central Bank of Ireland, over a number of years that was funded by consumers and industry.  We have no issue with that.  The proposals that are contained here suggest a recreating of this centrally in the ESMA, where we have already had significant ramping up.  I also point to the fact that there is very little in the way of justification or detail regarding costs for these proposals.  We would not endorse altering the current funding model.  We believe that a reduction in EU funding potentially erodes the ESMA's accountability to the European institutions.<\/p><p> Much of what I have spoken about is concentrated on what we do not like about the proposals but - as I said earlier - there are elements we support.  Clearly, the provision of information that would allow direct collection of information by the ESMA, which would incorporate the forwarding of data from the national competent authorities, would lay the foundations for common EU data reporting.  With regard to some of the questions that were asked earlier, one of the methods by which one can assess what action might be needed from a regulatory or supervisory point of view is on the basis of the data that is actually available.  The proposals would also support common data standards and comparability, and reduce costs also for all in the market.  We also support greater use of open public consultations on guidelines and on recommendations.  Ultimately, anything that enhances the practical use of the guidance that is available in the ESMA's existing opinions and in their questions and answers would be helpful.  A national competent authority should be able to consult with stakeholders alongside the consultation that the ESMA does.<\/p><p> Well-meaning as the proposals are in terms of greater cohesion, we believe the package underestimates and ignores the fact that we have a very well-functioning market for cross-border funds.

The Commission is undertaking a number of measures that are in play at the moment, which are very positive.  One of the things we have been great advocates for is looking at how we bring down the barriers to enable the cross-border distribution of product.  I will explain what that means.  The funds industry believes that broad choice of product encourages competition and encourages the reduction of costs.  The Commission has been working on how, at a national level, we can bring down the barriers to allow that type of product choice to come in to the market.  That is one practical example.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, reference was made by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank representatives to regulation.  We have seen a continuous process of regulatory updating and adding to the corpus of regulation that exists.  It is part of what we do as it is a regulated business.  From our perspective, we want to make sure that entities are appropriately regulated, and we believe they are.  We also want to ensure there is the ability to get good solutions in to investors' hands so they can save for retirement and age care.  We want to try to do this in a way that reduces as much friction and duplication as possible.  Ultimately, in providing services and in providing for compliance with regulation, there are costs.  We want to make sure there is appropriate protection, but done in a way that is sensible for investors and the providers of services to the investors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Lardner"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

For example, a fund could invest in money market instruments, which are cash or cash-like and bear very little market risk, but could be quite sizeable by quantum of assets.  The approach that the Central Bank takes is a prism whereby it risk-weights entities, and the extent to which regulatory time must be devoted to supervision and oversight is reflected in what is paid in regulatory fees.  One cannot make a simple one-to-one or linear relationship between the quantum in a fund and the amount of effort that is required to supervise it.

We are talking about deploying money into risk capital markets.  Clearly, there is risk involved.  However, to be clear, the risks that exist here are not the type of risks that exist within the banking sector, because the money here is not sitting on the balance sheet of an entity.  It is held in trust separately, for clients, under rules around deposits and oversight of that money.  That is not to say there is not investment risk in those monies.  There is clearly investment risk.  However, on the point raised by the Department of Finance officials about investment disclosure, etc., those are all parts of European regulation.

That is fair, and that leads on to the point that Mr. Cross of the Central Bank of Ireland was making.  Both the Financial Stability Board, established by the G20, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, IOSCO, have looked at the question of whether there are systemic risks or vulnerabilities associated with the asset management industry, which is a part obviously of what we do.  They have not seen it as systemically risky in the way that one might see other sectors, but they are focusing on particular issues.  They focused on questions about the liquidity of funds.  How liquid are they are if one needs to take one's money out?  They examined the extent to which things like leverage might be used.  Clearly, there are risks which are incorporated within global, European and local supervision, and that is where we participate very actively, to make sure we provide the information.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's last point raised a question about the extent to which the proposals make our industry less competitive or otherwise.  Our primary problem with some of these proposals is that the orderly function of the market is one of the responsibilities of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We already have a functioning market.  We do not see any evidence provided in the proposals that suggests there is a lack of function, or a problem requiring some of the changes required.  That is our primary objective.<\/p><p> If some of these proposals come through there might be less choice for investors in Europe around product, which is a bad outcome.  It would also not be as easy to provide access to European investors, which is one of the reasons companies decide to locate funds in Ireland and other places.  That would have a detrimental impact.  However, we are not, in our comments on this, separating the fact that it would disrupt what is already a functioning market, distort investor choice, reduce competition and increase costs in the absence of significant evidence otherwise.  That is the basis for our approach to this particular issue.

As members are aware, a review of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax code was announced by the Government on 2 September 2016.  On 11 October, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, set out the terms of reference and announced my appointment to undertake the review.  It was delivered to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on 30 June 2017 and published on 12 September.  The terms of reference of the review encompassed meeting international standards for tax transparency, ensuring that the corporation tax code does not provide preferential treatment to any taxpayer, implementing Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the OECD&rsquo;s base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project and various EU tax directives, delivering tax certainty for business and maintaining the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax offering.  During Committee Stage of the Finance Act 2016, several members of this Committee raised the matter of the role and sustainability of corporation tax receipts and that was added to the terms of reference of the review.<\/p> <p>  As regards tax transparency, Ireland was subject to a global forum peer review in 2010 facilitated by the OECD.  Ireland was one of 16 jurisdictions to receive a rating of compliant, which is the highest rating achievable.  In August of this year, the global forum published its peer review report for Ireland as part of the second round of reviews, which are assessed against enhanced standards.  Again, Ireland received the highest rating achievable - compliant.  However, it should take account of the recommendations of the peer review.<\/p> <p>  As regards preferential treatment, the criteria applied by both the OECD forum on harmful tax practices and the EU code of conduct for business taxation to identify a potentially harmful tax regime provide the internationally accepted criteria for identifying whether features of the tax code constitute harmful tax competition.  Any proposed measures to be introduced for Ireland's corporation tax code should be carefully scrutinised to ensure that they do not constitute a potentially harmful preferential tax regime.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transfer pricing, Ireland is required to legislate to apply the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines in domestic legislation and it may, therefore, be timely to consider additional changes that may be made to Ireland&rsquo;s domestic transfer pricing rules.  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s position in the global value chain of multinational enterprises, MNEs, in sectors which rely heavily on intellectual property, IP, is such that large amounts of royalties are paid out of Ireland by MNE affiliates to members of the same group in other jurisdictions.  The recipient of the royalty payments receives a significant return relating to the ownership of the IP.  Where the recipient of the royalty payments does not perform the requisite DEMPE functions, which are the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection or exploitation of intellectual property, or control economically significant risks, the application of the OECD 2017 transfer pricing guidelines may result in the recipient of the royalty payments being attributed a return which only reflects the risk-free or risk-adjusted return with respect to the recipient&rsquo;s funding activities.  Assuming transfer pricing rules apply to all trading transactions, the introduction of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines may have the impact of adjusting the consideration payable, which is the outbound royalty, downwards, having regard to the DEMPE functions and control of the associated risks by the recipient of the royalty payments.  Depending on the facts and circumstances, that could have a significant impact on MNEs operating in Ireland and the quantity of outbound royalty payments which are deductible for Irish tax purposes.<\/p> <p>  On transfer pricing, Ireland should provide for the application of the OECD 2017 transfer pricing guidelines incorporating BEPS actions 8, 9 and 10 in Irish legislation.  Domestic transfer pricing legislation should be applied to arrangements the terms of which were agreed before 1 July 2010.  Consideration should be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs.  Consideration should be given to extending domestic transfer pricing rules to non-traded income where it would reduce the risk of aggressive tax planning.  Consideration should also be given to extending transfer pricing rules to capital transactions.  If it is decided to implement any or all of these recommendations on transfer pricing, that should take place no later than the end of 2020.<\/p> <p>  There are various components of the EU anti-tax avoidance directive that Ireland will have to transpose into domestic law over the coming years, including an interest limitation rule, anti-hybrid rules, the introduction of controlled foreign corporation rules, an exit tax and a general anti-avoidance rule.  Various deadlines have been set for those to be achieved and, in transposing them, Ireland should have regard to the recommendations of the reports on BEPS actions 2, 3 and 4.  The exit tax was proposed to provide that member states are in a position to tax the economic value of any capital gain created in their territory where the gain has not been realised at the time of the transfer out of the member state.  The anti-tax avoidance directive provides that member states must impose an exit tax on the transfer of an asset out of its territory, the chargeable basis of the tax being the market value of the transferred assets less their value for tax purposes.  The directive does not specify the calculation of the value of the assets for tax purposes or the rate of the exit tax but, rather, leaves discretion in those areas to member states.<\/p> <p>  During the public consultation, a number of stakeholders suggested moving Ireland's corporation tax base from a worldwide to a territorial base.  The difficulty of computing the credit for foreign income, in particular when income arises from multiple jurisdictions, was highlighted as a competitive disadvantage.  Schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which gives effect to the computation of the foreign credit, has been amended multiple times since 1997 in light of policy changes and to take account of judicial decisions.  Accordingly, the operation of the relief for foreign credit has become more complex, which is seen as a burden on business.  In the context of the introduction of the controlled foreign company rule provided by the anti-tax avoidance directive, consideration should be given to whether it is appropriate to move Ireland's corporate tax base to a territorial regime in respect of the income of the foreign branches of Irish-resident companies and, in respect of connected companies, the payment of foreign-source dividends. <\/p> <p>  An alternative to a territorial corporation tax base is to review schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with a view to effecting a policy and revenue-neutral simplification of the computation of the foreign tax credit for all forms of foreign income.  That would achieve the competitiveness advantages associated with moving to a territorial corporation tax base while avoiding the introduction of additional complexity to the corporation tax code by new anti-avoidance measures.<\/p> <p>  A number of submissions to the public consultation emphasised the importance of public consultation and stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of tax legislation.  That can increase certainty for taxpayers and ensure that the views of all sections of the community are taken into account, including the views of NGOs active in developing countries.  It is recommended that a number of proposed changes suggested in the review are carried out subject to consultation to reduce uncertainty regarding the proposed changes and to better inform policy making.  To reduce uncertainty and ensure that Ireland protects its corporation tax base, Ireland should ensure an adequately resourced competent authority.<\/p> <p>  Several independent factors that arose together that contributed to the level shift increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  It is unlikely that any reversal of those factors would similarly coincide.  While that suggests that corporation tax receipts are sustainable at a new higher level, at least in the medium term to 2020, the inherent volatility of corporation tax receipts will remain and some of the factors that led to the 2015 level shift could unwind individually.  Given that uncertainty, we can never be sure of the sources and permanency of such revenues and it would be wise that policy should be suitably cautious in terms of introducing increases in spending or permanent reductions in taxation.<\/p> <p>  In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, the review recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%.<\/p><p>This recommendation is being implemented via section 21 of the Finance Bill 2017.  I look forward to our discussion and hope I can address any questions on the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Coffey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#S00200","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey for bearing with us for this considerable period of time.

One of the guiding principles of the whole BEPS process has been to have a greater alignment of profit and substance.  What many US multinationals, in particular, have been able to achieve is to have a large amount of their non-US profits routed to what are essentially cash box operations in small islands where they have no substance.  The rules propose that such cash box operations should only get a return based on the funding that they provide.  I refer to interest rates and return on capital, not on the actual profits the company generates, the substance of which happens elsewhere.  There is no doubt that the companies will adjust.  One change that we have seen some evidence of to date in Ireland is that they could move their intangible assets to Ireland simply because they already have the substance here.  That could lead to an increase in tax revenues in Ireland.  It will definitely lead to an increase in the gross profits declared in Ireland.

I do not expect that we will see the set of events that came together in 2015 unwinding together.  However, they could unwind over time.  Corporation tax is the most volatile of our main taxes.  If a tax can rise by 50% in a given year, it shows the uncertainty that is there.  I think at least to 2020 it will remain at the higher level.  Depending on how international changes go that could be sustainable for longer.  We will see inherent volatility.  We have not seen a reduction in corporation tax receipts on an annual basis for a number of years.  I think that is unlikely to happen soon.  It will remain at the new higher level.  It is hard to identify.  I looked at the elements that led to the increase in 2015.  They were relatively broad, yet dominated by the multinationals.  It did not necessarily lead to an increase in concentration.  Our corporation tax receipts are concentrated but that did not increase in 2015.  It was spread across a number of companies and it was related to a number of different factors.  I do see risks there.  It is more a medium term risk.

I favour looking at the amount of corporation tax receipts we collect and setting a certain amount of that aside.  The contributions to the fund could be based on the corporation tax receipts.  I have a previous proposal that looked at setting aside 50% of the corporation tax that comes from the multinationals.  That would offer two things.  It would offer savings in future and if there was volatility at least half of it would be taken out by setting those revenues aside.  We cannot be guaranteed that these revenues would flow into the future.  When we do need them to achieve other economic objectives then the fund will be there.  I see advantages in looking at an annual budgetary process, stripping out some of the corporation tax receipts from the multinational sector and operating a balanced budget on the basis of what is left.  That is actually saving the money.<\/p> <p>  Previously, we had a savings fund in the last decade, the National Pension Reserve Fund.  The money was not necessarily taken out of the budgetary process.  A commitment was made to make contributions.  However, it all remained within the general Government sector.  The Government deficit and balance itself was calculated on the basis of spending money outside of the general Government.  I would take those funds out of the budgetary process and balance the Budget outside of that.  I made that proposal back in 2015 and there have been variations in the rainy day fund since.  The key issue is to consider what the rainy day fund is to achieve.  The proposal I outlined would be about treating the corporation tax receipts as a sort of temporary bonus, like some countries do with setting aside oil revenues.  Alternatively, a rainy day fund can be used for counter-cyclical purposes.  Money can be taken out of the economy when it is performing well.  It does look like the current proposal is going in that direction, if not to a huge degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#S00900","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey for bearing with us.

More taxation is not being collected from the investment by reducing the limit because the amount of the capital allowance remains the same.  Those who would suggest that it is a retrospective change should be questioned as to why they think the tax would not be collected in the future.  A retrospective change would imply that more tax was being collected and when the capital allowances run out we would not be collecting the money.  In my view, the only way there can be a retrospective change is if more tax is being collected from the investment decision.  The internal rate of return on those investments remains the same, whether there is an 80% cap or a 100% cap.  If more tax is collected with the 80% cap it does suggest that the tax was not going to be collected when the capital allowances run out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":415,"content":"<p>It comes as no surprise.

We looked at 27 of the 28 EU countries that offer it and the country that does not has a cash deduction system - an upfront deduction for the amount one spends.  The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, has capital allowances for intangible assets and there is no cap on it.  The cap is a base protection measure.  Even at 100%, the cap offers protection that other countries will not necessarily have in place because we do not want a situation where if a company was to overpay for an asset and did not generate profits, if it still had the capital allowances, it could claim them every year and generate losses.  The treatment of losses in the tax code is different to the treatment of capital allowances because losses can be distributed around a group so if a company overpaid for an asset and did not have profits, those losses could be used to offset profits elsewhere.  The 100% cap prevents those losses from being generated.  It limits the capital allowances used to the amount of profit.

One then faces a big jump.  As long as the asset remains and the profit remains, one goes from having maybe all of it being offset by the capital allowance to very little.

There is a suggestion that it is possibly related to the activities of some of the so-called inverted companies that have set up headquarters in Ireland in recent years, simply because they are of the size and on the scale of companies involved.  One consequence of applying transfer pricing to non-traded income arises.  There are legitimate reasons for companies to loan between each other.  It may not be the case at present that they do that on an interest-free basis.  If we start applying transfer pricing rules and companies have to start charging interest, the company collecting the interest will be a non-trading entity.  It is a lending company and it may be subject to tax at 25%.  The company paying the interest would be a trading entity and would get at deduction of 12.5%.  Therefore, we could have a transaction happening wholly within a parent company that is getting a 12.5% deduction while the subsidiary paying the interest is paying tax at 25%.  That may be a concern for indigenous companies that have a cash company at their centre moving money from one entity to another.  I would advise caution on the move to apply transfer pricing rules to non-trading companies on that basis.

It may be another layer of taxation that is different to what is in force for profits at present.  The legality of some of these proposals may be subject to question, especially for sales within the EU.  Various EU directives prevent the charging of withholding taxes on flows between EU member states.  Maybe the royalties directive could be changed.  At present, withholding tax could not be charged on those transactions.<\/p> <p>  To what extent would it have an impact on Ireland?  It could potentially be significant but it is very difficult to say.  How does this relate to our overall corporation tax and corporation tax base?  The information and communications technology companies do not make up the most substantial proportion of our corporate tax base.  Far more important for us is the manufacturing sector.

Previously, I commented on not referencing the Deputy's raising of the intangibles issue.  Deputy Doherty's party has raised the issue of using Malta for similar structures in various fora.  I will offer a general comment.  When the double-Irish was being discussed, it was frequently said that it was not a provision of Irish tax law and that Ireland could not change it on a unilateral basis.  I tended to agree with that.  It is not a surprise to find other countries outside the tax havens in the Caribbean where it can be established or set up.  However, it is simply not a feature of Irish tax law.  It arises from the interaction between the tax codes from several jurisdictions.  Even if we were to change the arrangement with Malta, I imagine we could find other countries where similar tax outcomes could be achieved.  The key issue is the amount of tax that is levied at the destination.  If Malta chooses not to levy profits tax on intellectual property generated outside its jurisdiction, that is Malta's choice and I am unsure what we can do about it.  It is a Maltese decision not to levy tax on these profits.<\/p> <p>  What do we want Ireland to do?  We are looking at companies and their residence, which is a central part of this from the perspective of US companies.  However, the residence does not really matter.  The primary reason that US companies use subsidiaries registered in the same country is because in the US tax code there is a provision called the same-country exemption.  It means that if an organisation moves money between companies in the same country, it does not trigger the US tax payment but maintains the deferral.  However, if an organisation moves royalties between two companies registered in two different countries, that organisation is potentially liable to pay the US tax at 35%.  There is a plethora of ways an organising can generate the deferral, for example, the check-the-box and the look-through rules.  However, one issue with these is that they are temporary provisions of the US tax code and they are subject to a sunset clause - they could end.  In contrast, the same-country exemption is a permanent feature of the US tax code and would require a vote in the US Congress to change.  US companies go for two companies registered in the same country because of that.<\/p> <p>  The recent Amazon state aid case in Luxembourg featured a similar structure.  The two companies were registered in Luxembourg.  Money was flowing from one to the other.  Again, it was a decision taken in Luxembourg not to levy tax on the profits accumulated by the ultimate company.<\/p> <p>  Again, the single malt is something that has been achievable for years.  It was not introduced necessarily in Ireland.  In any event, it is a Maltese decision not to levy tax on those profits.

The companies and their advisers are looking for gaps that they can fall through.  The BEPS project of aligning profit with substance will close an awful lot of those.  However, a problem will remain with US companies.  They will be able to attribute a large part of their non-US profit - their sales to non-US customers, whose location should not determine where tax is owing, as opposed to their non-US activities - to licence holders or companies that have intellectual property.

If we do choose to go to a territorial system, we want to ensure that companies have the right profits here and are not shifting profits offshore just to bring them back in and declare that they earned those profits abroad and do not owe any tax on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#W01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Would the worldwide perception of our corporation tax system be enhanced if it was territorial rather than residency-based?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#W01200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I am not sure it would make a massive difference.  I think a worldwide regime does mean that one has certain protections and one does not need the CFC rules.  If we have a worldwide regime, then profits are taxed wherever they are earned.  If they are taxed at a lower rate than our 12.5%, when the company brings the profits back to Ireland, we can top the tax bill up.  The issue with the territorial system is that we are one of the few countries that maintain a worldwide regime.  Over recent years, several of the other countries that had worldwide regimes have moved to territorial systems because of the improvements in CFC legislation.  Now tax authorities can look at companies abroad and determine whether relationships are genuine or just being set up to move profits abroad.  I do not think it would make a huge difference.  Our worldwide regime possibly adds to our reputation because as soon as a company is resident here, it is taxable on its worldwide income.  However, it is down to the complexity of undertaking the foreign tax credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#W01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1511896500,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Is it possible that our residency-based system would be perceived to be more transparent and fairer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112800002#W01400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511896500,"counter":489,"content":"<p>If one implements the appropriate CFC legislation, I do not think people would view the two systems as being wholly different.
