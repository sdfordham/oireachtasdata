Everybody knows why I have put forward this amendment to make reference to the Equal Status Act.  It is because the Equal Status Act contains the infamous section 7(3)(c), which, incredibly and disgracefully, gives a derogation to religious schools to discriminate.<\/p><p>The Equal Status Act is supposed to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality, yet that subsection gives a derogation to schools to discriminate against the children of all people, which is shocking.  Amendments related to my amendment have been ruled out of order.  I find it extraordinary that an amendment relating to admission to schools has been ruled out of order simply because it relates to another Act.  That subsection of the Equal Status Act is the key to facilitating the ongoing discrimination against children in the vast majority of schools.  This intolerable provision has to be dealt with.  To discriminate against anybody is bad but to discriminate against children is outrageous.  A total of 72% of parents believe the law should be amended in order that baptism would no longer be a requirement for school admission, while 24% say they would not have baptised their children if they had not needed to do so to gain entry to schools.  It is incredible that people are baptising their children purely to gain admission to schools.  More than 90% of schools are Catholic and children who are not of that faith are segregated, excluded, isolated and made feel different because they do not share the dominant faith, yet they do not have the choice in many cases to attend a multi-denominational or a non-denominational school.  They are, therefore, forced into this invidious position.  Any reasonable person would say this is not acceptable.  Whatever reasons successive Governments had for kowtowing to the Catholic Church primarily and allowing them to dominate schools and pursue this discrimination, times have changed.  Even people who are of the Catholic faith recognise the inequity and injustice.  <\/p><p> As the Minister will be aware, another reason has emerged in the last while; as if the substantial discrimination against kids was not enough, those who run Catholic schools are now sick and tired of the Catholic Church's domination.  That has emerged in the recent period because of religious denominations selling off facilities and degrading the quality of schools and their facilities to pay off their debts or whatever else.  There is nothing for the Minister to be afraid of anymore because even the people running schools who may have long subscribed to their values and ethos are fed up with the church's domination of schools.  There is nothing to fear politically.  The discrimination is partially due to the political establishment being in hock to a particular religious viewpoint, but, more recently, it probably has just been caused by political fear of standing up to the Catholic Church because of the consequences that might flow from it.  However, there is no need to fear anymore.  On a moral, reasonable level, we should remove the baptism barrier under this legislation.  Even on a purely pragmatic, expedient, political basis, there is simply no reason to fail to do it anymore.  The Government should get on with it and do it.  It should even go beyond it and separate church and State completely in the entire education system and other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#A00600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I look forward to the passage of the Bill, but a number of major issues have not been dealt with.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett mentioned the provisions of the Equal Status Act.  I would be grateful if the Minister outlined his position on it and his intended approach in that regard because no amendments have been tabled.  Clearly, it is the ghost at the banquet and the issue that is central to school admissions, but it is not dealt with at all.  Many are waiting to see what will happen.  In particular, in the past week many school patrons who have a legitimate interest in the legislation have been having an uncertain time because they do not know what the position will be.  A consultation process is ongoing.  This is as good an opportunity as any for the Minister to outline his position<\/p> <p>  Second, the amendment also relates to the definition of the \"National Council for Special Education\", NCSE.  Some time ago I stated in the House that Fianna F&aacute;il would not be prepared to facilitate passage of the Bill if a provision, which has widespread support among Opposition parties, was not inserted in that regard, but it has been ruled out of order in our amendments.  It relates to giving the NCSE the power to mandate schools to establish special classes where it designates there is a need for it.  That remains our position and I look forward to a constructive debate with the Minister on the issue.  That has to happen and I understand he has given good consideration to the views that have been expressed on all sides of the political divide.  We would like that provision to be included in the legislation.  The NCSE would never use that power, but it would help a number of recalcitrant schools, particularly at second level, to provide the proper facilities for children for whom special classes may well be the answer.

I tabled an amendment to provide for the amendment of section 7(3)(c), but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to challenge that ruling, which I do not accept.  I have been in touch with the secretariat and was told that it had been ruled out order under Standing Order 154, but that does not stand up.

Through the Chair, I believe that section 7(3) of the Act is directly related to admissions to the schools.  The provision is fundamentally tied to it.  The baptism barrier is a huge issue in admission policies as it allows discrimination across the board.  It makes me wonder the following.  Why have we discussed the Labour Party's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill for more than a year?  Perhaps our discussions have been a complete waste of time and it should have been discussed by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  It is bizarre if we have been misguided in that way and the legislation will be delayed.<\/p> <p>  A huge issue of discrimination, along with the baptism barrier, is discrimination on the grounds of special educational needs.

I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that deals with the issue that Deputy Byrne and other Deputies have raised.  It would provide that the National Council for Special Education could advise the Minister on the requirement to open a special class in schools.  I will bring forward a Report Stage amendment on that specific topic.<\/p> <p>  I shall bring forward Report Stage amendments on some other topics that I will mention for the sake of speeding up the committee.  While I am providing in primary legislation most of the provisions on prohibitive selective criteria, I will bring forward an amendment to provide that the Minister may still regulate on any criteria additional to those specified in primary legislation.<\/p> <p>  I will bring forward amendments to clarify that practices such as mandatory interviews, meetings, open days and testing of parents are prohibited in all cases, including where a school is not oversubscribed.  I shall table an amendment that provides for the replacement of a section 29 appeals committee member.  In other words, a member of an appeals committee could be replaced to allow continuity.  It is just an efficiency. <\/p> <p>  I will consider a concern that has been raised by a number of Deputies.  I refer to the ability of Irish language schools to prioritise children from Irish speaking homes.  I will reflect on how that option can be achieved in a fair way.  To clarify, I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage and there may be some additional tidying up amendments.<\/p> <p>  On the substance of amendment No. 1, everyone probably recognises that the Bill already provides for a definition of the Equal Status Bill in section 7.  The definition of the NCSE has been provided in the appropriate section, which I think is section 66.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be helpful on the wider issue.  The issue of religion in school admission is not currently in this Bill.  Previously I have indicated that I intend to act on this matter but on a separate track.  I have had consultations on the matter, as has the committee, and I know that the Labour Party is preparing a Bill.  I have always indicated that I think it is unfair that preference can be given by a denominational school to a child who lives far away over and above a child of no denomination, no religion background or a different one who lives close to the school.  I believe that parents should not feel obliged to have their child baptised.  <\/p> <p>  If today's Bill is passed then religion will not be used in the admissions for 80% of the schools, namely those that are not oversubscribed and no child may be turned away.  Religion cannot be used as a ground.  It is in respect of the 20% of other schools that the issue needs to be addressed.  Following the consultations and discussions, I would prefer to deal with this matter by removing religion as a criterion for admission to oversubscribed schools except in three limited circumstances - first, where it would otherwise be possible to maintain the ethos of the school; second, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to ensure that students of that religion can find a place in a school of that ethos; and third, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to admit a student of that religion who resides in a community consistently served by that school.  This is a version of one of the fourth options put forward to deal with this issue that we discussed before.  The reason I have put forward this provision is because I believe it is a fair way to provide options for parents of children of no denomination or, indeed, of a different one from their local school in order to get reasonable access to a school without unfairly encroaching on the rights of other parents who want to have their children educated in a particular ethos.  This is a fair and proportionate way of using the religious aspect.  It will mean that religion is only very rarely used as part of a school's admission criteria in the future.<\/p> <p>  At the same time the Bill recognises elsewhere other strengths of a school community.  For example, the school decides its admissions policy.  It can give priority to students from the local area, the siblings of existing pupils or the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  There can still be a strong ethos around the school, which I support.  <\/p> <p>  The provision protects minority religions.  Many sides expressed that concern when we debated this matter in the House.  At the same time the provision respects the Catholic community.  Ninety per cent of schools are now Catholic.  The provision ensures that a child can get reasonable access to a school of their denomination under the existing provisions where 90% of the children are accommodated. <\/p> <p>  I looked seriously at the catchment area.<\/p><p>Deputies from a number of parties were keen on that approach, but I believed it was not as good as the one I was taking because, although it would be an improvement, it would still leave children from non-denominational families at a considerable disadvantage in their local area.  It would also not be as good for many technical reasons.  There are no catchment areas.  If we were to wait for various denominations to come forward with catchment areas, we could be waiting a very long time.  There would need to be boundary commissions to deal with disputes over schools sharing catchment areas and so on, but that is a debate for another day.<\/p><p> This is a difficult constitutional issue.  There are provisions in the Constitution on religion, education and equality of treatment and we must steer a proposal such as this or any other advanced by members through them.  I will be consulting the Attorney General to make sure I can draft a robust amendment along the lines proposed to bring back to the committee in due course.  It was not intended to be the subject of today's debate.  We have had a separate track and separate consultations on it.  I hope the committee will accept my good faith in this matter.  Not everyone will agree with my proposal, but I ask people to consider it in order that when we do have a debate on the substantive issue, we can, I hope, reach some agreement on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#C02500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am afraid that is not good enough.  Do not get me wrong: people have a right to their religion and if they wish to instruct their children on a particular religious view in their own time, privately or some other way, they are entitled to do so, but the idea that publicly funded schools could discriminate in any shape or form on the basis of religion, or any other basis, is just not acceptable.  That is what equality and equal status mean.  That is what equal admission to schools means.  Equality means no discrimination.  It is an unambiguous concept which does not need to be qualified.  The reason it is being qualified by the Government in its proposals which represent some improvement is we have outsourced our responsibility in the area of education to religious bodies.  Therefore, we are forced into trying to find compromises with them, but we should not have to and I do not accept it.  Equality is equality and equal status is equal status.

A very significant number of parents nowadays do not subscribe to the belief system of the patron of the school their children are attending.  We know that these children and their parents have a constitutional right to withdraw from that religious instruction, but I believe we need to go further than this.  We need to provide for the spirit of the constitutional protection.  As it is exercised within schools, it is quite divisive for children.  Certain children are excluded from the activities of the rest of their class.  This highlights difference between children.  I do not believe we should be doing this within the education system.  It also causes many organisational difficulties for schools.<\/p><p>At particular times of the year or in particular classes where a considerable amount of time is spent on preparation for the sacraments, it is especially unfair to children who do not subscribe to the faith formation activity in the school.<\/p><p> It is wholly inappropriate that religious instruction classes will be held during the school day.  There is a strong argument for moving them out of the school completely in the context of a publicly funded school.  This plays into the wider issue, which we discussed earlier, in respect of the rights of parents for their children to attend their local State-funded school and that it should be free of any religious influence - certainly free of denominational instruction - during the regular school day.<\/p><p> My three amendments provide for the timing of classes in religious instruction outside of the normal school day.  At a minimum, they should be moved to the last class slot in the day.  Ideally, they should be held after the normal school day and at school finishing time.  That is the only fair way of ensuring the integrity of the school day remains intact and that children are not made to feel excluded in any way because their parents have chosen for them not to attend faith formation classes.  We need to take this step now.  Ideally, it should be outside the regular school day.  At a minimum, we should be ensuring schools move faith formation to the last class in the day to allow parents the option of collecting their children and taking them home.  It would remove the awkward situation in which children are placed as a result of religious instruction taking place and they having to move out of the classroom with arrangements put in place for alternative supervision during those periods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#D01400","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.<\/p> <p>  We should perhaps have philosophy classes instead.

It is wrong.  It is not the job of the State to finance that.  I would fight to the death for somebody's right to freedom of religious expression.  However, it is not our job to allow public moneys or the law to uphold a situation where particular religious views are pushed in school at young people.

Every school is obliged to honour this.<\/p> <p>  The approach we are taking on this issue in the Bill is that we are requiring a denominational school to make absolutely clear what provisions it will make for children who do not want to attend the religious programme of that school.  It should be made clear from the outset in the admissions policy before a child is enrolled how this will be dealt with.  It has always been a matter for the individual school to make these practical arrangements.  The best way forward to deal with this in a sensible and flexible way is for each school community to look at this.  Progress has been made in this area since the forum on patronage and pluralism reported.  There have been efforts to provide good practice in schools generally, and in Catholic schools in particular.<\/p> <p>  I noted later amendments stated the provision should not, as far as practical, be unduly burdensome for parents.  That is a correct sentiment.  I will have to look to amending the legislation to accommodate this on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  The amendments preventing any faith formation taking place during the school day or requiring it only to take place at the end of the school day are likely to raise constitutional issues about the rights of religions.  The way forward in this area is to improve practice and to use the forthcoming approach of having a parents and students charter to develop that.  We should also give parents the right, if they are not satisfied that a reasonable accommodation is being made to pursue that, to go to the Ombudsman for Children with their concerns.  The approach we are taking with this Bill and with the prospective parents and students charter is the right way to go.  It respects the different school communities and their right to organise themselves in the right way.  We recognise there are schools with a particular ethos and parents who want to provide for their children to be educated in those schools.  This is the way of trying to accommodate, as best we can, the different needs of parents where their children are enrolled.<\/p> <p>  However, I cannot accept the amendments put forward by Deputies Shortall and Catherine Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#E00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I am fully in favour of Deputy Shortall's proposal.

There are students in secondary school who were told to sit at the back of the class, given a study class or are told to go to the library when religious instruction takes place.

Some schools are able to stagger religious classes to facilitate pupils moving from a class to class.

Other members have spoken about the need for a general education programme in schools on world religions, belief systems and philosophy.  Such a programme would be very worthwhile.  I also feel very strongly that we need to provide a moral and ethical education for all children in all State-funded schools, an ethical education based on civic morality.  The State is remiss in outsourcing responsibility to provide an education based on civic morality to different religious groupings.  There is an onus on the Government and the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure proper instruction on moral and civic matters and I would like to see it developed, as it is long overdue.  However, the Minister is proposing to continue is a situation where increasing numbers of children are being separated from their peers in the classroom.  That is not good practice.  He is also talking about a situation where in many cases children are being removed from the classroom and sent to another room or the principal's office to fill in time while their peers are receiving religious instruction.  That is not acceptable.  He is talking about a situation where children are being excluded from their peer group on a daily basis.  We should not allow that to happen in State-funded schools.  The provision of religious instruction or faith formation should be discrete.  Ideally, lessons should be held outside school hours or, at the very least, iat the end of the school day in order that parents would have the option of taking their children home.<\/p> <p>  The Minister did not respond to my proposal in amendment No. 181.  It relates to the rule book covering this issue.  It is Rule 69 in the rule book of 1965 about which I am particularly concerned.  For the benefit of members, it is important to point out what that rule provides for.  It states the religious denomination of each pupil must be entered in the school register and the roll book.  I do not know why that should be the case in a State-funded school.  Why is it the religion of a child or his or her parents anyone's business?  Why should it be kept on the register and in the roll book?  Rule 69 goes on to state \"this information should be ascertained from the parent (the father, if possible)\".  I do not know why that should be the case.  I am referring to the 1965 rule book, but we are saying it is the father, or the guardian of the pupil, where necessary, who should be asked to state the child's religion.  The reference to \"the father, if possible\" indicates how archaic the rule is and the need to change it.  It was drafted at a time when the diversity now evident in Ireland was not envisaged.  It is utterly out of date and needs to be removed.  <\/p> <p>  The section allows for religious instruction to be given during the school day.  I propose that the teaching of religion be taken out of the school day and that we move in agreement to make that change in the amendment.  What the amendment states is that \"religious instruction shall take place as a discrete lesson at the end of the school day and shall not take place at any other time during the school day, nor shall it imbue or permeate education at any other time during the school day.  This provision exists to afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, regardless of religion, ethnicity or family background and to uphold their constitutional rights under Articles 44.2.3 and 44.2.4.  Further, this provision exists to give effect to subsections (2) and (3)\".  My belief is that, as parliamentarians, we, the Minister especially, in his role, should be taking steps to ensure we afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, irrespective of their background.  If the Minister allows the current situation to continue, he is patently not doing so and disrespecting those children who are being removed from their peer group every day.  In the eyes of most people, that is not acceptable practice.  It is both discriminatory and divisive and unacceptable in this day and age.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to at least consider amendment No. 181.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#F00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Children are sensitive and vulnerable.  Making them feel different by pulling them out of a class is tantamount to abuse.  There is no other way to put it.  If a child is taken out and treated differently from the rest, separated from his or her peers and put wherever else, without guidelines being provided as to how that should be done, it is a form of abuse.  Without guidelines, it is left open to being even worse.  I hope and believe most of the staff and principals in schools are very decent and compassionate to all children.  If we are honest, however, when a particular ethos is at play and prioritised and this behaviour is considered acceptable, it can be the case that the child who does not fit in is looked down on, frowned upon or seen as lesser.  The system is open to that potential possibility which no doubt has manifested itself in children who have opted out being singled out.  Whatever way one cuts it, I cannot see how it is not totally unfair to sensitive, vulnerable young children and how it will not have a significant effect on them.  Anyone who has children knows how sensitive they are.  They ask questions about obvious contradictions and conflicts in the treatment of one person or thing against another.  It hits children really hard in how they look at and feel about the world and their place in it.  It is just wrong.  I again note, to quote from the survey of these matters commissioned by EQUATE, that 71% of parents agree that we should introduce a subject in school on all religions and ethical systems, while 18% neither agree nor disagree and only 12% disagree.  Only 12% believe we should hold on to the idea that a particular ethos should prevail and that, as a consequence, those who do not subscribe to it should be separated.  Most see the sense in it.  We know that a majority in the country have some religious views.<\/p><p>People with religious views understand that this has to change.  Any fair and reasonable person would say that is the case.

There is no doubt that for most teachers, parents and students, singling one child or a number of children out for removal from a general classroom at particular times of the day is not appropriate.  While that it may not affect many children, there is no doubt that children very often feel that kind of separation very deeply.  It marks them out as being the other.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin West, as well as in many areas of Dublin Bay North, most of our schools have between 30 and 40 different nationalities.  Some schools have up to 80 different nationalities.  It is almost certainly the case that within that cohort there are wide variations of religious beliefs, ethnic backgrounds and parents who have come from different parts of the world.  The population statistics in the last census are very striking.  I am not sure whether the Minister has taken that into account in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Some 30% of the population in Dublin West were not born in Ireland and-or their parents were not born in Ireland.  For different reasons, different groups of people from different countries and backgrounds have settled in small towns around the country.  The statistics show that Ireland has changed utterly over the past 25 years in terms of the diversity of its population.  It is very bad educational practice to pick some children out and tell them to go to the back of a room, the principal's office or elsewhere.  Children are being segregated from the group.<\/p> <p>  There is a very strong precedence for this in Irish education, as the Minister will know if he has read any of the works by various people on the history of education and its relationship to institutions.  Around Ireland, there was a widespread practice whereby children from institutions, such as a local orphanage, were made to sit in a group in a special place in the classroom so that they were marked off from the other children.  That is part of our legacy from a hidden Ireland.  People were in no doubt that those children were to be regarded as different socially and, in some cases, to be effectively shunned.  I am not suggesting that is the intention of the Minister, but he is following in the tradition of enormous insensitivity to children's experiences.  <\/p> <p>  There is an emerging consensus.  A distinguished educationalist, Professor Kathleen Lynch, has written extensively about this issue.  For the past 30 or 40 years, she has been an adviser to Educate Together and has set out the curriculum around ethical, humanist and social values and understanding the world of the family, neighbourhood, town, country, region, world and the great religions of the world.<\/p> <p>  A lot of work has been done in the area.  In fairness to many of the major faiths, their religious curricula also reflect a wider appreciation that we live in a diverse and globalised world and, therefore, different religions are globalised.  The numbers may vary from place to place.  The Minister needs to think this through and not go for a convenient and tidy solution.  He also needs to bear in mind that young teachers coming to work in places like Dublin West are keen to be positive and make every child welcome.  Boards of management are the same.  It may take time, but we need to recognise what has happened and what parents want.<\/p> <p>  I frequently meet parents, as I am sure the Minister does, who are very distressed if their child is picked out and sent elsewhere.  The Minister might say that if the parents knew a child was going to particular school that was of one or another denomination, what should they expect?  They expect their precious child to be treated as equal to everybody else.  That may surprise the Minister and people in the Department of Education and Skills, but the world has changed. <\/p> <p>  As I said, there are very distinguished people in the world of education who have written extensively about this issue.  We have a lot of documentation on teachers' experiences and their unhappiness with being forced to segregate children on particular occasions.  School principals go to enormous lengths to try to mitigate the negative impact of these differences.<\/p> <p>  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he rethink the proposal and offer his support.  The language of the recent Fine Gael leadership contest suggested a strong respect for diversity.  That is not evident in the Bill.  It is very narrow and obscurantist.  It harks back to an older Ireland. <\/p> <p>  We need to bear in mind that we have a significant population of young children in areas of growth.  There is enormous diversity, which is confirmed by the census figures.  That has been the case since about 2000 when very large numbers of new people came to live in Ireland within a relatively short period of time, and they now comprise a significant proportion of our population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#G00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider providing guidelines.

I would be inclined to support it.<\/p> <p>  I agree we have to protect the rights of those who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  My own children do not attend a Catholic school.  Religious instruction takes place after school hours and seems to work quite well.  It is entirely voluntarily, both on the part of the children and the teachers who do it.  They work extra hours, but they are under no obligation to do so.  They have no agreement with the school to do so, but they do it.  As it happens, there is quite a large take-up, but that is a matter of individual choice.<\/p> <p>  This is something that works in practice.  I would be reluctant to rush it through in this legislation.  Catholic schools are entitled to be Catholic schools.  That is a statement it is necessary to make.  We either have faith schools or we do not have faith schools and if we want to go down the road of abolishing them, that is not a road I want to go down.  I worry that amendment No. 2, in terms of putting religious instruction in faith schools into law, has the potential to effectively remove the ethos.  From my reading of it, there would be no religious issue at all during the school day, for example, First Communion or whatever, or no talk of it.  It would be kept completely separate.  I am not sure that is reasonable for a faith school and it is a decision we will have to make.<\/p> <p>  If we are to take this debate to its logical conclusions, we should say that we will fund a State system and not have faith schools.  I am sure that is Deputy Boyd Barrett's objective, and he is entitled to it.  It works very well in the United States where there is no difficulty with it.  Catholic schools work side by side and charitable donations allow poor children to attend those schools, so it seems to work reasonably well.

We are talking about one in five or even more across the country who are of no religion or non-Christian religions.  I recognise that we need to change in the face of that and I want to see more diverse schools being opened.  I want to see the transfer of patronage from existing Catholic schools to other patrons, but I believe also that it is good that parents want to send their children to schools of their own faith.  That is something parents are entitled to want and I respect and value schools of different ethos.  The strength of our system is that we have schools of different ethos.  Deputy Boyd Barrett does not believe that there should be a different characteristic spirit and ethos in our schools.<\/p> <p>  To be fair, my experience is that schools of all denominations strive to be open and inclusive.  As Deputy Burton said, many of them have children from many different religions and countries and they work hard to be inclusive and open for them.  That is my experience generally.<\/p> <p>  There is a constitutional obligation that these schools must respect the right of parents to withdraw their children.  We are providing that this must be stated openly as to the arrangements they will put in place to provide that for the children who want to opt out.  I support that and want to see that evolve through the parents and children's charter, and that we would see that improve over time.  Good practice guidelines have been developed by both groups of both denominational schools and otherwise.  The question is whether we start imposing regulations and saying it must be this or that.  We then get down to the practical issues.  For example, what provision has been made in one-room schools?  Are we providing that they must have a separate place and so on?  The difficulty I have with regulations is that every school is different.  There are 4,000 different schools and to come up with a one size fits all system that is fair and reasonable to the different situations in which schools find themselves would be an extraordinarily difficult proposal.<\/p> <p>  I recognise Deputy Byrne's point, and he has an amendment to the effect that these arrangements should not be unduly onerous, which is correct.  There should be a test of reasonableness for schools as to how they provide, but if we come along with regulations and tell schools these are the regulations they must have there is a risk that many schools would say they need the Minister to provide them with extra rooms, for which I do not have the budgets.  Practical issues arise.<\/p> <p>  Developing a system where we change and evolve, putting pressures on the system and testing its reasonableness in the system such as the right to go to an Ombudsman if one is unhappy with the way this provision is being made is the way we evolve from a system which has enormous strengths.  Every day, I go into schools, many of which are denominational, and they do not fit into what some Deputies are portraying as the way in which children from other denominations are treated within them.  They are treated with dignity and huge respect for their diversity.  That is the dominant approach of schools that are denominational.  I am not saying it is perfect in every instance.  That is why I believe there should be a charter and a right of appeal to have that tested.  However, to go down the road Deputies seem to favour of a legislative framework being imposed on 4,000 schools of a different ethos and many approaches does not fit with the evolutionary change we need to see to respond to the greater diversity of the population coming to our schools.  It risks portraying many denominational schools in a very black light that does not reflect the reality.  Many parents of other denominations choose denominational schools because they value the ethos they believe they will find in those schools, even though they are not of their own denomination.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to evolve with what I fully recognise is a changing situation.  I will ask my Department to examine this rule 69 which, to be honest, I knew nothing about.  My notes inform me that rule 68 was removed.<\/p><p>I am happy to have that identified with a view to removing it, as from what the Deputy  has said it does not sound appropriate.  What I am trying to do is respond across the frontier of our education system to the changing environment but I do not want to impose impractical obligations on schools that makes it more difficult for them to do the outstanding work that is being done in most cases.  The communities around the schools have a commitment to their school.  My approach is to try to strike a balance.  I think our approach is evolutionary; it is not to impose a model that we have decided on.   I do not think that is fair to those who have invested their time and effort into creating outstanding institutions across the country.  However, we must create the pressure for change and articulate obligations, such as what we are introducing in the Bill, so that we continue that progress.<\/p><p> While I will not accept this group of amendments, I will reflect on the points made by Deputies Thomas Byrne and Catherine Martin.  My instinct is that setting up regulations is difficult when one has to accommodate 4,000 different situations.  I would like to see a test of the reasonableness of the efforts so that schools are continually trying to improve the way they accommodate people.  That is the approach that the famous American Disabilities Act took.  It did not require immediate action but it operated in the expectation that people would evolve over time.  That is the approach that can be embedded in a parents and students charter and can be tested as it evolves over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#H00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>With due respect, I think the Minister is over-complicating this issue.

I think one has to bear in mind that some schools have already worked out the particular practices that suit the student and parent body.  It would be a very positive to allow students to take religious instruction in the first half hour and the children who do not wish to join the religious instruction classes could skip that class.  It takes the burden off the teachers and the school principal.  For instance in many multidenominational schools the practice in regard to preparation for Holy Communion, as Deputy Thomas Byrne referenced, is to arrange for the instruction in preparation for the Holy Communion class after the school day has been completed.  By and large that has been working very well.  I can understand that Deputy Byrne states that he is not aware of any of these instances but I am making the case that in parts of Ireland, particularly in the north and west side of Dublin, the level of diversity is unlike the experience in any other part of the country.  I accept the point that Deputy Byrne made.  Of course the parents, who are parishioners in the local parish, value their local school and they also do that in areas that are diverse, but the level of diversity must be dealt with in a fair and reasonable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#J00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 2. agreed?

It is based on the experience of the Department, which has dealt with more than 5,000 appeals and these are improvements that will make the system work better for both parents and schools.  There is a number of amendments.  An amendment removes a section that never was activated, it was a class of cases that could be brought by appeal, which has never been used.  It was a general power for the Minister to add new categories to which section 29 should be applied.  We have been advised by the Attorney General that it should be removed and we think it is better to deal with this through a students' charter rather than adding to provisions in section 29.  <\/p><p>The second set of amendments is to distinguish between two separate types of appeals.  One are appeals where a school is not over-subscribed, and where an appeal against expulsion, suspension or refusal occurs in such a situation, there will be an oral hearing.  The appeals will be dealt with fully <i>de novo<\/i>, so the appeals committee will come to its own conclusion, having examined and considered the evidence and materials available to it.  We are providing for a fast track for this process as it does not have to go to the board of management of the school first.  We are providing for a preliminary decision and the opportunity to appeal before it is confirmed.<\/p><p>This is trying to deal with the situation in a different way.  It is different from the second category, so we are distinguishing between under-subscribed and over-subscribed schools.  In an over-subscribed school, where there is a refusal to admit a pupil, the appeals will be on the record.  That means the appeal committee will rely on the same evidence and materials as were available to be relied upon by the board of management when it made its decision to refuse admission.In that case we will require that the board has reviewed the refusal first before it can go to the appeal, unlike the case of a non over-subscribed school.  It is only if the grounds offered in the appeal would materially affect the decision that the appeal will be heard.  There is additional hoops to ensure that the appeal process is not being used unnecessarily.  A third element of the group of amendments is that the new section 29 removes the requirement for parents of students in an Education and Training Board's schools to appeal in the first instance to an ETB committee, before taking a section 29 appeal.  That was in the old legislation, but it is a loop that is unnecessary and is being removed.<\/p><p>There are some other elements.  The new section 29 includes a number of provisions to improve the day-to-day operation of the process.  These include removing the requirement for an inspector to be on every appeals committee and setting out the number of days of suspension before an appeal can be made.  The number of days of suspension is being set at 20 days.  This has been agreed with parents' groups and is based on practice that has evolved.  We are removing the current mandatory requirement for appeals to be heard within 30 days from date of receipt and instead we are providing that procedures set out the timeframes for making and determining appeals and for providing notification of the outcome of any such appeals and that different periods can be provided for different categories of appeal.  Again, the intention is that none would go beyond 30 days but it would allow for different periods of time and that they would be set by regulation.<\/p><p> There is a provision that an appeals committee may refuse to determine an appeal in certain circumstances.  One is if it is vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process while another is where the appeals committee has attempted to have a facilitation, there have been attempts to facilitate parties or subsequent steps have been taken by the parties and, in particular circumstances, the committee feels the appeal should not be considered further, that is, where there has been an effort to try to find a solution, that has been exhausted and there is no point in a further appeal and it cannot be proceeded with.  If an appeal has not been made within the timeframe determined, for example, and if it is late, it can be refused.<\/p><p> There is a provision whereby the appeals committee can rule that a child must be admitted but it is not within its remit to recommend a change in the admissions policy of the school.  However, it can comment on the lack of clarity of the school's admission policy.  Section 29 is not trying the admissions policy of the school itself.  The admissions policy must comply with this Bill.<\/p><p> The other significant element here is the introduction of compellability so that where an appeal has been allowed, the school must admit the student, readmit the student or adjust the ranking of the student on the waiting list.  Those are the sort of provisions that are being set out in this amending section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#J01000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498663800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&quot;Amendment of section 30 of Act of 1998<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>7. <\/b>Section 30 of the Education Act 1998 is amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):&quot;(2A) In order to afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, regardless of religion, ethnicity or family background, and to uphold their constitutional rights under Articles 44.2.3 and 44.2.4&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) religious instruction and faith formation relating to or arising from the characteristic ethos of the school will take place as a discrete lesson at the end of the school day, and<br \/><br \/>(b) religious instruction and faith formation relating to or arising from the characteristic ethos of the school shall not take place at any other time during the school day and shall not imbue or permeate<br \/><br \/>education at any other time during the school day.&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#K00500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498663800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, Deputy Shortall is not a member of the committee and has no vote.

I should very clearly say that the catchment area proposal is Fianna F&aacute;il's preferred approach and we are not entirely convinced of the Minister's reasons for not doing it but I am willing to look at what the Minister is proposing and to examine it.  I think it will require the committee to examine it with stakeholders as well because it is not a proposal that has received examination so far.  The fact that I am not pursuing my catchment area proposals today does not mean that they are not Fianna F&aacute;il policy.

Basically, what we are providing for here is that every school must have in its admission policy a statement that relates back to the equality legislation so that it has to provide that it will not discriminate on grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation and so on.  That includes the Traveller community grounding of a student.  It provides that the school must have a statement that states that it does not discriminate on the grounds of someone being a Traveller.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops a school giving priority to the Traveller community.  Therefore, it is our view that the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  A school is perfectly entitled to give priority to a Traveller if that is what the school chooses to do.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops that.<\/p> <p>  In the case of homelessness, it is slightly different in that homelessness is not a category in the equality legislation at the moment, but again there is nothing to stop a school providing in this area.  The equality legislation does not contain any ground relating to the housing status of a person.  However, amendment No. 12 appears to require a school to state that it does not discriminate under equality legislation on that ground.  Having regard to amendment No. 83, I do not think the amendment as worded is necessarily what the Deputy is trying to achieve.

We had to completely overhaul the system, close it down for a period and create a new system.  That resulted automatically each year in an extra couple of thousand children and families accessing it.<\/p> <p>  My recollection is that the Department of Education and Skills traditionally does not particularly recognise behavioural disorders.  The test on the social protection side is broadly does the child require care and attention that is very different from the norm.  Also, in that case, quite a number of parents, if they are parenting full-time, would go on to qualify for carer's allowance, but in terms of the school provisions, the approach of the Department of Education and Skills, from my experience, is far more restrictive.  Does this measure cater for children who have been accepted in terms of the domiciliary care allowance?  It may well be that they will be accepted into mainstream classes in the school because, for instance, they have a physical disability which can be addressed and catered for within the mainstream.<\/p><p>What I am specifically interested in is the child with severe behavioural disorders.

Over 60% of children with special needs are accommodated in mainstream classes.  In terms of policy, the NCSE advises on what is the most appropriate setting for them.  As I said, almost two thirds of children with special needs are in mainstream classes which are deemed to be the most appropriate settings.  Where it is established that the needs of a child are such that a special unit is required, that provision is made.  We have doubled the number of places in that regard in the space of five years.  There are now 1,200 special units in schools and the level of provision is growing rapidly on foot of NCSE identifying a need.<\/p> <p>  As indicated by Deputy Thomas Byrne and others, the Department now has the power to compel a school, after a process, to provide a special unit where it is deemed by the NCSE to be necessary for children in the area.  The NCSE, not the Department, advises on the best accommodation for a child, with or without a domiciliary care allowance.

Taken literally, this means that a school cannot discriminate based on the disability, or lack of, of a child presenting.  The default position, if the amendment is not made, is that if a school has a special class reserved for children with particular needs, it cannot protect the places for children with these needs.  That would be a very strange provision.  Essentially, a school protecting a special education place for a child with special educational needs would be acting in a discriminatory manner.  I do not think any one of us would want to see that position being provided for in legislation.  I am not saying it is a phenomenon.  We are providing that the admissions statement must set out these principles.  In terms of what it might mean, it is a possible unintended consequence.  Following on from the concerns expressed by schools providing special classes, the decision was taken to correct the position by way of amendment.  We need to ensure there is reasonable protection where special provision is made for the purposes intended.  There is no ulterior motive involved.  People have raised a concern that a child presenting who is on the spectrum provided for and has a lot of other needs might be denied a place on the basis that some of them are not included in the list.

A school could say in a particular year that it has only ten Catholics because there are a lot of Muslem people and non-religious people so to maintain the proportion, as it would see it, of Catholic students it would start refusing people even though the school is not oversubscribed.

Where a school is undersubscribed this reasoning has no place.  The ethos of a school is already protected elsewhere, in the Education Act.  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPMSA, made the case first that there are very few cases of oversubscription where the baptism barrier comes in, but there are examples of it in my constituency.  Even it would state there are no cases where a school is undersubscribed that somebody should be refused on the basis of religion.  I do not see how anybody would support that as long, of course, as the ethos is protected, which I understand it is anyway.

We tabled amendment No. 23 which, surprisingly to me and I may get an explanation later from the officials, has been ruled out of order.  We reference catchment in the amendment because it is the essential point.  The point about all of this discussion is if in the catchment area there is very large demand for places and there is a school of religious denomination, of course that school of religious denomination is entitled to serve the ethos of its religionists in so far as it is required to maintain the ethos of the school.  This is set out in the Constitution.  However, this does not mean the school can have such a wide catchment area that the children living across the road from the school can be denied a place while children from very far and wide are accepted for a place.  This is what the baptism barrier is about and it is the point the Minister is seeking to duck.  It is a balance between preserving and ensuring the ethos of a school and allowing children in a locality, who may not be of that ethos, to access the school in reasonable numbers without preventing the school from preserving its ethos.  Both of these are addressed in the Constitution.  This is what the Labour Party legislation, which the Minister decided to deep-freeze for a year, set out to achieve.  I do not understand, given all of the various amendments which have been accepted, why amendment No. 23 has been ruled out of order.  The Minister's section does not mention catchment.

If that is tested, it would be heard by the Workplace Relations Commission because it now deals with equality cases.

We need to bring forward proposals that have been approved by the Attorney General and that respect the constitutional right of the religious to organise their affairs and so on.

Setting aside amendment No. 15, which I will come to in a moment, the legislation is not clear in its execution of its own intent.  That is the very specific point I am making.  That is what we are dealing with.  The Minister stated that the legislation would not allow for discrimination on religious grounds where there was not oversubscription.  I do not believe there should be any discrimination and I will come onto that point shortly.  However, even if that is the Minister's intent, the legislation does not make it clear.  It leaves the door open for discrimination in cases where there is not oversubscription because it does not spell it out clearly.  I think the drafters need to look at it because it leaves this open.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 15, which I did not realise we had moved on to, this is where I disagree with Deputy Burton.  The Labour Party approach to this is a fudge between allowing some discrimination to continue but minimising it somewhat with the issue of catchment.  However, there is the problem of how to define a catchment.  As Deputy Burton rightly pointed out, one can expand the concept of catchment to anywhere so how is catchment to be defined?  It is problematic to define it in any sort of meaningful or legal way.  Therefore, I think the only way to deal with the issue is to delete the offending discrimination which is contained in section 61(2)(b), which echoes the wording of the infamous section 7(3)(c).<\/p> <p>  It is worth stating the irrationality of the wording of section 61(2)(b), which reads: \"a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit\".  What the legislation is saying is that it is not discrimination to discriminate.  It is just bonkers.  It is so Irish, it is unbelievable.  It is not discrimination to prefer one group over another on a religious basis.  That is the definition of discrimination.  Nowhere else could do this, except some sort of tin-pot dictatorship.  It is Orwellian wording - freedom is slavery; war is peace; discrimination is not discrimination.  That is what we are proposing to put into law.<\/p><p>That is what we are proposing to put in law.  It is already in the Equal Status Act and now we are going to repeat it in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which purports to be reforming the problems in equal admission to school but is actually restating an Orwellian form of discrimination and trying to claim it is not discrimination or is somehow acceptable.  It is totally wrong.<br\/><br\/>I restate that it is unnecessary to do this, never mind that it is actually wrong to do this to children of all people.  I have made that point already, but who is the Minister doing this for?  I presume he has read the survey of Equate, which is campaigning on this issue.  The survey, which was done scientifically by a proper surveying organisation, shows that 71% or an overwhelming majority of parents, whether religious, non-religious or of minority religions, state the law should be changed so that baptism can no longer be a requirement for school admission in State-funded schools.  Another 12% state that they do not care.  Only 16% want to retain the <i>status quo<\/i>that the Minister is retaining.  In this legislation, the Minister is pandering to 16% over the vast majority.  Why is he doing this?  I do not understand it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has continued to refer to constitutional issues.  I really want to get to the bottom of this, and I should have asked earlier, but at one point the Taoiseach and the Minister claimed the Government had legal advice about the constitutional difficulties involved in removing this discriminatory element of the law.  I have asked repeatedly if we can see the legal advice the Government received, but we have never seen it.  I do not believe the Minister has legal advice.  That was spoof from the Taoiseach.  In my opinion, it was &quot;the man with two pints&quot; talk.  We have heard it only as a spurious justification for maintaining an utterly discriminatory law directed disgracefully against children.  Could the Minister answer that point?  How can he justify it?  Why does he feel the need to do it when he is pandering to a tiny minority of the population?  Where is the famous legal advice about the constitutional problem that might be involved in removing this discrimination from the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#P02600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Catherine Martin wish to comment further because we will be dealing with the amendments after the Minister has spoken?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#Q00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#Q00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The position, as we discussed earlier, is that we are not changing the Equal Status Act here.

An amendment which provides that such schools do not discriminate within the meaning of the Equal Status Act is not appropriate.  There is no provision in that Act and any amendment that proposes to amend the definition of discrimination within that Act would have to be made within the Act itself.  The difficulty with the school making a statement that it is not discrimination would not change the parent Act.  The parent Act does not deal with language as a grounds for discrimination.  Under this Bill, Irish medium schools are not prohibited from prioritising children from Irish-speaking homes.  None of the amendments I am bringing forward today will prohibit schools from doing so.<\/p> <p>  I am aware, however, that there are concerns that some provisions in the Bill could have a bearing on the manner or mechanism by which a school would ascertain that a student is from an Irish-speaking home.  Some schools, for example, meet or undertake an assessment of the student, in some cases the parents or in some cases both students and parents to ascertain whether Irish is in fact the language spoken at home.  In the context of this Bill, such an approach raises a number of issues.  The overall reach and approach of this Bill is to prohibit priority based on the academic ability, skill or aptitude of the student or parent.  It is consistent with long-standing education policy that the academic capacity, aptitude or skills of a child or his or her parents should never have a bearing on whether a child is admitted to a school.  It is for that reason that entrance tests were explicitly banned back in 1993 by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach.<\/p> <p>  I assure the committee that the Government and I wish to support and promote the Irish language and Irish medium schools as far as possible.  I am, therefore, open to supporting such schools to prioritise children from Irish-speaking homes, where the schools are oversubscribed.  There are, however, complexities involved with ensuring that any mechanism through which they do so is fair and does not serve to exclude children of lesser academic ability or those with special educational needs.  Such a mechanism must also take due account of the general desirability that public policy and law should ensure that no child is excluded from a school based on his or her family or socioeconomic background.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, both policy and legal questions arise in defining what an Irish-speaking home is.  Does it apply where one parent is a fluent speaker but the other parent is not?  Does Irish have to be the exclusive language of the house?  Are bilingual families covered?  How can that be provided for in law?  These are complex issues, both legally and in terms of policy.

This amendment also includes a reference to the admission policy of a school, providing that it shall admit each student seeking admission to a special class in the school, other than in the case of the circumstances set out in section 62(6)(c).  The amendment also reflects more accurately the language used in section 23(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act which provides that a parent is only required to confirm his or her acceptance of the code of behaviour when requested to do so by the principal of the school.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 provides that the admission policy section of the Bill contains a list of the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria and any exemption from same.  The following are the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria: a student's prior attendance at a preschool, with exemptions for early intervention and early start preschools; the payment of fees or contributions; a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, except for the admission of students to a special school or special class where it is necessary in order to ascertain whether the student has the category of special educational needs for which the special school or special class has been established to cater; the occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude of a student's parents; and a requirement that a student, or his or her parents, attend an interview, open day or other meeting as a condition of admission, other than in the case of admission to the residential element of a boarding school or to a course known as a post-leaving certificate course.  The Bill is silent on a limitation on the power of a school to determine a priority for children of past pupils where it is oversubscribed either by setting a percentage or otherwise.  It was previously considered that this matter could be dealt with in regulations but, following legal advice, it is clear the matter needs to be dealt with in primary legislation.<\/p><p>The amendment provides that a school may not provide priority based on a student's connection to it by virtue of a member of his or her family attending or h0aving previously attended the school, except where a sibling of the student is attending or has attended the school, or where a parent or grandparent of the student concerned has previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to the latter criterion does not exceed 25% of the available places as set out in the school's annual admission notice for the school year concerned.<\/p><p>The amendment also provides that a school may not provide priority based on the date on which an application for admission was received by the school, subject to the application being received at any time during the period specified for receiving applications set out in the annual admission notice of the school for the school year concerned or, where appropriate, at any time during the period as otherwise determined by the school in accordance with the Bill or regulations made under it.  An exemption from this provision is given where, prior to the coming into operation of the subsection, the school had confirmed in writing to the person who had made an application or expression of interest that the name of the child in respect of whom the application or expression of interest had been made had been placed on a list maintained by the school for the purpose of allocating school places in the year concerned.  This exemption ceases to apply five years after commencement of the subsection.<\/p><p>The amendment also provides that a school shall compile a waiting list of students whose applications for the intake group were unsuccessful following application of the oversubscription selection criteria and this list shall remain valid for the intake year.  Students will be placed on the list in accordance with the order of priority assigned to their applications after the school has applied its selection criteria and it must offer further school places that become available for and during the school year to those students on the waiting list, in accordance with the order of priority in which they had been placed on the list.<\/p><p>The amendment also seeks to address somewhat the concerns raised by a number of the education partners about the practice of parents applying to multiple schools.  It provides that, in accepting an offer of admission, an applicant shall indicate if he or she has accepted an offer of admission from another school or schools or if the applicant is awaiting the outcome of the admission process in another school or schools.  If so, he or she shall provide details of the offer or offers or the school or schools concerned.  An offer of admission may not be made or may be withdrawn where the applicant does not comply with this provision.<\/p><p>The amendment amends the existing wording in the Bill which provides that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's policy on its arrangements for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This provision has been amended to provide that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's arrangements for any student where the parent of that student or, in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student himself or herself has requested that he or she attend the school without attending religious instruction.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a consequential amendment required to change the reference to the subparagraphs in section 62 which now run from (a) to (q).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#W02200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 86 included in this grouping?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#W02400","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#W02500","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>It is my amendment.

I had direct experience of this in the past in my constituency.  I wish to be clear that the amendment does not suggest there be a prohibition on children of staff members enrolling in a school in which their parents are teaching.

As the Deputy explained, the amendment would prohibit schools from prioritising the children of staff or board members.  I believe it is a reasonable position that an oversubscribed school may give priority to children of staff members, where it so wishes.  For example, from the perspective of facilitating those families, it is sensible that a teacher who works in a school distant from his or her home can have his or her children attend the school rather than having to make arrangements for them to attend elsewhere.  I have not come across this as a widely prevalent practice.  If it has been used, it does not appear to be having a big impact on admissions policy, but, obviously, the Deputy has evidence to the contrary.<\/p><p>If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary and he gives me the details of that I will consider the issue and come back on Report Stage to see if it would be appropriate to deal with it.

It is not reasonable that it is a perk for teachers only, but I will respond to what the Minister has asked me.

That one in four pupils could have this right just because he or she happens to be the grandson or granddaughter of a past pupil is bizarre, wrong and unfair.

It is actually reducing the extent to which schools can engage in the practice.  They did not face a restriction before.  The empirical evidence is that the higher ceilings have applied in schools in which it is the custom and practice.  This measure is restricting some schools in giving priority to the children of past pupils.  It is trying to introduce a ceiling.<\/p> <p>  On the question of why any child should be allowed, the argument is based on the fact that many schools have a tradition whereby past pupils want to send their children to them.  They may have played for the same GAA club or have associations with the parish which they may want to keep for one reason or another.  Schools have facilitated family continuity in terms of being part of the school community.  They often draw members of boards of management and so on from these very involved families.  The provision is trying to strike a balance.  School communities are complex networks and many schools draw their support from past pupils.  It is very understandable they would try to maintain a connection with past pupils.  This is a way by which that connection has been maintained.  It is reasonable to argue that there should be a limit set on the extent to which what I describe would become a practice.  That is why I believe this is a reasonable solution.

The approach to the Bill is to provide for the option of regulating where it is necessary and proportionate.  This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity whereby decision-making is with the board and patron as far as possible.  A fundamental feature of our school system is that the governance and management of a school is within the control of the board of management.  As a general approach, this Bill seeks to maintain and support this position and to only interfere with the board&rsquo;s authority to determine and manage the admission of pupils to its school where this is necessary.  While regulations will undoubtedly be put in place for some aspects of admission and over time the aspects that require regulation may change, it is not necessarily the case that the Minister should regulate on all matters set out in this section.  I am also cognisant of the need to ensure that regulations would not make the admission process overly complex or burdensome for either parents or schools.  It is important to note that this section requires the Minister to consult with the various stakeholders specified before regulating.  If the Minister was required to regulate in the manner suggested, then he or she may not be in a position to properly respond to the views expressed through that consultation particularly where there is a clear consensus that a particular aspect of admission does not require any regulatory intervention.  Accordingly, it is preferable that this section gives the Minister flexibility to regulate when and where it is necessary to do so and on those specific matters or issues on which regulation is at any given time required.  This is the more appropriate approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB01800","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498663800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 53 is in the name of Deputy Nolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB02000","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, line 37, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB02100","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 53 agreed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB02200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB02300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Can I call a vote?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#BB02400","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Yes, of course.

It sets down the procedure to be followed by the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency for designating a special needs child to a school.  Included in this is an appeals process where the school may appeal against this decision.<\/p> <p>  The Bill has only two grounds where a school may successfully appeal such a decision.  These are where the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency fail to follow correct procedures or where the child's religion is not compatible with that of the religious ethos of the school concerned.  The school can prove that it needs to refuse admission on the basis of maintaining that ethos.  The amendment I have put forward would remove the second ground for appeal.<\/p> <p>  The Minister proposes to amend the Bill to delete this second ground.  Amendment No. 110 would, however, have the same effect as it sets down that the agency, in making a decision to designate, must have regard to the admissions policies of schools in the locality.  This would appear to be a backdoor way of doing the same thing and allowing that discrimination on the grounds of religion.  If that is the case, that makes for poor law.  It is unacceptable because it would favour religious ethos over the rights of that special needs child.  This should have no place in our legislation and it is very hard to defend on any grounds.<\/p> <p>  In the case of children with special needs, we are all too familiar with the difficulties they have in accessing schools and with schools not being prepared to make provision for them to the extent that they should.  The idea that a child who is already disadvantaged due to special needs could be further disadvantaged by being refused on the grounds of religious ethos is an act of double discrimination.  I am open to correction on this but that is my interpretation of what is proposed in amendment No. 110.

We feel the council must have regard to the school that is in the best interests of the child to attend.  I have no problem with that in principle.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 100, tabled by Deputy Martin, the Bill already provides the council must have regard to the school's ability to accommodate the child.  The amendment proposed would reword this to refer to the school's ability to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child.  I consider the current wording, referring simply to the school's ability, is adequate and takes account of the fact this will depend on the school in question.  Inserting the proposed wording might cause confusion about this provision and potentially dilute its meaning.<\/p> <p>  I wish to point out, with regard to amendments Nos. 113 and 124, that the Bill applies to recognised schools only.  It does not apply to schools that are not funded or recognised by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Such a non-recognised school should not, therefore, be designated under this section.  Accordingly, amendments proposing that these particular provisions of the Bill be confined to schools that are not aided by the Department, in other words, non-recognised schools, do not make sense in the context of a Bill that does not apply to non-recognised schools.  I therefore do not accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 115 and 126 relate to a parental appeal, and it must be pointed out that the designation powers in the section are targeted at very specific situations.  They are aimed at children who have no school place at all, including where their parents have tried and failed across many schools to secure a school place for their child.  These provisions are not about ensuring parents in those circumstances get their preferred school or school of first choice.  The provisions give the council or the agency, as applicable, a power of last resort which can be used after a child has been refused access to many schools.  These provisions are not about creating new places in schools that are already full, nor are they about ensuring that the preferred school of choice is designated.  Where a school is designated for a child, the school is required to admit that child.  There is no corresponding compulsion on the parent to avail of the place in the designated school.  The parent may yet decide to pursue other applications or appeals under section 29.  It is, however, appropriate that there would be an appeal process for the designated school as the school is being compelled to admit the child.  A school could be designated, even where it has already lawfully refused the child and an appeal decision under section 29 has upheld that decision.  Therefore, it is reasonable that a school would have a final opportunity to appeal when such a significant interference in its affairs is in question.  It should be noted that an appeal will only be upheld where the appeals committee is satisfied that the agency or council, as applicable, has not complied with the requirements of this section or where the school has established that the decision of the agency or council is unreasonable.<\/p> <p>  Under this section, parents can appeal where the agency or council has failed or refused to make a designation.  It must also be noted that the agency or council under the Bill must have regard to the wishes of the parents and the school that, in the view of the agency or council, is in the best interests of the child concerned.  However, I do not consider that there should be an appeal on whether the school that has been designated is the preferred school for the parents.  For these reasons I do not accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, all propose to delete the provision allowing a designation to be cancelled where a school has proved that the refusal to admit the child is essential to maintain the ethos of the school as provided for by section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  I have provided for this provision to be removed as already outlined.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 147 defines \"all reasonable efforts\" by a parent and I do not consider that such an amendment is appropriate.  It will be a matter for the agency, council or appeals committee concerned to determine whether a parent has made such efforts.  The agency or council must itself also have regard to the interests of the child and the availability of places locally.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Shortall raised the question about the amendment which inserted the words, \"must have regard to the admissions policy\".  This is to look at issues such as the gender of the school and that a requirement would not be imposed on, for example, an all-girls school.  The overriding situation is that the best interests of the child is what will be served but this is a factor the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, would bear in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#HH00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>If the best interests of the child applied we would not have discrimination on religious grounds.  It is not any consolation this might be the case.  The Minister has already spelled out he has deleted the grounds on which places can be refused relating to section 7(3)(c).  My point is that having deleted this, the Minister's amendment seeking to reference the admissions policy of schools in the locality will restore that provision because the admissions policy of the schools in the locality allows them to discriminate on religious grounds.  It is often very hard for children with special needs to get into mainstream schools, particularly their local mainstream school.  In a situation where the parents were not able to locate or source a school and the council or the Child and Family Agency designates a school as being suitable and states it is the school suitable for the child who has special needs, the idea the school could then appeal this on the grounds of religion, and that a child with special needs not subscribing to the same religious beliefs would undermine the ethos of the school, seems shocking.  Many schools are very good at welcoming children with special needs, but some schools go out of their way to not take children with special needs.  This provides grounds for refusing a place to a special needs child where a school has already been designated as the most suitable school for the child but a child with special needs will then be expected to jump another hurdle.  Acceptance of the amendment, whereby the admissions policy of schools in the locality would apply, means if a school has a policy of refusal on the grounds of religion then a special needs child can be refused on the grounds of religion.  While on the one hand the Minister has removed those grounds, on the other hand he is replacing them with the general provision of the admissions policy of schools in the locality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017062800002#HH00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1498663800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I completely agree with Deputy Shortall on amendment No. 98 and I believe it will lead to further discrimination.

The whole purpose of the grouping is to seek to clarify that the Bill applies to a wider group of disputes rather than only those in which civil proceedings have been issued.  We feel that the use of the word &quot;proceedings&quot; is likely to cause confusion for the public and for the mediators themselves and could give rise to a belief that in order for the protections of the Bill to apply, proceedings will have had to have been issued.  It is to try to clarify some of those points.  I know the Minister has tabled amendment No. 3 to change the definition of proceedings to civil proceedings that may be initiated before a court.  What I am asking the Minister to clarify here is that this amendment means that the Bill applies to any dispute in which there is a potential to litigate, that the proceedings do not have had to have been issued.  Could he clarify that in the context of this amendment and what kinds of disputes he thinks would be excluded from the provision?  Notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, the argument remains that for the avoidance of doubt in the public's mind, a &quot;dispute&quot; is better than &quot;proceedings&quot;.  It heads off any potential confusion.  This is a critically important Bill as far as we are concerned.  We want to encourage people to use mediation as an alternative to court.<\/p><p>We do not want people thinking it has to go through the courts process.  There are situations in which this could cause irrevocable damage, for example, a dispute between neighbours.  If somebody starts litigation it is very hard to come back from that and go into a mediation process.  We want people to know they can get to mediation before the issue goes to court and that they can have an early intervention to de-escalate things.  In that sense, I think \"dispute\" is a better word.  I know Deputy Wallace has \"dispute\" rather than my wording, which is \"civil dispute\".  I am open to that argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#A00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":769,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly.

I acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, on this legislation.  I hope we can advance matters today and set a date for future progress also.<\/p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill and Second Stage discussions, my Department received a number of submissions on scope-related issues.  It was felt by some that section 3 was so structured as to create an impression that the Bill would apply only to civil proceedings and not to disputes which had not reached the stage of proceedings.  That, of course, is not the intention.  My Department has held discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Courts Service and mediation groups, including the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, in an effort to find a wording that would ensure the Bill&rsquo;s provisions would apply to disputes in the civil law arena.  I believe we can reach accommodation on the issues raised by Deputy Daly in her amendment.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 3, I propose to replace the definition of proceedings in section 2 in order to remove the reference to section 3 and to make it clear that \"proceedings\" means \"civil proceedings which can be instituted before a court\".  Using that phrasing will resolve the issue raised by Deputy Daly.  In amendment No. 5, I propose to delete section 3(1), which specified that the Bill applied to any civil proceedings.  The title of the section will be changed to \"Scope\" instead of \"Application\".

We note the Mediators' Institute of Ireland was concerned that if the confidential nature of mediation was to be in any way undermined, parties to a dispute would be less likely to use mediation as a process to resolve their dispute.  It is probably necessary to include references to confidentiality in the definition of mediation and also to extend confidentiality to third party participants and oral communications.  It has been recommended by the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, the Law Reform Commission and the Law Society that a reference to confidentiality be included in the statutory definition of mediation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#B01200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>This is a must-have amendment for us.  The bedrock of mediation is trust.  That is going to be undermined if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  Parties may not be willing to speak openly if there is a risk that some of the material could be used later in potential litigation.  The whole purpose of mediation is to resolve disputes through an open forum.<\/p> <p>  The Mediators' Institute of Ireland points out that communications between parties made with the intent of settling judicial proceedings have traditionally been protected by the courts and by common law in terms of the \"without prejudice\" privilege.  Statements contained in a document marked \"without prejudice\" or made verbally on that basis in a genuine attempt to settle a dispute cannot be used to undermine a person later on.  This process is about trying to avoid litigation.  If the parties are genuinely trying to resolve a dispute, they need that protection.  It is there anyway in court proceedings.  It is important to say that \"without prejudice\" privilege also has limitations.  The party relying on it must show that the dispute existed at the time of the communication and that legal proceedings had commenced or the communication was in contemplation of litigation.  It is not enough that the communication concerns a matter in dispute for the privilege to be upheld.  There must an indication of settling the dispute in that sense.<\/p> <p>  There is a well-accepted value to confidentiality in the resolution of disputes and it has to be spelled out in these provisions if we are to woo people away from the courts into an alternative channel.  The Law Society of Ireland, Law Reform Commission and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland all say this is fundamental and I think it has to go into the body of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#B01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.

At present, section 8 holds that &quot;the mediator shall, prior to the commencement of the mediation ... furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes&quot;.  Therefore, it is proposed that mediators be able basically to write something on the back of a napkin as long as they say it is their code of practice.  My first amendment seeks to place an obligation on the mediators to subscribe to a single code of practice, changing &quot;any&quot; to &quot;the&quot;.<\/p><p>My second amendment is linked with this in that it provides that all mediators' codes of practice &quot;shall incorporate in full ... the code of practice prepared and published [by the Minister] under <i>section 9<\/i>&quot;.  During Second Stage debate on the Bill, even Government backbenchers made the point that there is no point in the Minister publishing a code of practice for the conduct of mediators only for mediators not to be obliged to follow it.  It does not make any sense.  In this sense, section 9 is undermined by section 8 in that mediators do not have to sign up to the code of practice and, therefore, all of the good aspirations in section 9(2) about ethical standards being observed and continuing professional development can basically be junked by a mediator who is empowered to design his or her own code if he or she so wishes.  Given that we were discussing in the House last week the regulation of other professional bodies, we need regulation here, and the mediators themselves want it.<\/p><p>I note that the Law Society said it was very disappointed that proportionate and appropriate regulation of mediators has not been given a statutory basis in this Bill.  Any amendments to do so would probably be outside the scope of the Bill at this stage.  It is particularly against this backdrop that I urge the Minister to accepts these amendments.  My amendment No. 23 is an effort to plug the gap in this regard pending full statutory regulation.  These amendments, if accepted, would at least require mediators to sign up to a code of practice with certain crucial provisions set by the Minister and would require that the code of practice also incorporate training requirements for mediators, a provision that is absent from the Bill at present.  Without this, I believe we are heading into very dangerous territory.  It leaves people seriously exposed to ending up potentially in the hands of rogue operators to be exploited, which we absolutely do not want.  This is important and, as I said, even Government backbenchers made this point during the Second Stage debate.  Amendment No. 15 is linked into this in that it places an obligation on the Minister to prepare and publish or cause to be prepared or published a code of practice for mediators.  At present, it is only an option for the Minister, which is not good enough.  It should be a requirement.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 20, 22, 23 and 25 are another little grouping within this grouping and, again, they seek to tighten things up regarding the code of practice.  At present, the code of practice the Minister may draw up may include provisions concerning continuing professional development, ethical standards to be observed, the determination of costs and fees and so on.  What we seek to do with this amendment is to place an obligation on the Minister to include all of these provisions, but not just these provisions.  It can go broader than them.  The amendment does not limit the Minister to these provisions but it does oblige him to deal with them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 23 obliges the Minister to include education and training requirements for mediators in this regard as well.  This grouping, obliging the Minister to put certain things into the code of practice, is very reasonable and I believe it is supported by the profession itself.  Against the backdrop of our trying to professionalise many of these standards, the grouping is more than welcome.  In deference to amendment No. 23, my amendment No. 25 then seeks to remove the item in the list of things to be included in the code of practice regarding procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation.  I am seeking to remove this on the assumption that amendment No. 23 will be accepted.  We would be tying the hands of mediators too much if we were to keep that line in the context of the other provisions I mentioned.  We do not want to micromanage what mediators do in primary legislation, and that is not the intention of these amendments, but the option is always there for the Minister to include recommended procedures to be followed.  However, requiring mediators to sign up to procedures that must be followed in primary legislation is too much.  That can be dealt with by statutory regulation.  The aim is to try to overcome some of the shortcomings in the mediators' code of practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#D01600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Five of the 16 amendments are in the Minister's name, namely, amendments Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, and No. 26.

As regards section 8, I am unable to accept amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in the name of Deputy Daly.  Amendment No. 12 proposes to amend section 8(1)(c) in a manner which would require a mediator to furnish the client with a code of practice which would not only incorporate a code of practice published under section 9 but could also incorporate additional unspecified terms.  While the amendment provides that any such additional terms should not conflict with the content of the code of practice under section 9 it is difficult to see how this could operate in an effective manner in practice.  It would present practical difficulties and so I am unable to support it.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 also seek to amend section 8(1)(c) by substitution of the word &quot;any&quot; with &quot;the&quot;, but that implies that there can be only one code of practice for mediators.  That might present a difficulty.  There may be more than one code of practice for mediators depending, perhaps, on the subject matter of a dispute which might be going to mediation.  For example, amendments 16 to 19, inclusive, to section 9 while mainly technical in nature contains a proposal for the development of a code of practice dealing with the involvement of children in mediation.  I see a potential conflict in what is proposed by Deputy Daly, although I do not believe it is intended.  To amend section 8(1)(c) in the manner proposed would not have the effect sought by Deputy Daly and it could, in fact, be unduly problematic.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 also seeks to require a mediator to furnish to a client a code of practice which would incorporate a code of practice published under section.  I am unable to accept this amendment for the reasons already outlined in regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment.  <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, are technical in nature.  They relate to the possibility of there being more than one code of practice for mediators.  This must be acknowledged.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 26 proposes the insertion of a new provision allowing a code of practice to contain details of procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of a mediation involving consultation by a mediator with a child.  This amendment follows on from a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation regarding the voice of the child.  The commission recommended that where a mediator considers it appropriate to involve a child directly in a mediation, the mediator must obtain the consent of the child and must provide adequate facilities for that specific and special purpose.  My Department has discussed the manner in which this recommendation could be progressed with the Legal Aid Board and the Mediators&rsquo; Institute of Ireland and the consensus reached was that the best way to achieve the objective is to ensure that the voice of the child is included in a code of practice made under the Act.  <\/p><p>The intention behind amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Daly is, I believe, to make it mandatory for the Minister to prepare and publish a code of practice for mediators.  I cannot accept this amendment as it ignores the possibility, specifically provided for in section 9(1)(b), that the Minister may approve a code of practice prepared by a person other than the Minister which purports to set standards for the conduct of mediators.  I believe that possibility must be preserved.<\/p><p>In regard to amendments Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, the intention appears to be to ensure that a code of practice must include all the matters outlined at paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>f<\/i>) in subsection (2).  However, as I have already indicated, there is likely to be more than one code of practice and it would not be appropriate to impose such a restriction.  It is quite likely there will be more than one code of practice and these amendments do not allow for that possibility.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek to insert into a code of practice provisions regarding education and training for mediators.  I do not believe that a code of practice for mediators is the correct place to deal with training and education standards and I note that codes of practice for mediators in other jurisdictions do not include provisions for education and training.  I am not saying that education and training provisions are in any way at variance with the role and function of mediators but I do not believe that putting that in a code of practice is appropriate.<\/p><p>I cannot accept Amendment 25 from Deputy Daly which would have the effect of removing procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation from the scope of a code of practice.  I acknowledge what the Deputy had to say about this  being dependent on other amendments.  Amendment No. 25 as it stands, to my mind, would run completely counter to what a code of practice should do and, therefore, I cannot accept it.<\/p><p>I would ask Deputies to consider what I have said and to reflect on the Bill in its entirety with the Committee Stage amendments following which we can look at what might be done on Report Stage.  In regard to all of the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly I see potential difficulties, many of which are perhaps unintended but would nevertheless cause difficulties in practice.  I do not believe anyone is keen to have a Bill that might be regarded as anything less than certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#E00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I accept the point regarding amendment No. 12 and I bow to the cleaner version set out in amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Daly.

The points listed for inclusion in the code of practice are good but there is too much scope to avoid what should be fundamental requirements for a code of practice.  The change from \"may\" to \"shall\" is a change from optional to a mandatory provisions for the code of practice.  I am of the view that these provisions should be mandatory.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 24, there should be a minimum requirement in terms of education and training for a person to be a mediator otherwise a situation is created whereby mediators who have completed a short course can be placed on the same level as already professionally qualified mediators with hundreds of hours of training.  That might not be such a good idea.  The Bill as it stands will allow those who undertake significant ongoing education to be equated with those who do not refresh and update their mediation skills and education.

It could potentially be a really important thing for citizens, but it has to be done right.  Done right it would be brilliant, but done wrong it could cause a huge amount of damage.  The Bill is full of aspirations about a code of practice but there is no meat behind it.  There is nothing to require that to be drawn up and there is nothing to require the mediator to sign up to it.  As the Bill is currently constructed, somebody could go and do an online diploma course, put \"association of professional mediators\" or whatever beside his or her name, hand over the code of practice and then be on exactly the same level playing field as somebody who has been highly trained, who has upskilled and who has done it all.

With regard to our amendments Nos. 13 and 14, we are talking about certain minimum standards.  The Minister said that there would be different codes of practice and all that.  That may absolutely be the case.  However, what we are saying is that for somebody to have the label of mediator, they must require certain minimum standards.  What is the point in talking about a code of practice if people do not have to adhere to it?  Not only that, but the Minister may do some of these things.  We might have confidence that this Minister will do them, but there is no requirement on a Minister to bring about some of these things.  Again, I say that in the context of the likes of the Law Society stating that the regulation of what will be a new, important and growing profession of mediators should be dealt with on a statutory basis.  It cannot be done fully by the legislation as it stands.  Our amendments are just trying to plug the gap pending the statutory regulation of it.  It is not about micromanaging and it is not about dotting every \"i\" and all that sort of stuff.  It is about certain minimum standards that mediators must adhere to in order to give themselves that title.

My preference would be for the former.  If we start going down the road of mediators having a series of codes of practice, we would end up like boxing associations with different organisations having different codes of practice and people being able to say that they are regulated by the Malahide mediators business or the Rathmines mediators association.<\/p> <p>  The preference should be to have one code of practice.  The Minister said that there is an advantage to having more than one code because, for instance, he may want to develop a code of practice for mediations that involve children.  I do not see why we cannot have just one code of practice and, within that, we would have a section that would deal with mediations that involve children.  Section 9 refers to there being a code of practice.  As Deputies, we have a code of conduct.  We do not have a different code of conduct for different parties or anything like that.  I believe we should be seeking to harmonise this in one code of practice for mediators.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the other amendments about education and training, as I said, we intend to table an amendment to section 9 on Report Stage in respect of the requirement that mediators should have to have a minimum standard of education or training.  I believe that should be put in the Bill.  Otherwise, it will just be open season.  It is not like any other profession in which one has to achieve certain qualifications in order to become qualified to practise.  As Deputy Daly said, under the Bill as it stands anyone can just call themselves a mediator and off they go.  We need to be able to protect them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the code of practice, in court there are the rules of court.  If we want to make mediation a success, which we all want to do, we should have just one code of practice for mediators.

I listened to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, but the fact of the matter is that there are different practices and codes that are required for different areas of practice.  I mentioned just one, which was the matter of children in mediation.  I believe that unduly restricting the Minister in section 9(1) excludes that possibility, which is more than a possibility - it is a likelihood.<\/p><p>I want to make the point again regarding the education and training, which has been mentioned, as well as the qualifications.  I draw the attention of members again to the role of the mediator under section 8(1), with specific reference to 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(c), by which the mediator would be required prior to the commencement of the mediation to<\/p><blockquote>(b) furnish to the parties the following details of the mediator that are relevant to mediation in general or that particular mediation:(i) qualifications;<br \/><br \/>(ii) training and experience;<br \/><br \/>(iii) continuing professional development training,and<br \/><br \/>(c) furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes in so far as mediation is concerned.<\/blockquote> <p>That deals with the matter of qualifications and training and with the issue of experience and expertise and, therefore, I believe it caters for the points being raised by the Deputies in a number of the amendments.<\/p><p>With regard to education and training, I accept the point raised by Deputy Wallace.

I refer to the Schedule of the Bill, which will impose a duty and obligation on the council to maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation, including a system of training, education, professional development and the acquisition of expertise.  I am not against the point Deputy Wallace is making, but I do not think it is appropriate in this part of the Bill and I do not think it is appropriate for this Bill.  Rather, it is a matter for the Mediation Council.  As the Deputy knows, the council will be of consequence in terms of the evolving nature of mediation and the law.

For this purpose, they must provide clients with information on mediation services, including details of mediators, information about the advantages and benefits of mediation, information on the confidentiality obligations, as discussed earlier, and the enforceability of mediation settlements.  Where mediation is declined or fails and court proceedings are instituted on behalf of a client, the application must be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor confirming that these obligations have been discharged in relation to the client and the proceedings to which the declaration relates.<\/p><p>In submissions to my Department, the Law Society has raised the possibility of confusion and duplication of effort in cases arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  The society points out that the requirements of this Bill in relation to the making of a statutory declaration would appear to be in addition to the existing requirements with respect to the signing of a certificate under those Acts.  I accept that there is a possibility of duplication of requirements in these cases and I am tabling amendment No. 32 which disapplies section 14 to certain matters arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.<\/p><p>We need consistency and coherence between the provisions of this Bill and the requirements on solicitors under the Acts of 1964, 1989 and 1996.  For this reason, amendments Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, will, respectively, amend sections 20 and 21 of the 1964 Act, sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act and sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act in order to require a solicitor to make a statutory declaration rather than merely sign a certificate to the effect that the requirements under these Acts have been discharged.<\/p><p>In addition, I consider that the information regarding mediation provided by a solicitor to an applicant under these Acts should mirror the obligations placed on a solicitor under this legislation.  For this reason, the proposed amendments require a solicitor to provide to an applicant under those Acts the names and addresses of persons qualified to provide an appropriate mediation service and to inform his or her client of the matters referred to in sections 10 and 11 of this Bill.<\/p><p>Two further amendments concern section 29 of the 1964 Act and section 43 of the 1996 Act.  Both relate to the costs of mediation or counselling services.  Since the Bill we are now discussing contains specific provision for costs of mediation, these sections should be amended to delete reference to mediation services.

The requirement in the Bill to produce a report which outlines any issues raised, or for the mediator to give an opinion on the engagement of the parties, would breach this confidentiality.  This section is of great concern to the Mediators' Institute of Ireland and the Law Society, and was highlighted in the 2010 report of the Law Reform Commission.  In that report, the Law Reform Commission concluded that mediators' reports, if any, should be narrowly restricted and might have some role in assisting a court in determining a successful litigant's cost application after litigation, subsequent to an inconclusive mediation but not otherwise.  In paragraph 4.125 of the report, the commission concluded that:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he Commission considers that the content of mediators' or conciliators' reports to the Court should be narrowly restricted.  Confidentiality during a mediation session is essential to protect the integrity of the process.  For the mediation or conciliation to be effective, a mediator or conciliator must have the trust of all participants, both in joint sessions and in private caucuses.  Requiring mediators or conciliators to report on the conduct of the parties to the Court imperils the confidentiality of the process.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#H03800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":930,"content":"<p>This is an important group of amendments for us.  As Deputy Wallace said, the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland are all keen that there would be some changes here, in particular with regard to the obligation in this section that mediators provide in their report to the court a statement of their opinion as to whether or not the parties fully engaged.  This is way too subjective.  Only a brief report needs to be presented as to whether or not meditation took place and whether a settlement was reached and, if so, what the terms of that settlement were.<\/p> <p>  It is important we include in the Bill the requirement that the report be a written one.  That comes under amendment No. 33.  Otherwise, we run the risk of much of the mediator's time being spent on court appearances and so on.  A written report to the court, however, should be sufficient.  It should be a neutral summary of the facts.  It is important to include something because in awarding costs the courts can take into account any unreasonable refusal or failure of a party to consider or engage properly in mediation.  I agree with Deputy Wallace's point that the mediator's report should one of advice and for the court decide whether it was unreasonable or not.<\/p><p>A normal statement should be a written statement to the court to be rubber stamped.  That is an important point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#H03900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":932,"content":"<p>It should be a written report and the wording of section 17 implies it would be a written report, so I do not see any harm in stating it will be a written report.  Otherwise, one will not get the detail that is set out in the rest of section 17(1).<\/p> <p>  A further point concerns section 17(1)(b)(iv), which states: \"if no mediation settlement has been reached, a statement as to whether, in the mediator&rsquo;s opinion, the parties engaged fully in the mediation\" will be made.  I believe that will change the character of the mediation and it also changes the character of the mediator.  If that is put in place, the mediator will become an individual who can punish one or other of the parties to a mediation, which I believe undermines the voluntary nature of mediation.  One will find situations where mediators in a report to the courts say one side did not fully engage, and as a result there could be costs consequences against that side in court.  There may also be consequences for the mediator in that the parties may say this was unfair and that they did fully engage, and there may be a dispute in which a mediator is sued.  This makes it difficult and makes it potentially adversarial, which is what we do not want in mediation.  This needs to be looked at again by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062800002#J00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1498636800,"counter":933,"content":"<p>This group of amendments relates to the mediator&rsquo;s report to the court under section 17.  It provides that where the parties decide to engage in mediation following an invitation by the court, and they subsequently apply to the court to re-enter the proceedings, the mediator will prepare and submit a report to the court outlining the outcome of the mediation.  I take the point with regard to having the report in writing.<\/p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill, a number of submissions to my Department queried whether the mediator&rsquo;s report should refer to unresolved matters as currently required by section 17(1)(b)(iii).  I have accepted that it should not be necessary to refer to such &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; issues and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 36 and 38.<\/p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 33 and 34 tabled by Deputy Daly, I am not disposed to accept them as of now but I take the point she makes.  Subsection (1) requires the mediator to prepare and submit a report to the court and this already implies that the report must be written.  Moreover, inserting the words &ldquo;short and neutral&rdquo; in regard to such a report, as proposed in amendment No. 34, is unnecessary since paragraphs (a) and (b) already indicate the content of such a report.<\/p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 35 and 37, tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly respectively, I am willing to give this issue further consideration because I do not believe there is much between us.  The key issue here is the requirement in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that if no mediation settlement has been reached, the mediator&rsquo;s report should contain a statement as to whether the parties engaged fully in the mediation or not.  I recognise that this provision raises sensitive issues for mediators.  Deputies will be aware that a broadly similar provision is already to be found in section 28 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which requires the chairperson of a mediation conference to include in his or her report to the court a statement as to whether the failure of mediation is substantially due to the conduct of one or more of the parties, and in that case specifying the identity of such party or parties.<\/p> <p>  I would ask Members to acknowledge the sensitivities here.  I am willing to give the matter further consideration.  I acknowledge the importance of the points raised in terms of facilitating further discussion and in assisting me to come back on Report Stage with a form of wording that should meet the concerns of Deputies as indicated in amendments Nos. 35 and 37.
