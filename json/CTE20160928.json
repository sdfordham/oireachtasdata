The sound quality is not great at this end either.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that no country in the world has delivered a universal single-tier health care system through the market, for-profit provision or private insurance.  That is because it is in the nature of markets to operate through selection and exclusion.  They transfer risks and costs back to service users and inevitably deny care to those who need it most.  Risk selection and exclusion is built into the design of market bureaucracies.  By contrast, inclusion and redistribution must be built into the systems of public administration for universal health systems.  As we all know, risk selection and risk avoidance mechanisms undermine the goal of access and universality.<br\/><br\/>I would like to refer to the United States, which is the best example of risk selection and risk avoidance at work.  With health expenditure of approximately 18% of GDP, the US denies more than one in five of its population access to health care.  A report from the Institute of Medicine has shown comprehensively that overtreatment and denial of care, health care fraud, catastrophic costs and spiralling health expenditure are features of the US health care system.  Health expenditure in the US is out of control for both public and out-of-pocket payments.  The countries that have adopted the US model of mixed public and private funding, together with public and private provision, have more marketisation, higher administration and transaction costs, the greatest inequalities in access and health outcomes, a lack of coverage and the highest out-of-pocket payments.  As this committee has repeatedly seen and heard, out-of-pocket payments are major barriers to access in Ireland.  They have a major impact on patients and their access to health care.<br\/><br\/>According to a report on the Irish health system published by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, in 2008 the full out-of-pocket costs for primary health care were being paid by two thirds of the population.  This committee has heard evidence from GPs involved in the deep end initiative about the operation of the inverse care law in Ireland.  There is maldistribution of funds and services because resource allocation does not follow need.  Of course the inverse care law is attributable to a Welsh GP, Dr. Julian Tudor Hart, who wrote in <i>The Lancet<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served.  This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced.<\/blockquote> <p>The second of those sentences is seldom quoted.  To paraphrase, when health care becomes a commodity, it becomes distributed just like champagne: the rich gets lots of it and the poor do not get any.<br\/><br\/>The UK established its National Health Service in 1948.  The legislation had been enacted in 1946.  The NHS is a universal integrated public health system which is free at the point of delivery and funded through central taxation.  It is generally agreed by all organisations, including the World Health Organization and the World Bank, that central taxation is the fairest and most efficient way of funding health care.  There is consensus on this in all the reports.  The NHS - the legislation underpinning it and the system itself - is important because it became the model for the health systems of many countries around the world.  For the first 40 years of its operation, the NHS was the lowest cost, most efficient and fairest system.  In Bevan's words, the NHS guaranteed health care to all citizens without fear of catastrophic health care costs or being denied care.  This freedom from fear was very important.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, following over two decades of market incrementalism, the Government in England abolished the universal public model by removing from the Secretary of State the duty to provide key health services throughout England.  Instead, it made commercial contracting virtually compulsory and introduced new mechanisms for fragmenting and dismantling care and reducing services and entitlements.  The structure of the foundation trusts that had been brought in was changed in 2004 to make them 49% private.  As a result, they can generate up to 49% of their income privately.  This has diverted the attention of the boards of the trusts and, as a result, they now have a greater focus on private income.  At the same time, US-inspired market risk selection mechanisms have been introduced over the past 20 years.  Most recently, there was a switch to membership-based organisations, as opposed to planning services on the basis of need, and to diagnosis related groups, trusts and tax breaks.  This has had catastrophic consequences for universal public health care.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that Scotland and Wales have retained the universal single-tier integrated public NHS model.  As the UK Treasury in Westminster controls funding through the block grant allocation, their systems are coming under severe pressure.  However, they are experiencing nothing like the catastrophic chaos that is ongoing in England, where 75% of foundation trusts are in serious financial deficit.  Barely a week goes by without a chief executive losing his or her job or a failure regime coming into play.  By contrast, no hospital in Scotland is going to the wall because hospitals and community services there are integrated into and directly managed by health boards, which in turn are accountable to and responsible for local health needs.  It might be worthwhile for the committee to look at an interesting experiment in Scotland that involves the integration of health and social care.<br\/><br\/>If universal health care is the goal of this committee, as I understand it is, it needs to understand how the principles of universal health care underpinned by public health need, redistribution, risk pooling and social solidarity are alienated by markets and marketisation.  In addition, clear and strong laws are needed to enact universal health care.  I disagree with the argument that incrementalism might be the best strategy for Ireland because the pace of change would be too slow and might take the health system in the wrong direction.  There has been an erosion of entitlements since 2008.  I refer, for example, to the introduction of means-testing for medical cards in 2009 and to the increases in the levels of payments and charges for some services.  I accept that the eligibility criteria that apply to the GP-visit card were extended in 2015.<br\/><br\/>Of course every country must build on its existing infrastructure and take account of its own history and services.  All countries with a national health service have put in place laws and strong legal frameworks to ensure that universal national health service happens and that parliament commits to it.  It does not remain an aspiration.  If what this committee seeks to do is to be done, a strong political consensus needs to be built to overcome the many vested interests that would retain the fragmented and marketised private elements of the service and jeopardise the health of many people for the benefit of a few others.  My understanding is that given the committee&rsquo;s commitment to articulating a vision for a universal single-tier health service, an NHS Bill for Ireland is the essential first step in a ten-year plan.<br\/><br\/>If a law is enacted which commits the Government to providing universal health care to all citizens and residents throughout the land, the Oireachtas will decide how much it will spend.  It is the task of the administrative bureaucracy to determine how the functions will be implemented, to ensure resources are allocated fairly, appropriately and according to need, and to develop formulae accordingly.<\/p><p>A bottom-up approach to change can be adopted.  Access to universal health care requires strong systems of public administration and adherence to six common principles: fairness of financing; fairness of resource allocation; risk pooling and social solidarity in service provision; political accountability and control; service integration through geographic units of administration; and public accountability through strong systems of information and monitoring and surveillance systems.<\/p><p> The committee has heard from experts representing the Irish Medical Organisation and many other organisations that primary care teams are essential because they are the gatekeepers to acute and specialist care and have a major part to play in prevention, rehabilitation and working with social services.  A strong primary and social care system that is rooted in strong information systems is essential to ensure health care for all.  As the committee has already heard, primary care is seriously underfunded and is under-capacity.  This creates pressure on acute services, social services and the family.  In my opinion, a Bill to put in place the necessary legal framework for a national health service throughout Ireland is essential.  It would be the first necessary step in achieving the sustainable development goals for universal health care and access to rational, essential and affordable medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Pollock for her presentation.

I suppose the challenge for us is to work out how we get from where we are now - with a disjointed two-tier hospital-centric system - to a point where we can recommend a particular course of action.  Given that the Irish health system is so hospital-centric, does Professor Pollock believe we should seek to change the model of care to move activity from the hospital to the community before we legislate for a basket of services to which people would have a legal entitlement, or does she think both sides of the equation can be done simultaneously?

The UK was no exception.  It was highly fragmented.  There was a patchwork of services with significant inequalities.  For that reason, a law is needed that places on the Minister a duty to provide services throughout Ireland.  That is the only way to overcome the fragmentation, imbalance and inequity in resources.  Of course there is a move to try to improve resources all the time, but that cannot be done without an Act of Parliament.  This course of action would not preclude the committee from beginning to work to improve primary care services, to increase the level of funding and to take initiatives forward.  I would argue that this needs to be part of the plan.  There is nothing preventing Governments from putting more money into primary care by increasing funding from the current level of 3%, which is abysmally low, and by increasing cover.  If the big picture and the big vision for this committee is universal health care, it must stick to that.  There are risks associated with zooming in and out.  If one zooms in too close, into the very micro-details of the health system, one has to cover everything from how primary care and acute health services are run in small areas to the allocation of resources.  I feel that the committee's job should be to focus on the big picture - the big vision of how Ireland can get to universal access and how it can provide for the duty I have mentioned.  There is nothing to preclude anyone from building up primary care as legislation is going through, or from putting the planning in place.  I know it can take a couple of years or more for legislation to go through.  I would not say it is a case of one or the other - I would do both at the same time.<\/p> <p>  The Chair also asked an interesting question about human rights.  She seemed to be wondering whether individuals can argue that they have a legal entitlement to health care.  I would caution against such an approach.  Brazil, for example, provides for a right to health and to health care in its constitution, but it has not managed to address the huge inequities in its health system.  The courts there have been used by individuals who can afford access to justice to exercise their right to health care, but that is not solidaristic.  If those courts make very peculiar decisions under the Brazilian constitution, that creates even more chaos and inequality.  I think I need to understand more from the committee about what it has in mind when it talks about a legal entitlement to primary health care and community care at the local level.  My view would be that if the duty flows from the Minister - in the UK, the Secretary of State for Health - all the structures and resources would follow those duties, powers and functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I would like to get some clarification in that regard.

It looks at the Secretary of State's duty to provide certain services, including mental health services and local pharmaceutical services.  The full range of services has been listed in the relevant legislation since 1946.

One of the important things to note is that England introduced an internal market purchaser-provider split in 1990.  That model was followed by Wales and Scotland.  However, when devolution came in 2000, Scotland and Wales took the step of deciding to abolish their internal markets.  That was pretty much a silent revolution.  People do not realise it even happened.  It took place through legislation.  They abolished the purchaser-provider split and reintegrated hospitals and services into health boards, making them responsible for the needs of the population.  This required legislation.  It was a legislative process.  They have now gone further in that they are now moving to integrate social services into health services using a bottom-up approach, which is an interesting approach.  That is the difference between Scotland and England and what has been happening in the past 13 years.  Scotland has gone further.  There was a political declaration by the Scottish National Party not to have private provision.<\/p> <p>  The second question was about information systems.  These are the lifeblood of any health system.  Scotland operates an information system, ISD Scotland.  It is part of a special health board or authority.  That is how information is managed.  It is superb.  It is the jewel in the crown of the Scottish health service.  It means we can undertake many comprehensive studies.  It very much mirrors the systems in place in Scandinavia.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will be well aware of the debacle over information in England, not only fragmentation but the care data scenario as well.  The intention of the Bill we are writing is to put information back under the direct control of the Secretary of State and a health authority.  At the moment, information in England is deeply problematic, especially care data, what has happened with general practitioner practices and the ability to get data.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a good question about accountability on the part of the Minister.  Again, my view is that if Ireland were developing legislation, those responsible should strengthen systems of accountability.  I am referring not only to the Parliament but to accountability to the people as well.  This is an area where we have seen a major weakening in England.  We used to have community health councils, which had a direct right of appeal to the Secretary of State.  We had a number of good mechanisms at local, district and regional level whereby the Secretary of State and the Parliament could be brought to account by local people.  I think the question about accountability is singularly important.  This point should be worked out in legislation.  I hope that answers the questions of the first speaker.<\/p> <p>  The question of the second speaker related to the role of the private health care system.  I would put it the other way around.  I will put the following questions to committee members.  What evidence is there that incorporating private health insurance and private providers actually ameliorates the inequity we see in the system?  What evidence is there that they can deliver universal health care and social solidarity?  What evidence is there that they can keep the costs of health care and transaction costs low and ensure there is no subsidy from the public to private sectors?  That is what I would be going on.  What is the evidence for private health insurance and private provision in ameliorating and preventing inequalities in health care and in ensuring universal access?  There is considerable evidence to the contrary.  All the evidence points the other way and suggests it does not.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the 44% of people covered by private health insurance.  Work needs to be done to understand the extent to which people use that insurance and the extent to which tax subsidies exist.  We know there are such subsidies for people who use private health insurance.  We know there are tax breaks to private health providers.<\/p> <p>  It is about building political consensus such that people can believe the system will be there when they need it and such that they do not need private health insurance.  I think if there was major legislation setting out the intention, people would find that private health insurance would wither on the vine.  It should wither away.  Indeed, in the United Kingdom in spite of all the chaos in England, coverage by private health insurance is less than 10%.  The figure has been falling since 2008.  That is partly as a result of the financial crisis, but the level is far lower than the level in the Irish health system.  Some countries prohibit private health insurance, such as Canada.  The set-up in Canada prohibits a two-tier system from existing.  Under the Canada Health Act health care is provided in the public system and people cannot use private health insurance as an alternative route.<\/p><p>These are things that need to be debated and discussed.  The central issue is whether private health care, private health insurers or private providers reduce inequalities, increase access, decrease costs and ensure social solidarity.  I am happy to come back in on that.<\/p><p> Deputy Madigan asked me about health promotion initiatives.  As a result of marketisation, most public health functions in England have been transferred under Public Health England to local authorities.  This has been catastrophic because local authorities have faced major cuts in social services expenditure and are facing cuts of &pound;200 million in public health expenditure.  Many vital health promotion and prevention programmes that were in place in areas like school nursing, health visiting, district nursing, smoking prevention and cessation and alcohol intervention are being seriously cut at the moment.  Indeed, some of these services will no longer exist in local authorities.  At the same time, because there is no longer a duty of provision on the Secretary of State, the individual clinical commissioning groups that have replaced the old primary care trusts and area-based health authorities are now decommissioning whole ranges of services.  The criteria for hip arthroplasty and cataract procedures, for example, have been changed.  Many preventative services, including some forms of surgery, can be seen as preventative.  Hip arthroplasty, which is the most common elective surgery operation, can be preventative if it is done on time because it prevents people from falling and becoming disabled and enables people to continue to live at home.  A range of services are being decommissioned, slashed or no longer funded in local authorities.  I do not have a good news story for the committee from England.  All of this flows from the abolition in 2012 of the Secretary of State's duty to provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I will bring in the next group of three speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#E00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Pollock for her stimulating presentation.

If we were to pursue a certain strategy and take a certain legislative route to provide for universal health care, would she recommend that we should work towards the Canadian model of ensuring no private health insurance is available?  I have to say it is a very interesting theory.  Speaking of theories, we are all familiar with the work of the NHS since its inception in the 1946 to 1948 period.  There was a change in policy in the early 1990s with Thatcherism, etc.  Has a lack of consistency in political thought under various Governments in the UK had a negative effect on how the NHS has been working in recent years?  I refer also to the changes in the internal market, etc.  Professor Pollock spoke in detail about primary health care and particularly the model that is adopted in Scotland, as opposed to Wales and England.  Can she get into the details of the differences between what is done in Scotland and the rest of the UK?  What does the NHS do so successfully to maintain staff in its system?

I thank Professor Pollock for her presentation.  I would like to ask three questions.  It has been suggested that there should be a shift in the Irish health service towards the establishment and strengthening of a model of hospital trusts.  These trusts would have the power to raise their own finances independently and to outsource services from the private sector.  I understand this has been a feature of the health system in the UK in recent years.  I wonder if Professor Pollock can tell us whether it has been a good or bad experience.  What has actually happened?  Professor Pollock has argued that systems which are based on private health care are more expensive.  Can she explain why she thinks that is the case?  Is it fundamentally a case of profiteering or of wastage that might be associated with duplication or markets?  Could Professor Pollock break down some of the information on that issue?  In her book <i>NHS plc: The Privatisation of Our Health Care<\/i>, Professor Pollock argues that universal health care systems are superior to systems that target services and health care provision.  Can she explain why she thinks that even though targeting of services and provision sounds fair, it often does not seem to work out that way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#E00900","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I invite Professor Pollock to respond to the questions that have been asked by the three Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#E01000","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I was asked whether private health insurance should be outlawed for treatments that are being provided by the public sector, as in the Canadian health care system.  There is a strong argument to be made for that on the basis of the evidence on private health insurance.  I return to my original point about whether there is any evidence that private health insurance reduces or ameliorates inequalities.  There is really no such evidence.<\/p><p>The Canadian health model is a very interesting one to look at, although it is under challenge at the moment.  There is a constitutional court challenge being made in British Columbia on the very issue of private provision, private payments and private health insurance.  Canada is under attack at the moment from a particular doctor, Dr. Brian Day, who has a very large private practice in British Columbia.  All the available evidence shows that private health insurance does not reduce equalities or ameliorate health care, does not give the subsidy people argue it gives and results in greater inefficiency.  Importantly, it also diverts staff and services.  In Ireland, for example, I understand that 20% of beds in public hospitals can be used for private patients with private health insurance.  That is a diversion of public capacity and it will get worse if hospitals are given more powers to generate private income.  It means that staff and services that should be available for the public health and universal health system are being diverted and leads to distortions in the system. <\/p><p> The second question was on lack of consistency in government policy in England.  The government has been entirely consistent in its policy direction.  We had the Thatcher reforms on the Internal Market, which was followed by the period when John Major was Prime Minister.  Apart from one small period when Frank Dobson was the Secretary of State for Health, the new Labour government was very consistent in pushing through greater marketisation.  It introduced foundation trusts, for example, and continued with the private finance initiative, albeit against a backdrop of the largest ever increase in public expenditure.  It was this increase that made these changes possible without hurting the system greatly.  If one is marketising and privatising, one needs to push in a great deal of money, which is what has happened.  We have, therefore, had an entirely consistent ideologically driven rather than evidence-based programme from the late 1980s onwards, culminating in 2012.  The dismantling Acts of Parliament, which would not have been possible without all the implementing legislation that went before it.<\/p><p> That takes me into general practice.  One of the key Acts of Parliament in 2003-04 was not just the law on foundation trusts but the changes to the way primary care was organised and delivered.  Previously, contracts for general practitioners were between the secretary of state and the individual GP.  What the 2003-04 Act of Parliament brought in was legislation introducing new contractual forms.  After this, in addition to the traditional general medical services, GMS, contract, we also had the alternative providers of medical services, APMS, contract and variants thereof known as personal medical services, PMS, contracts, which could be negotiated with GPs.  The APMS contract resulted in companies coming in, running and owning GP practices and employing general practitioners.  This has created major problems and schisms in England.  General practitioners on conventional GMS contracts are being underfunded and are handing back to the keys to their practices, with the result that some areas of England will no longer have general practices.  At the same time, large companies such as Virgin, Care UK and UnitedHealthcare, a big American corporation, came in to run and operate GP practices and to salary the GPs.  Some of these practices are not doing very well and the companies in turn are simply walking away from the contracts.  As there is no duty on the Secretary of State to provide any more services, there is a very real risk that whole areas of England will be without a service.<\/p><p> One must be very careful if one wants to corporatise and bring in commercial companies to run and operate GP practices.  The legislation was accompanied by more recent legislation which will allow GP practices to take patients from anywhere in the country.  Practice boundaries were dissolved as of January 2016 and a variety of complex changes have been introduced that have changed health care from being area based to being membership based.  I can explain more about that.<\/p><p> In contrast, while Scotland also has a crisis in the recruitment and retention of staff, it is nothing like the crisis affecting England.  This is partly because Scotland has refused to introduce the APMS contract form, which means there are no commercial companies providing and delivering care.  This is the result of a battle and legislation introduced in 2010 or 2011. <\/p><p> One comes to the very interesting question of how Ireland will retain staff in its national health service.  My understanding is that it appears from OECD figures - these may be skewed and I am not sure how true this statement is - that general practitioners and hospital consultants are among the best paid in Europe when compared with their counterparts.  I do not know how true that is as there was a problem in that the OECD could not include private practice in its figures.<\/p><p> Retaining staff requires a number of initiatives to be taken.  There is the idea of being salaried.  Terms and conditions and pay are what the trade unions and Irish Medical Organisation negotiate.  However, there are other initiatives to do with professionalisation of the workforce.  Our royal colleges have played a major role in this regard.  There are lots of other cherries that go with one's status, however.  It is not necessarily only related to pay, but also to doing a good job, being appreciated and being able to take and drive forward new initiatives.  In my experience, these factors are a much greater motivator for most doctors and clinical staff than money.  Salaries are important but much more important for staff is the day to day job they are doing and having the resources and capacity to innovate and drive change.  One of the greatest triumphs of the national health service for many years was its ability to drive innovation and, through clinical innovation, to drive change.<\/p><p> The committee heard a great deal about the motivation of doctors in the two most recent sessions of evidence.  The retention and recruitment of staff is important.  We need to put plans in place but this is difficult when junior doctors are leaving medical school with debts of &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000.  They may not share the public service ethos or commitment that I and all my colleagues had.  I did not pay any charges or fees when I did my degree.  These issues need to be thought about and one needs to have an education system that encourages people to have a public service ethos and an obligation to give back and pay back for the rest of their lives.  This is something we lose sight of in the national health service where there is an extraordinary feeling of obligation and giving back among staff every day.  This will be lost now that students pay catastrophically large fees.  The health system in Ireland must also think about the higher education system and training. <\/p><p> Deputy Joan Collins commented on her interest in universal health care and the problems with the US health care system and referred to the need to look at the systems in place in Canada, Scotland and Scandinavia.  I would advocate looking at the Scottish model.  While no model is perfect, the Scottish model always aspires to be perfect and it is a good model to look at.  The Canadian health system, which is under threat from the constitutional challenge to which I referred, is another model to look at and think about.  It is a more federal system.  The Institute of Medicine report from 2012, for which I can send the committee a link, sets out very well that the US health care system is not only the most expensive and unfair system in the western world but also one that has enormous transaction costs.<\/p><p>Up to $3 trillion has been spent in 2012.  Almost $1 trillion was actually spent, or was wasted, due to administration costs, fraud, unnecessary tests and unnecessary investigations, including surgery.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the question of trusts and the move in Ireland to establish hospital trusts to raise their own finances and add some services.  We have been there before.  In 1990 we inaugurated the internal market and allowed hospitals to become corporate bodies and use private finance initiatives, PFI, and outsourcing.  The whole idea of raising one's own money is to look to the markets and private finance and of course the private finance initiative is a totally discredited policy on all sides of government.  We are left with these major debts and not just in health but also in education, the courts, prisons, roads and so on.  We have this extraordinary debt that we are now servicing for the next 30 to 60 years and very little control.  So, if one wants to look at the catastrophe of allowing trusts to raise their own finances look at where our foundation trusts are today.  Most of them have PFIs. They have been allowed to raise their own finances, they are carrying these debts which must be serviced off their annual income and 75% of foundation trusts are now in deficit with serious financial difficulties. <\/p><p> Allowing trusts to rely on PFI in that source has been problematic.  The private finance initiatives, or public private partnerships, PPP, also include a mechanism for outsourcing ancillary staff and services.  That was a disaster and many, if not most, PFIs have actually brought their services back in-house when the contract has allowed that to happen.  They found that when outsourcing quality and standards fell, the costs were high and they were getting very poor value.  That was instrumental in returning services back in-house into the hospitals.  Foundation trusts who outsourced and raised finances are left with a very big problem in that as much as 15% or 16% of their income will now be going to service the debts of PFI.  Everybody knows it is much cheaper for the Government to raise the money either through Government borrowing or through taxation.  Look at the histories and experiences of PFI, including the recent report by the UK's Treasury Select Committee.  It is a totally discredited policy.<\/p><p> The other big problem with allowing hospitals to raise more of their money privately is that they become much more keen on looking at income and they are no longer integrated into the health service.  They are no longer putting the National Health Service services as a top priority.  The income generation becomes really important.  If the committee is really interested in the effect of allowing hospitals to do their own thing and to raise their own income only, look at the Mid-Staffordshire NHS foundation trust report, the result of an inquiry which lasted over 18 months.  It is an enormous report which shows that at the heart of the problem was that the trust board were focused on income and income targets, including private income, to the detriment of patients and patient care.  It is another argument for taking hospitals out of trust status and reintegrating them into the health service.  The other argument is that while our hospitals are pursuing their own agendas, they are not now necessarily focused on the primary care, the rehabilitation and the prevention which is what we are interested in.  They move further and further away into the risk selection and risk avoidance mechanisms when they are focused only on the bottom line.<\/p><p> Reference was made to universal health care programmes as opposed to targeting health programmes.  It is a reality that in many universal health care systems one will also have targeted health programmes.  One will have programmes such as breast screening, cervical cancer screening or immunisation.  There will be programmes to target specific needs while under the umbrella of universal health care system.  Problems arise when one does not have a universal health care system.  This can be seen at its extremes in low income countries such as in Africa and India where one has practical health programmes with separate funding that are brought in but there is no universal health care system.  They would have a focus, for example, on HIV and AIDS, on TB, malaria or diabetes, but they are not thinking comprehensively or holistically about the patient.  Targeted health programmes have their place within the universal health care system.  However, targeted  health programmes have no place if one has no universal health care system.  We should not be dealing with two.<\/p><p> The committee has not asked about the National Treatment Purchase Fund and our experience of using the equivalent of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which was the fund for the independent sector treatment centres, ISTC.  This was where doctors and patients could refer to the private sector under the rubric of choice.  Some &pound;4 million was top-sliced by the Government for the ISTC programme, which included NHS and private providers.  However, the health select committee reports, of which there have been several, show that the ISTC programme did not provide value for money, it increased the costs, was inefficient and there was no evidence of innovation. That ISTC programme has been significantly rolled back.<\/p><p> I will stop there and I hope I have answered the committee's questions.  If not then please come back to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Pollock for her comprehensive responses.

The first issue is the huge transaction costs.  Administration, billing, invoicing and the administrative costs of the market are, we know from the US studies, anything from 30% to 50% of the US dollar.  That is very high indeed.  In the UK, in the publicly administered services the transaction costs because of administration were only 6%.  They were 5% if one looks at the first 40 years of the total budget, which is very low indeed.  When we move to the internal market, with trusts and internal billing and invoicing, we move to 12%.  It is very likely now, because we have compulsory contracting, that we are moving to the 20% or 30%.  It is very likely because we now have teams of lawyers, accountants, management consultants on both sides - the trusts and the companies.  Every time one has gone out to tender, there are six or seven bidders and all the process which that involves.  That is the first big reason.  It is the type of market which is very much more expensive than a public administration.<\/p> <p>  The second reason of course is the profit motive, which is hidden in all sorts of ways.  One has profits but one also has to do marketing.  If it is a commercial company it has to sell its goods so it will spend a lot on marketing and public relations.  There are other costs.  Given that there is risk selection and risk avoidance, one has to put in very expensive systems in order to select carefully the patients who will be treated, the more profitable patients and the healthier patients.  Protocols would have to be developed and there would have to be risk management systems so that the costs are off-loaded when those patients get too expensive.<\/p><p>That in turn generates a new system of costs for the rump public sector that is left behind, which is inevitably the service that picks things up.  In the UK, when things go wrong in our private treatment centres for elective surgery, and one needs to go back into intensive care, the first place one goes is back to the NHS.  One always goes back there.  Whether it is for outpatient or intensive care treatment, it is the NHS that picks up the pieces.  Of course, the other thing is because the private sector is into risk avoidance, we will not get the same levels of primary prevention.<\/p><p> I noticed that in some of the evidence given to the health select committee Kaiser Permanente was cited.  I will happily send the committee a paper we published more than ten years ago looking at the claims of Kaiser Permanente around its prevention and rehabilitation.  Kaiser Permanente is a health maintenance organisation, HMO, in the US.  It is highly selective in the patients it recruits to the insurance system and the patients it treats.  It does not have a universal service obligation which means it selects out the more profitable patients, that is, those who can pay their health insurance, and the more profitable services.  There is a huge mythology around Kaiser Permanente and I am happy to send the committee our published paper, which refutes and rebuts it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Pollock and call Deputy Michael Harty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#H00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and Professor Pollock for engaging with our committee.

Around that time, if my memory serves me correctly, there was a sort of realignment of the NHS, because the costs were getting out of control when it came to pensions, and there was a huge renegotiation of contracts.  I was a junior at the time and I was not really thinking about a pension at that stage.  My question is this.  Has Professor Pollock any suggestions as to how we can anticipate such overruns and how we might manage those if we are looking at a universal health care model in this country?<\/p> <p>  I may not be right but my experience in the NHS was that there was a very good basic level of care, which was quite universal, and an extensive menu of services but that higher levels of treatment were not necessarily, in my experience, as good as perhaps we have here.  There were huge restrictions.  One thing that struck me when I returned to Ireland was that in Ireland, one got whatever treatment one required.  Depending on the type of cancer one had, there seemed to be fewer restrictions.  In the UK, there was huge input by the pharmacoeconomics departments into working out the cost-benefit of drugs.  On the ground what that meant was that people did not get the same level of treatment that people in Ireland were getting for some complex illnesses.  What is Professor Pollock's experience in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that GPs in the NHS must reach specific targets when it comes to certain conditions.  For example, they must do X amount of smears in a month and X amount of interventions with people with diabetes.  I happen to have a family member who is a GP in London.  From chatting about it, sometimes, in order to reach those targets for those specific and very important health measures, day-to-day bread and butter stuff like children with tonsillitis and other bits and bobs tend to get pushed to the side because GPs are so focused on meeting their targets for certain things within the basket of treatments that their surgery is to deliver.  What are Professor Pollock's views on that and how it has trickled down and affected people's lives?<\/p> <p>  The prescription service in the NHS - I think the forms were called FP10s but the name may have changed - was free at the point of delivery.  There were no prescription charges for pregnant women, army veterans or students as well as those who satisfied a means test.  My experience as a pharmacist in Ireland is that sometimes we need a small barrier - not a massive one - at the point of delivery, so that people appreciate things and there is less waste.  Does Professor Pollock agree?<\/p> <p>  I think that is it.  Will Professor Pollock address the pitfalls in the GP contract, the levels of care comparatively between the two countries, that there are no barriers to access and the pressures unrestricted access to certain services put on a system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#H00900","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Connell.

The question really is whether we should have a single piece of legislation to create a national health service for Ireland.  I said my opinion is \"yes\".  If one looks at all the countries that have introduced a national health service, theirs were usually fragmented, inequitable and a patchwork of services.  However, that is not a reason not to introduce a single national health service.  One builds on what one has got.  Legislation will take a year or two years to enact and a further year to implement.  During that time, the Civil Service and politicians need to be working in great detail to plan that service so that, as Deputy Harty said, it can open on a particular day.  I think 6 July 1948 was the inaugural day for our national health service.<\/p> <p>  I would advocate having a single piece of legislation that makes the duty on the Minister very clear.  Some of the best brains in the country are in the Civil Service and around this table and they could be working and planning for it.  Of course, it does not just happen by enacting an Act of Parliament.  It needs all the work that underpins it to thrash it out.  I would go further in advocating that one would want to understand all the legislation that came before and bring it all together in one comprehensive piece of legislation.  I worked with a brilliant barrister on our NHS Bill over a period of five or six years.  I would say, \"Go for it\".  Go for a really clean universal health care and a single tier health care system, I say, \"Do it.\"  One will never get there on the back of incrementalism.  The lobbyists and vested interest groups are too strong and powerful and will always hold one back. <\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Connell for the second set of questions.  They were dating from 2003 and 2004, which was really a time of increasing marketisation.<\/p><p>This was the time of the new general medical services contract, which brought in the alternative providers of medical services.<\/p><p> I was asked a good question about pensions.  Pensions in the NHS have always been pay-as-you-go.  Actually, they have returned more to the UK Treasury than they have taken out.  Last year, I gather &pound;2 billion was returned to the Treasury, but I will need to double-check that.  Anyway, more money was returned than taken out.  Since then the UK Government has acted in a number of ways to put a brake on the total pension sum that a person can hold and to change benefit and pension entitlements.  There are always things that governments can do if they believe pensions are out of control.  However, pensions have never been out of control in the NHS.  It is a pay-as-you-go model and it has been a good system, unlike other pensions.<\/p><p> The second question was whether Ireland was providing better specialist or tertiary services.  If that was put to the people in our teaching hospitals, I wonder how they would respond.  I have in mind Guy's Hospital and St. Thomas' Hospital, as well as St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where I work now.  I think people can only make those sorts of claims in two ways.  The first is using the research and evidence available.  I would look at treatment rates for common things, including hip, plastics, cataract and cardiac treatment.  I have a feeling that the United Kingdom is doing equally as well as Ireland.  I am not meant to say we are doing better or worse unless I have the comparative data to say as much.  In Scotland we recently finished a study looking at elective hip and cataract replacement.  Can the health services here provide me with similar data to undertake a similar study in order that we could show that we are providing the same sort of access on the basis of need?  That is why information is really important.  We need to collect the data to look at that.  Patients' perspectives are important as well.  The Commonwealth Fund continues to rate UK health services highly, indeed, above Ireland, if we are to believe the ranking scores and surveys.<\/p><p> The third question related to phamacoeconomics.  We have two issues.  We have the dilemma of prioritisation and how we prioritise resources and services, as well as the issue of effectiveness, in other words, the evidence of effectiveness and benefit.  The UK Government set up the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 1999 or 2000 especially to examine evidence of effectiveness of drugs.  The institute includes the quality and cost dimensions in its considerations.  There is an issue here for Ireland because when I have looked at the health systems and transition reports, it appears that Ireland, even though it could be a monopsony purchaser on the part of Government, has very high drug costs.  Of course those costs get passed on to patients.  If those involved were to do more negotiation with the drug companies, they might be able to get drug costs down and that would have a significant impact on the budget in Ireland.<\/p><p> The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is important because it brings some evidence of efficacy and effectiveness, as well as the cost-benefit analysis.  It has been an important body in terms of negotiation on the entry of drugs into the public system, as well as helping as part of the negotiation around cost.  It is a model we should look at to see whether it is something that would suit Ireland.  One of the major problems we have with drugs in all countries arises when we give a drug marketing approval.  Our regulators give approval for the market and then, it is a free-for-all.  One of the issues for a public system is the nature of the evidence of the benefit and on what basis should we give access to the public system.  That is always a dilemma, whether for vaccines or drugs.  That is why we need a scientific approach.  We also need to negotiate hard with the manufacturers, because the prices of drugs and technologies are one of the greatest inflationary costs, much more so than staff costs.  They are an enormous inflationary driver.  We have to control those costs and ensure far more rational medicine and diagnostic use.<\/p><p> I was asked a good question about targets for general practitioners, GPs, and whether the targets were actually preventing them from being more holistic in their approach.  Indeed most GPs would argue in favour of this view.  The NHS quality and outcomes framework, QOF, has been greatly disliked by GPs because it links payment to targets.  They believe this undermines their more holistic role.  The system was brought in as part of the new corporate framework, the alternative provider medical services and general medical services contract revisions.  Scotland now has abandoned and got rid of its QOF and England is beginning to move away from it more and more.  I hope that answers the question.  Targets were part of a market critique.  The idea was that we had to have market incentives and payments but what resulted was that these market mechanisms created perverse incentives to focus not on the patient but on the numbers.  The focus was on the numbers rather than what the needs of patients were and whether given treatments were the right treatments.<\/p><p> I was asked about FP10 prescription charges.  In England it is indeed the case that the majority of people who receive a prescription are actually exempt because they fall in to the category of pregnant women, children under 18 years of age or older people.  Scotland and Wales have now abolished prescription charges completely.  There has been no obvious evidence of an inflationary effect.  I will offer some anecdotes here.  Some GPs argue that it has actually improved their prescribing.  Before, they were conscious that patients had to pay for the prescriptions and therefore gave the patients double or triple courses and far more drugs than they needed for longer periods.  Now, they can give short courses, see the patient again and, as a result, there is less waste in the system.  The evidence of prescription charges is that they curtail access.  They are a major barrier to access.  There is no evidence that having a prescription charge is a good thing or that it results in rational medicine prescribing or use.  Again, Scotland and Wales would be good to look for.  There is still a movement in England to abolish prescription charges.  There is also evidence that the cost of collecting those charges is problematic.  The cost of the administration is greater than the prescription charges income.  There is good evidence on that as well.  I can send the material to the committee.  I hope I have dealt with those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Professor Pollock.  I have one further question.  You referred earlier to the geographic organisation of health services.  In Ireland, the HSE is a national organisation, but it has recently reorganised the hospital sector into six hospital groups - these were referred to earlier - with some intention to move towards hospital trusts.  At the same time, the primary and community care services are organised in nine different community health organisations.  I would welcome your opinion on whether that is a viable way of organising services when there is no alignment between hospitals and primary and community services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#J00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>This is horizontal integration.  The market moves towards vertical and horizontal integration.  This is rather reminiscent of what happens in the United States, where there are hospital groups and primary and community care service groups.  I think it is deeply problematic because the idea of the Secretary of State having a duty to provide is that this duty is then devolved or delegated down to contiguous areas that cover all the population in a country.  We really want those areas to be responsible for providing and delivering the services their residents need, including primary care, community care, mental health, acute services, rehabilitation and prevention.<\/p><p>That cannot be achieved if silos are created like hospital groups which become increasingly powerful, or primary care community groups.  The funding, 3% of the budget for primary care, is so small that they will never be able to withstand the hospital groups and it is much more likely that they will be incorporated into the hospital groups in a sort of accountable peer organisational model.  That is the real risk because these accountable care organisations, ACOs, like the American health maintenance organisations, HMOs, which were the forerunner of ACOs, are coming into play.  What is needed are area-based populations with responsibility in those areas for providing and ensuring universal services which are integrated in that area.  That can never be achieved through hospital groups and silos of primary and community care.  If anything there is a risk, under the HSE, of creating the American type of ACO which would have mechanisms for cherry-picking and risk selection.  I think that is a very worrying development, especially if hospitals and these hospital groups will be given more powers to raise their own income through private finance and private income generation.  That is a very worrying and disturbing development.<\/p><p> That development has been paralleled in England which has now abolished its area-based structures.  We had area-based health authorities, which became primary care trusts but they were always area-based, and in place of them are clinical commissioning groups, CCGs, but they are membership-based and look after only the residents who are members of their CCGs.  One becomes a member by joining a general practice.  The legislation is in place for us to move much more to the sort of grouping the committee describes.  We are seeing this happen with our hospitals and our primary and community care organisations with federated structures in order that hospitals and primary care and community trusts are merging across large areas.  We are seeing that under the guise of the national system but it is a move towards a US HMO accountable care organisation with all the dangers and warnings that brings from the Institute of Medicine.  If this is happening in Ireland, it makes the case for legislation to bring in a national health service even stronger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Allyson Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>That completes the questions from the committee.

We recognise the absolute importance of collectively delivering good chronic disease management in our surgeries and in the communities of this country.  There is pressing work to be done on the issue.  We are making a joint presentation by way of opening comments.<\/p> <p>  At the Irish College of General Practitioners, we support the development of a five to ten-year plan to address the challenges facing our health care service.  We are here today to outline cost-effective solutions aligning care nearer to patients in the community and delivering safer, better and more efficient chronic disease care.  The more the patient is taken out of the community, the worse the care is and the more expensive it becomes.  Patients want to be cared for in their communities.  Some of our solutions, as addressed in our main submission, can be implemented today.  There are things we can do immediately through effective legislation and it must be remembered that the committee's members are legislators.<\/p><p>Other recommendations may take longer to implement, but we congratulate the Oireachtas on providing for a ten-year timeframe and depoliticising the issue.  We wish members the very best in their work in this committee.  There is an urgent and critical need to agree to a new contract for general practice to effectively support the care of the complex patient in the community.  GPs and general practice are central to this process.<\/p><p> I am director of the postgraduate resource centre in the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, as well as a family doctor in Newbridge, County Kildare.  My locum had to leave and I spent the whole summer trying to find cover for my partner who is on maternity leave.  This morning my patients are being looked after by Dr. Eamonn Dillon and Dr. Noel Caffery.  It was a horrible summer.  Dr. Brian Osborne is assistant director of the postgraduate resource centre and a GP in County Galway.  Dr. Laura Noonan is the director for new and establishing GPs at the Irish College of General Practitioners and responsible for GPs who have graduated in the past five years.  She set up her own practice seven weeks ago.  Dr Mark Murphy, ICGP chair of communications, is a GP in County Dublin.<\/p><p> In the ICGP's opening statement we will briefly provide context by outlining a typical day in the life of a GP.  We will discuss the challenges facing patients with complex comorbidities, a particularly vulnerable group.  We will highlight current concerns, but we have brought solutions, if members will listen and legislate.  If they do not legislate, they will fail us all.  We will discuss the core challenges facing patients with chronic diseases in our struggling and very difficult secondary care system and outline solutions. <\/p><p> There is a need for a new contract for general practice as a matter of urgency and we should relax a little about it.  In all the agencies which negotiate contracts for general practice there is a feeling that it is such a difficult and awful job that once we have done it, we will have to leave it there for 20 or 30 years.  That process has failed patients; therefore, we call for a new contract as a matter of urgency and for it to be subject to continuous review every 18 or 24 months, no matter how difficult it is to do.  If we do not get together to discuss the difficulties, poor patients will suffer disease and die younger.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will contextualise the role of the general practitioner in modern Ireland.  A typical GP on the islands and in the towns and cities of Ireland consults directly with approximately 40 patients daily and makes clinical decisions on a further 20 to 40 patients through telephone consulting, repeat prescriptions and actions arising from medical correspondence.  We have a very busy day and manage a wide range of acute and chronic conditions.  GPs provide comprehensive care and manage every single complaint that comes through the door.  We provide for continuity of care and get to know families and patients over time, which is probably why general practice is so effective.  We co-ordinate the care needs of patients through a very fragmented and complicated system and are the first point of contact.  In addition, we gate-keep entry to secondary care.<\/p> <p>  Over nine out of ten of the presentations included in the submission to members are effectively managed by us without onward referral in the health care system, which makes it very effective.  Strong evidence supports investment in general practice and primary care services.  Adding one GP per 10,000 population reduces mortality, which is not necessarily true in the case of a secondary care consultant.  It will reduce the number of emergency department visits, inpatient admissions and outpatient visits and improve the level of health care inequalities.<\/p> <p>  The GP has hit a roadblock and in the last decade, particularly since 2007, the impact of FEMPI legislation cuts on the PCRS-eligible population, together with concurrent reductions in private income, have seen a fundamental destabilisation of general practice in Ireland.  Regrettably, there was a tipping point during the winter of 2015-16.  The prioritisation of acute, urgent presentations in general practice above chronic diseases has resulted in a dangerously stressed workforce in general practice which will be unable to consistently deliver excellence in care unless resourcing shortfalls are addressed urgently.<\/p> <p>  I will outline seven solutions to fix general practice and enable us to manage chronic diseases.  Chronic disease management refers to cardio-metabolic conditions,  arrhythmias, heart failure, respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pain conditions such as osteoarthritis, as well as mental health conditions, which are managed by us.  The current model of chronic disease management, CDM, in Irish health system is expensive, inefficient and lacks patient-centredness.  It has historically been based on an underfunded single-disease model, with poorly defined management between primary and secondary care services.  Effective chronic illness management in general practice reduces overall health care costs, improves outcomes for patients and reduces secondary care utilisation.  As we get to do what we are trained to do, it improves our working environment and delivers more care services in the community.  For example, the Heartwatch programme, led by GPs and practice nurses, dealt with the secondary prevention of heart disease.  The death rate was 5% in Heartwatch patients, as against 14% for those not in the programme.  It is a cost-effective solution in chronic disease management.  It is unjustifiable and inexplicable that it was not rolled out nationwide.  Patients have died because a cost-effective GP-led chronic disease management programme was not rolled out.<\/p> <p>  We recommend the urgent contractual provision of GP-led chronic disease management in communities, fully encompassing the care needs of the complex individual with comorbidities.  GP-led chronic disease management will enable hospitals to do what they do best.  General practice needs an enhanced role in integrated care programmes, as well as clinical care programmes  <\/p> <p>  Access to diagnostics is also crucial in chronic disease management.  We do not have reasonable or effective access to diagnostics, especially radiological tests, CT scans, MRIs and ultrasounds.  Some GPS have no access to them.  We are also talking about endoscopic and cardiac investigations such as an echocardiograph or a BNP blood test.  The end result is that patients end up on an outpatient waiting list or a trolley in an emergency department.  It is ludicrous.  Providing GPs with access to diagnostics enables patient management in the community.  Diagnostic facilities should be considered to be separate from hospitals.  We recommend a uniform national standard waiting time for key investigations based on reasonable international standards.<\/p> <p>  Consultation rates are rising with chronic diseases and an ageing population.  The under-sixes and other cohorts have free access to GP care; therefore, we need to increase capacity in general practice and primary care services.  We need more GPs and a new contract.  We need to train more GPs, but we are still awaiting the service level agreement to be signed with the HSE.  Once that is done, we can train more GPs, but it does not make sense to train more only for them to emigrate.  All my friends are in Australia and Canada.  We have to focus on recruitment and retention strategies, chief among them being a new contract to improve our working conditions.  We need to focus on certain groups, particularly rural practices and practices in the deprived inner city.  We also need to increase the numbers of GPs and of practice nurses to deal with chronic disease.<\/p> <p>  We do not use IT efficiently.  We utilise electronic health records which hospitals have, but the two systems do not communicate.  Therefore, we need to expedite introduction of the individualised patient identifier.  Having a central summary record is one suggestion.  We can now e-refer patients to consultants.  That has helped, although there has been a slow uptake in the past six months for a few reasons.  We sometimes want to make an informal, unstructured query to a consultant through health mail, but that system has not yet taken off.  We need to utilise routinely collected data as we do not know what is happening.  Members of the Oireachtas want to know what is happening, too, and data help to bring accountability, quality and safety.  Therefore, we need to resource these structures.<\/p> <p>  On the question of capacity in primary care services, we need to expand the number of primary care professionals, including psychologists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  We need to resource public health nurses, carers and assistants because that leads to keeping elderly citizens at home for longer.<\/p> <p>  On community supports, GPs have first-hand knowledge that senior citizens would prefer additional supports in the community setting to enable them to remain at home or in adapted accommodation for longer.<\/p><p>Home care packages are essential to the provision of adequate services to elderly patients, providing autonomy, dignity and the ability to live where they want.  Primary care teams are a priority for certain patient groups, and it is essential that primary care team meetings take place.  We are well disposed to primary care teams.  However, only a minority of GPs report positively on their experience.  We can elucidate on that later.<\/p><p> On universal primary care, there is no doubt that we are an outlier.  Most countries have removed cost barriers to general practice and primary care services, either through free access or subsidised payments.  We support increasing access to general practice and primary care, but that is contingent on manpower, IT and built infrastructure capacity.  That can only transpire if an adequate number of GPs are trained and retained in the system through a new GP contract, and expanding access through means testing is the fairest mechanism.<\/p><p> We can also prevent chronic diseases as GPs.  A Government-wide approach on Healthy Ireland is needed to tackle obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, problem alcohol use and stress.  GPs, practice nurses and primary care professionals can make brief interventions to tackle effectively those lifestyle issues.  That can reduce mortality, morbidity and costs, but we need to have the time and capacity to do that.<\/p><p> Finally, on general practice, we spend about 3% of our public health budget in general practice.  The members heard from Professor Allyson Pollock this morning that the United Kingdom spends 11%.  We recommend resourcing Irish general practice in line with other countries.<\/p><p> I will make three brief points about accessing secondary care that are pertinent to chronic disease management.  To give a typical experience as a GP, one patient will wait two years to get her hip replacement.  The next patient will wait two weeks, and on it goes for the 40 patients seen throughout the day.  Only those 5% to 10% of patients need referral.  That is deplorable.<\/p><p> The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, supports the creation of a single-tier secondary care system, underpinned by principles of solidarity, equity, fairness and efficiency.  We recommend that an all-party task force works with key health care stakeholders to consider the funding options that can deliver a single-tier system.<\/p><p> On emergency department overcrowding, chronic conditions become acutely uncontrolled because we are not looking after the patients appropriately.  Those patients end up in the emergency department and are then admitted on trolleys.  We are part of the solution.  GP-led chronic disease management, more step-down facilities, enhanced social care in the community, enhanced GP co-operative roles, and the development of primary palliative care packages will help.<\/p><p> We would like to alert the committee to the hazards of an increasingly fragmented, \"corporatised\", \"commoditised\" health care system.  For-profit corporations are targeting citizens and incentivising them to get investigations that might not be evidence based.  That destabilises the health care system and chronic disease management.  Effective public general practice and primary care is a proven way to add cohesion and continuity to a system which patients frequently experience as very frustrating.<\/p><p> In summary, a new GP contract with built in continual periodic review is essential to permit GP-led chronic disease management and build capacity.  The new contract must embrace the needs of patients with multi-morbidity, that is, multiple chronic illnesses.  It is essential to consolidate and build the numbers of GPs and practice nurses.

First, payment must cease to be a barrier to essential medical care such as general practice.  Second, with regard to universal use of electronic medical records, it would be welcome if it became illegal for every health care professional to write on paper from 2019.  Third, build capacity in primary care.  We have our ICGP strategy, which is mercifully short.  It is not rocket science.  It has been done in Denmark, Canada and in the United Kingdom.  They are even doing it in parts of America.  Fourth, fully establish chronic disease management in primary care.  Our hospitals are drowning in work that should be done in the communities.  They will never succeed and be effective at what they are designed to do unless that work is put where patients want it, which is close to their homes.  Fifth, support end of life care in the community.  Research done by the Irish Hospice Foundation sequentially during the past decade repeatedly shows that people want to be close to their community in their final weeks and months, but we do not do that.  We very expensively shunt them into the acute hospital system.  Sixth, if health insurers are allowed to continue to be active in the Irish economy, they must recognise primary care if they are licensed to operate.<\/p> <p>  Those are six quick wins.

Some 40% of the population have a medical card.  That is an acute care contract.  I cannot manage chronic diseases.  Patients would have to be charged.  In effect, patients have multiple chronic illnesses, so we are faced with managing their acute exacerbations.  Some 60% of the population have to pay for services.  That is outside the contract.  We need a new contract to specify and regulate how we can meaningfully manage chronic illnesses.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of chronic illnesses, we provided a narrative in our submission of a typical patient whom we called Mary Smith.  Dr. Liam McGlynn, an academic GP, has shown us that 66% of patients over 50 have multi-morbidity.  This patient has asthma, depression, arthritis, heart failure and ischemic heart disease.  She is on 13 or 14 medications.  There is psycho-social chaos going on in her life.  How do we meaningfully manage those diseases?  We can return to the clinical care programmes.

We manage all those conditions together.<\/p><p> The management of multi-morbidity has been cogently outlined in the evidence.  One needs to resource GPs to enable them manage all of these conditions together.  How that is done in the contract, through a weighted capitation for multi-morbidity and deprivation, can be addressed with those organisations, but the Government needs to resource us.  There are also guidelines for managing all of those illnesses when they occur together.  Multi-morbidity is a key concept.  We would like to get back involved in those processes.

When we look at the numbers, for example, those who have hypertension or high blood pressure, we say that in 2014 approximately 800,000 patients had hypertension.  When we project forward to 2020, we expect that number to have increased to almost 1.2 million patients.  These patients then are at risk of other illnesses and diseases.  It is important that we target them at the primary care level with the GP at the core - the GP is the centre of primary care - to try to reduce the burden of this disease because although patients are living longer, the burden of chronic disease on these patients means that their quality of life is dramatically reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Noonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Dr. O'Shea might clarify this.

Obamacare is the switch-on of community-based primary care.  There is the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, which is an umbrella group that has quickly gathered a considerable volume of information from a variety of different sub-systems in the United States, and there is clear objective evidence that it is effective and there are clear guidelines in terms of how it works.

The answer we get is a very comprehensive one, a nice round figure of zero.  With regard to the delegates' vision for a primary care resource or centre that works, do they believe there is a need to establish a certain ratio of patients to health care professionals?

Consider the circumstances when patients present at an early, undifferentiated stage of illness, often with vague symptoms.  If we do not have access to diagnostic facilities, it is very difficult to diagnose anything.<\/p> <p>  At the back of the circulated pack, there are results of a study produced earlier this year by the Irish Cancer Society and Irish College of General Practitioners earlier this year.  It compares the effects of access to diagnostic facilities in the public and private systems.  Currently, the waiting periods for chest X-rays are quite similar, at a day or two.  For a private ultrasound scan, there is a five-day waiting list.  For a public ultrasound scan, there is an 80-day waiting list.  For a CT scan of the brain, chest or abdomen, a private patient must wait for less than a week while a public patient must wait up to 55 days.  Accessing an MRI scan privately takes from five to six days.  Accessing an MRI brain scan in the public system takes 125 days.  In any civilised, decent, fair society, this cannot be right.<\/p> <p>  With regard to who has access, 20% of GPs do not even have access to ultrasound facilities.

Thus, if a GP requests an investigation, it will not be put to the back of the system if an emergency patient walks in.  There should be a separate budget for each case.<\/p> <p>  I have referred to one diagnostic type.  There is a blood test that can diagnose heart failure called the B-type natriuretic peptide, BNP, test.  Professor Ken McDonald, the HSE's clinical lead for the heart failure programme, has shown that heart failure costs Irish society &euro;660 million per annum, with a direct cost to the HSE of &euro;147 million.  BNP is a test that can diagnose heart failure quickly.  Where GPs have had rapid access, there has been a 30% reduction in the need for echocardiography and a 60% reduction in the need for a consultant review.  This ties in with other studies showing that only 30% to 40% of patients who go to heart failure clinics are actually diagnosed with heart failure.  This is because it can be very difficult to differentiate between heart failure and COPD, frailty or other illnesses.<\/p> <p>  I will outline exactly what heart failure is and what it does to patients.  It causes chronic fatigue, shortness of breath and anxiety.  People feel like they are drowning in their own fluids.  A six-month delay in diagnosis of heart failure leads to a 23% increase in unscheduled hospital admissions, with all their attendant costs.<\/p> <p>  At the back of the documentation circulated, there is a map that shows GP access to BNP testing throughout the country.  Those in the green category have access while those in the red category do not.  Over half of the GPs in the country do not have access to BNP testing for their patients, which leads to increased costs and worse outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Osborne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>To summarise, we do not have access to diagnostics.

We ask about HbA1C, if blood pressure is well controlled and whether the patient is taking aspirin or ACE inhibitors.

Obviously, a straightforward seven year old who has nothing wrong is one sort of patient, but then there is the diabetic with high blood pressure, missing a foot and various other things.  Are there any suggestions for how GPs would get paid relative to the complexity of illness of the patient in order that they get paid properly?  A GP might spend 30 minutes with a very complex patient and can get somebody else through in three minutes.  From last week's discussions I was inclined towards two different pay scales.

I must declare, I am a member of the Irish College of General Practitioners and have been since its foundation in 1986.  It has brought general practice out of the dark ages and into the 21st century and has been essential for the development of general practice.  It is involved in education, standards and research and training.  It is not involved in negotiating contracts, as Dr. Murphy has said.  I also compliment the ICGP on having brought young GPs in because we are seeing a profession whose members are ageing and it is good to see young GPs coming in and staying in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The most important aspect of general practice is the continuity of care that GPs provide to their patients.  We know their medical illnesses but we also know their psychological, social and financial backgrounds, which are all very important components of general practice.  Continuity of care is a critical component of general practice, and we want to maintain that.  Our first difficulty is that general practice and primary care are not properly funded.  Our second difficulty is that even if we were properly funded, there would still be a huge gap between the integration of primary care with secondary care.  We have heard of the Kilkenny model, which is working superbly, and it has been asked why all GPs and hospitals are not engaging.  It is a wonderful question because we should be engaging and there should be huge communication between primary care and secondary care.  That is the purpose of this committee, apart from bolstering primary care, namely, to bring about a situation of being able to integrate primary care and secondary care.  It is a terrible term, but there should be a seamless transition between primary and secondary care.  General practitioners look after their patients for 99% of their time.  In their lifetime, 1% of patients' time or even less may be spent in a hospital.  They go to hospital and they come back to us.  We are the people who look after them in their multi-morbidity state, and it is important to state that GPs look after multi-morbidity.  Patients go to the diabetic clinic and get tablets from that.  They go to the heart failure clinic and get tablets from that.  They go to all these clinics, and we are the people who integrate.<\/p> <p>  The solutions to our problem in devising a new system are recruitment and retention, increasing our bed capacity and increasing our access to diagnostics.

They can legislate for the electronic medical record and make the hospitals catch up with general practice.  They can legislate around a contract.  They can ring-fence funding for primary care.  We are not all that concerned about what stream it comes under, but it should be protected in order that our primary care system is funded at least in line with other OECD countries.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the insurance industry, members can legislate so that if insurers are to be allowed to operate in this space, they must recognise general practice.

Deputy Harty raised a very interesting point about whether there is an inevitable bulwark or obstruction between primary and secondary care.  In Ireland we do many things twice.  There is the private secondary care system and the public secondary care system.  We are concerned about our colleagues in the public hospital system because they are in a very difficult space, even as we are, and we feel that the majority of our specialist colleagues in the public hospital systems are absolutely equally demoralised about what is going on.  When we get an opportunity to talk to them, good things will happen.  We can see it in Carlow-Kilkenny, and several questioners have asked whether Carlow-Kilkenny is good or bad.  Carlow-Kilkenny is progress.  Carlow-Kilkenny is an improvement on what was.

We have had a high level of expertise come in and overview.  One of our advisers, Dr. Paul Grundy, who is a global expert in health system design, said that there was a blank space in the regional space, that in our practices we actually do good work.  At a national level we do good work now and we do good work in the college, but there is a vacuum in the regional space.  We can populate that.  The community health care organisations, CHOs, might be part of it if their terms and conditions are properly negotiated.  GP co-operatives are bigger than the standard GP practice of two to four GPs, so there are 140 GPs.  In my own co-operative in County Kildare, we have had a minor injuries service where we have really pushed suturing and have had access to out-of-hours trauma films.  We can leave the study for members to read.  GPs can do this, providing we can get away from being locked into face-time consulting.<\/p> <p>  The regionalisation vacuum significantly reflects the current General Medical Service, GMS, contract which has us handcuffed to 100% consulting all the time.  To go back to the Veterans' Administration, if the new contract to be given to us allows any of us to spend 20% or 30% of our time not locked in face-to-face consulting, we can liaise with the pharmacist, we can go to primary care team meetings and we can talk.  Carlow-Kilkenny has been built on the sweat of GPs and specialists who went to committee meetings and hammered it out.  They got some bit of flexibility from their funding manager.  The tragedy of Carlow-Kilkenny is that it is only Carlow-Kilkenny.

I am sure Dr. Noonan will develop and better some of my points.  Regarding integration, like all workers, we work based upon a contract, which must be operationalised by a union.  I am afraid to say that, but it is the way the world works.  If we are to take on work and integrate and communicate with our hospital colleagues in an improved way, which we should, that must be operationalised with unions.  That comes first but it must happen.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Connell, the multiple pharmacists I deal with day to day basis would be appalled if I did not say that they are absolutely the core trusted people in the primary care team.  I talk to them every day.  I apologise for that omission absolutely.  Regarding multi-morbidity, in the NHS there is a deprivation weighting in the capitation payment and a multi-morbidity weighting.  I could talk at length about the IT aspects that could be improved.  Our capitation can be weighted based on multi-morbidity.  It is done over there.  We can do it here.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Harty's second point about inverse incentives, the inverse care law, as he knows, is alive and well.  Care is not where it should be, as he said last week.<\/p><p>There is no perverse incentive in this regard.  We want GPs working with our deprived communities and multi-morbid populations, and I do not see any perverse incentive.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Connell's final point pertained to mental health and the &euro;5,000.  I will expand on this matter.  This is a typical reality.  We need universal health care.  At present, 40% of the population receives free GP care.  Those people get good quality care.  They have free access to primary care and counselling in primary care, which Dr. Osborne may speak about, but there is a nine-month waiting list.  This means that 60% of the population must pay to see me.  Someone who is severely depressed must come back frequently and pay for 12 or 14 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy.  This is not uncommon.  Both of these scenarios are completely untenable and involve Irish patients making catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, which is a technical academic term, which patients in other areas of Europe do not have to make.  These are the issues over which we lose sleep.  It is very difficult.<\/p><p> On the corporatisation element to which to Deputy Harty referred, we must operate on evidence.  We know publicly-funded general practice is the cheapest and most efficient way to manage care.  There are for-profit insurance companies and large corporate pharmacy chains trying to get into the market, and this is how they see it.  They see this as a market, and it must be stated on the record they see persons as consumers and they are trying to extract money from them.  The best way to manage health care is to enable GPs to manage illnesses and refer people to publicly-funded secondary care if possible.<\/p><p> It is very substandard.  The typical reality is people come to our practice with fancy medicals from corporatised health care environments, and it is left to us to put the pieces together, as Deputy Harty knows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I will look at a few of the areas Dr. Murphy has spoken about briefly.  Deputy Collins mentioned the idea of fragmented care and integration between primary and secondary care.  I will not speak about the Carlow-Kilkenny model again, but we need to think about this issue.  If we are reducing attendance and demand on secondary care it must be accompanied by a transfer of these resources into primary care, and this type of dynamic decision on the relocation of resources needs to be made.  If GPs are to conduct the care previously provided by hospital consultants and hospital-led clinics, they need to be resourced to do so.  They can do it once they are resourced.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy O'Connell's point on multi-morbidity capitation and remuneration, I am very concerned that anybody would think that GPs would target and hone in on patients with multi-morbidity issues or who live in areas of deprivation because they can make a quick buck on them.  This is not possible.  In most general practices, we see a wide range and diverse types of patients.  Certainly, most people walking into my waiting room will not know whether a patient is on the GMS and has a medical card or is private, or whether a child has an under six card or is seven years of age.  All patients sit in the same waiting room, are seen by the same doctor and nurse and are provided with the same care.  Issues arise when it comes to referring onwards.  Somebody with a medical card can access a service such as counselling in primary care.  Somebody with no medical card and no private insurance finds it very hard to access counselling.  There is no onward referral pathway for them to counselling in primary care because it requires a medical card.  This is when health inequalities exist.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned by the fact that we speak about patients who are more difficult and for whom we deserve more money.  Every patient becomes a different patient on a different today.  The patients who might take me three minutes this week could take me half an hour next week because something complex has happened in their lives.  As GPs, we know patients in the context of their physical, psychological and social backgrounds and these items cannot be disregarded.  They are so complex and so important.  Starting off in a new practice I do not know my families and patients very well yet, but I know that over the years I will develop this relationship and I will understand the patients better.  We cannot reduce patients to being either a complex or simple patient.  While there are indicators that people have complex comorbidities and may be more difficulty, a mental health issue may arise in a patient the GP has not predicted may become a complex patient.<\/p> <p>  Access to mental health is inequitable.  As I mentioned, patients who do not have a medical card cannot even be referred on to counselling in primary care.  This is quite a difficult situation.  Patients pay a lot of money to private counsellors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Noonan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I reiterate my apology to Deputy O'Connell.

The big danger is that if an empty wing in a hospital is used in time it will be taken over by the hospital and we will have the same type of blockages.  Is there a regional diagnostic centres model?  With regard to the input of the Irish College of General Practitioners into the contract, I accept what the witnesses have said, namely, that it is a policy-based organisation and not a trade union.  Given its policy base, however, is it keeping trade union representatives informed of the ratios that exist in GP practices?  I refer, for example, to the ratio of practice nurses to GPs?  Is the Irish College of General Practitioners having an input on what is the best model?  Has it identified premises as an issue that needs to be addressed in the contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#V00700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The question on whether we are inputting into the process of contract negotiations is critical.  Collectively, all of the stakeholders in the process have found entering negotiations, and doing so effectively for patients, has been historically very difficult.  Certainly the college understands in detail what is required to be done and, therefore, this is very germane to the contract negotiations.  Our information, knowledge and standards-based approach is available to the contract negotiation process.  Conversely, we would see it as bad for the contract if we were locked out of it.  This is the position of the Irish College of General Practitioners.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether there is a model of diagnostics that works, the problem is that several models work quite well elsewhere.  We must try not to fall down the fallacy of one size fits all.  A very important question related to access to diagnostics and why blockages happen is whether it is because of competition between different professional groupings.  We are not certain this is the case.  However, we do see - in a funding model that is so focused on the acute hospital system, where budgets are so protected regarding the hospital - that our patients in the community are perennially at the bottom of the queue.  It comes across in how budgets are disposed and managed by hospital-based managers who, regrettably, seem to view it on a short-term basis.  There are also the practicalities of it.  My local hospital does blood tests on an almost 24-hour basis but all of the samples in my practice must be taken between 9 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. on only four mornings each week because there is no blood collection on Fridays.  Trying to manage chronic diseases with patients who need ongoing monitoring requires us to have them all in before 11.30 a.m. on four days each week.<\/p><p>That is an operational decision which reflects hospital priorities.  One should not put oneself under significant pressure to get the contract right the first time.  There is a need to build in reviews.  This is a feature of the more effective systems that we have studied.  People must determine what is working and what is not every 18 months.  The Irish health system is paper based, so our data are usually two or three years behind.  In general practice, we will deliver real-time data that will allow one to finesse the next round of contract negotiations.  Historically, that process has been adversarial and competitive and has ignored the patient.  We need to move to a truly collaborative system.  If this committee can help us to do that, it will have done great work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Browne's point.  As a thought experiment, let us say that there are 2,000 General Medical Services, GMS, lists out there.  If there are too few general practitioners, GPs, and someone returning from Australia wants to start as a GP and picks a town in rural Ireland, an inner city deprived area or anywhere that does not have one, what would logically happen?  A wonderful thing happened a few years ago, in that the GMS lists were opened up.  That was long overdue.  I can now get a GMS list.  Starting on zero patients, my overheads for a premises, staff and equipment would be astronomical and my income would be zero in the first year.  We need more GPs.  Dr. Noonan has taken over a new list and I am thinking of doing the same, but what we really need is for GPs to set up from scratch and take on patients when more persons enter the system and get GP access cards.  That is a major risk, though.  There is no capital for GPs to do this.  While it is great that the medical card system has opened up, in reality only a handful of my friends throughout the country have done so because it is financially the most loss-making decision that one could ever make for one's family.  GPs have done it only to emigrate.  We need to consider capital incentives for this situation.  That is important.  If a premises is rent free, for example, it makes a great deal of sense.  If a GP can take over a premises and pay the rent, that will also be okay.  We do not need to have a fixed position on that issue, but we need to support that GP from a capital point of view so that he or she can work in that environment.

We sense their interest and knowledge.  They have become somewhat expert in the inverse care law, so I will not restate it.  However, there is a corollary.  Dr. Julian Tudor Hart, a Welsh GP, stated that the impact of the inverse care law is most destructive where health care was commercialised, that is, where commercial influences are allowed to operate in the economy.  In certain respects, we are seeing that here in terms of the corporatisation of general practice, cherry-picking and rationing that happens in those kinds of health care systems.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman has asked me to wind down, so I will.  It can be done, and we are sending the committee a copy of this.  It is evidence from the US, which we have not looked on as a leading model in primary care but which has generated evidence in the past ten years.  It is actually inspiring stuff and we would regard it as required reading for members.<br\/><br\/>We have done a quixotic thing, in that we asked the patient what he or she thought.  This is a study of 600 patients with complex comorbidities.  The data were gathered in community pharmacies by the Adelaide Health Foundation.  When we asked the patients where they would like their chronic disease management to be done, they overwhelmingly stated that they would like it to be done in a GP-led service in the community.  They did not rate as highly a consultant-led service in the hospital or in the community.  They wanted it to be done by GPs and, to some extent, practice nurses.  There is a great deal of useful data.  Some of it is hurtful in terms of the inequalities that come across.  I wish to refer to one sad paper by Professor Ivan Perry <i>et al<\/i>that examines the extent to which we carry out lower extremity amputations on our diabetic patients.  It is a key marker of how good we are at chronic disease management.  The paper notes that, between 2005 and 2009 in the UK, the number of such amputations per 100,000 diabetics decreased from 275 to 250.  That was with an older population.  In Ireland, it increased from 144 to 175.  We are failing at chronic disease management in a bad way.  There are other papers of which the committee is aware.  We were asked about Dr. Margaret O'Riordan's paper, so I will not reference it, and I have here is Dr. Liam Glynn's paper on complex comorbidities.<br\/><br\/>There have been some wins.  Carlow-Kilkenny has been inspiring.  There was an engagement approximately a year and a half ago when we communicated to the Minister of the day the need to move ahead on chronic disease management, and there was a small piece of progress as a result.  A cycle of care for diabetic care was introduced through the appropriate channel.  It is a small start, so may we please accelerate it?  Chronic disease management in patients attending a general practice setting amounts to 9.2 visits per year and most of the care delivered by GPs.  Of those 9.2 consultations, only 1.7 were delivered by the practice nurse.  If the Government delivers a new contract that merely allows us to turn that around, we will begin to imitate systems that are more effective and less expensive.  What we are doing has a shocking cost in terms of more complex chronic diseases being diagnosed lately and managed far less efficiently.<br\/><br\/>A number of lovely studies have been done in practice that illustrate what GPs can do, that we can intervene in breast-feeding rates in antenatal care and that we can check the weight of children and parents are welcoming of it.  They have been done by registrars, many of whom have left the system.  We wonder whether they will ever return.  We will leave the committee with a copy of these.<br\/><br\/>I thank members for listening to us.  I hope that we have not spilled over too much into their time.  We wish them the very best success because we are all depending on one another in this regard.  We are going to turn into the people with complex comorbidities.  We sincerely hope that the system can become kinder to us when our time comes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016092800002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentation and for addressing all of our questions so thoroughly.

I am married to &Aacute;ine and we have three children, all of whom are boys and are now very much grown up.  I am a retired second level teacher; I taught English.  I have been involved with Irish Water Safety in one way or another for more than 40 years - far too long.  Members will have seen from my submission that I became involved initially in 1971.<\/p><p>From being involved in Ireland I became involved at a European level where I was voted in as chair of the International Life Saving Rescue Commission.  That would have been in the 1990s.  That was followed by a significant number of years in that position before I was elected as a member of the board of directors of the International Life Saving Federation in the European region.  This year I was voted as a member of the board for the world body of the International Life Saving Federation.  Until then I was chairman of the International Life Saving world body rescue commission.  The amount of time spent in the area is quite considerable, as the committee can see, and it has been a gradual process.  I do not come from the left or right wing and I have made the gradual step up from being involved as an instructor, teaching life-saving and swimming, to the present point.  I continue voluntarily to teach life-saving.<\/p><p> The Irish Water Safety organisation was established in 1945 as a section of the Red Cross.  It grew and became the Irish Water Safety Association in 1971, which was around the same time I became involved.  In 1987 we were amalgamated with the road and fire safety bodies to become the national safety council.  We were very glad to be reappointed as a national body, standing in our own right, in 2000 by means of a statutory instrument.  We are an independent statutory voluntary body, which is an unusual combination.  We have hard-working staff in our headquarters in Galway, with more than 4,000 volunteer members nationwide.  In many ways, our job is to teach.  The volunteers teach swimming and life-saving.  Our headquarters staff are involved with educating people by means of the media to have best practice when it comes to water safety.  We teach swimming and life-saving, with a significant number of public safety awareness programmes and campaigns in place.  In each county we have water safety area committees.  We also have two dedicated committees, with one in the Curragh for the Army and the other in Templemore for the Garda.  Our water safety area committees have what is called a water safety development officer, WSDO, linking the area committees with the local authority.  They are paid officials.<\/p><p> Without a shadow of a doubt, our strongest asset is our volunteer network.  The core volunteers teach a winter programme, usually beginning at this time of year and going right through until approximately Easter.  There is a summer programme where our volunteers go to the beaches, outdoor pools, rivers and lakes to teach swimming and life-saving.  This system is unique in Europe, as we send volunteers out to teach swimming and life-saving across the nation and outdoors.  It is quite normal to have it taught indoors but we do it outdoors, on every little beach, river and lake throughout the country.  We train and assess lifeguards.  We do not hire them, as that is up to either the local authority or the individual private company that might employ lifeguards in a leisure centre.<\/p><p> One of our biggest and most important tasks is carrying out risk assessments.  Irish Water Safety developed the risk assessment system now in place across Europe, which has proven a great success.  We work, in that context, very closely with An Taisce and Blue Flag, for example, ensuring that a beach getting a flag must be risk assessed.  Part of our work is the primary aquatic water safety, PAWS, programme, which has been accepted by the Department of Education and Skills as part of the primary schools curriculum.  There were 55,000 certificates issued last year to primary schoolchildren who took part.  I recognise, as incoming chairman, that much more work must be done to get the PAWS programme in place in all primary schools throughout the country.<\/p><p> Statistics for drownings in Ireland indicate that much work remains to be done.  As the committee is probably aware, there were 122 drownings in 2015, with 66 of those being accidental.  The rest are covered under the headings of \"suicide\" and \"undetermined\".  The number of accidental drownings increased from previous years, which reminds us that the job goes on and we cannot accept such numbers.  A few years ago we saw a significant decrease in the numbers drowned, and although there have not been too many serious changes, the number of 66 deaths last year was above average.<\/p><p> In that context, we must get people from the fishing industry involved, whether they are on the sea or off the rocks, and try to get across the message that they should wear life jackets.  We work in conjunction with the other agencies, including the Coast Guard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to get the message across with a particular focus on the fishing community and anybody involved.  If we consider the statistics over the years, we can see a greater number of people drown inland than do offshore or on our beaches.<\/p><p> Looking forward, it is necessary for us to continue to make the public aware of the dangers.  We must increase the number of people we are getting to with the PAWS programme and also in our summer weeks programme, where we teach on the beaches.  We need to get all the children involved.  It is wonderful to go to places and remote regions and realise that every child is participating.  That is the case in quite a number of rural areas, as they do not have access to swimming pools.  They use the time to teach the children to swim and be capable of self-rescue and the rescuing of others.  I thank all the volunteers and our hard-working staff in our headquarters in Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475051400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for attending before the committee and outlining his vast experience in the water safety sphere.

Most parents ensure their children learn to swim.  I have never learned to swim but I have ensured that my children can swim.  I will address my inability to swim.  It is crucial that people are aware of water safety.  There are swimming pools where I live, so people go to the pool all the time and not to beaches.  With the weather in Ireland, it is a little bit tricky and people must make hay while the sun shines.  It is the 4,000 unknown volunteers who do so much work that are always forgotten about.  I agree with colleagues that education is the biggest gift that we can give anyone.  Educating people in schools, at pools and at beaches is important because, like everything in life, something simple can catch a person off guard thus leading to the loss of a loved one.<\/p> <p>  How is Irish Water Safety funded?  What role can we, as members, play in assisting the organisation?  Again, I compliment the organisation.  It is so important that people are made aware of all the dangers posed by pools and beaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#F00600","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475051400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The first question was on dedicated training.  We have lifesaving training centres at Tramore, County Waterford, White Strand, County Clare, in Kildare and I believe there is one about to be built in Wexford.  Waterford led the way with a centre located at Tramore.  It is an excellent building that has all the necessary facilities.  The centres have improved the lot of the people involved in training beach guards.  It means people can now go to the centre and avail of the beach next door.  In the past, when people arrived in cars, they had to carry equipment long distances.  The establishment of training centres has been an excellent improvement.  The Clare people are looking to build another centre and we need to get one in Cork.  Over the next few years, we expect to have a significant number of training centres.  Perhaps not all of them will be of the same quality as the Waterford centre but they will be of a high standard.<\/p> <p>  We would welcome funding for centres from wherever.  The people of Waterford and Clare did a serious amount of fund-raising for their centres.  In most cases, it is a question of getting out there and raising money in order to build a station.  The centres would have got moneys, and we hope to get more, from local authorities.  Please bear in mind that we train the beach guards, so that they can operate on the beaches during the summertime.<\/p> <p>  We need to develop more lifesaving programmes for inland locations.  A minority of our week long summer programmes are taught in rivers and lakes but the greater number are taught at beaches.  There is an excellent summer programme of education on water safety at some of the lakes in County Cavan and likewise at rivers in places like Tipperary.  <\/p> <p>  We must convey the message to parents but especially to children about water safety and that is where the PAWS programme comes in.  The PAWS programme has been designed in such a way that the early sections of it can be done without going to a swimming pool.  It is an water safety education process for primary school children.  Teachers can look at our website and click on the link for the PAWS programme where they will find excellent lesson plans designed to cater for children at different levels.<\/p><p>They will also find excellent worksheets for the children, all of which have been designed by teachers, which the children can enjoy completing and which will teach them various lessons.  We are very much aware that our PAWS programme has not gone to a sufficient number of primary schools and that we must get it out to them.  We have an education officer in our headquarters and he will be working hard to ensure that the programme is in place in a far greater number of primary schools.<\/p><p> I forget the other question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475051400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>What are the budget resources?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#G00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1475051400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Is it just local government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#G00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475051400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>The Department grant amounts to just over &euro;500,000.

Clearly, one is the inland waterways and the message we must convey in that regard.  One can look at cases of people who drown after going out on a lake in a small boat.  Just a couple of days ago there was a near-drowning incident in Killarney lakes, where waves can be quite different from the type of waves experienced on a beach.  In that particular incident, all of the people were wearing life jackets, so they all survived.  That is the message.  We have just started conveying that message through the media advising that with life jackets, the message is in the name - \"life jacket\".  We will continue to try to convey to people that they should never be in or near the water without wearing a life jacket.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is fishermen, and the answer is the same.  The number of drownings has reduced a little in recent years.  Thankfully, it has improved due to wearing the life jacket.  There was a time some years ago when fishermen simply did not wear life jackets.  We used to run summer week programmes in places such as Castletownbere and when we looked at the classes we realised that they were almost all female because the boys were going fishing.  That has changed and we have both boys and girls involved in learning to swim, how to self rescue and how to rescue other people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2016092800002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1475051400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. O'Sullivan, for your assistance to the committee this morning and for travelling up last night to attend.

It is quite a daunting experience to appear before a joint committee of our national Parliament and we thought long and hard about how we would prepare for this meeting.  We looked at the Oireachtas website but found it difficult to find accessible committee information.  We do not even have full access to the Parliament itself.  I know that Senators and Deputies generally prefer communication by phone but that is also a struggle for us.  I thought it important to say that before addressing the main subject of this meeting.<\/p> <p>  The recognition of Irish Sign Language can affect people at a personal level right up to State level.  In terms of access to health services, for example, if there are no qualified interpreters available, people may be relying on family members to avail of health services.  In some instances, they may seek services of a sensitive nature about which they do not want their families to know.  At a State level, while there is some access to interpretation in criminal cases, in civil cases such access often depends on the goodwill of the presiding judge.  Often deaf people find themselves paying for interpretation in civil court cases.  It would be great to be able to give the committee an understanding of the depth of experiences but I will try to be as concise as possible this morning.<\/p> <p>  Historically, there has been a negative attitude towards the use of sign language in Ireland.  Families were advised by health care professionals to avoid signing to people who were born deaf and to focus instead on written communication or speech.  That would have been the experience of many families throughout the country.  However, Irish Sign Language is such an expressive and a beautiful language which could greatly enhance family life.  That was my own experience and while I get on very well with my family, I still meet family members who do not believe in the idea of signing early.  They still think that it should not be implemented straight away with deaf children.  <\/p> <p>  Before this meeting began, we were discussing incidental knowledge.<\/p><p>I was told by a person over the age of 60 years that he suffered a heart attack.  He had no idea that there was a family history of cardiac conditions.  His family were not communicating with him through Irish Sign Language and because of that, he was missing out on shared information.  We have been working with Senator Mark Daly to try to look at ways to progress recognition of Irish Sign Language, so that professionals and families will actually see the value of having the language.  Sometimes it is seen as a language that is just tolerated and is not properly recognised as being a basic right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Bosco Conama","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Let me again mention the fact that a person did not know about the family medical history because of the poor communication in the family.  I am in a different situation because my parents are deaf and we all communicate through sign language.  That is great because I have access to my family but as a deaf person, I still experience oppression in terms of access to communicating.  I have access to my parents because they are deaf too.  I have siblings who are hearing but we all sign.  I went into an education system that tried to force me to speak.  I would often try to figure out what was being said or we would spend time trying to advise each other what the teacher was saying because we could not necessarily make it out.  At the age of six, seven and eight years, I was not allowed to utter a word in sign language while I was in school.  When I left school, I went on to third level education which was such a difference from my experience at primary and secondary schools.  At third level, I was provided with sign language interpretation, I could ask questions and have them answered through sign language and it always made me wonder why I spent my time in primary and secondary schools guessing what was being said.  I was able to access the world when I was so much older.  Why would it make sense to wait until I was 22 or 23 years before I could access the world?  Even saying that I had access in university, there is still not 100% access in the world in general.<\/p> <p>  I wish to give members an idea of how things are and of the differences.  We would often struggle in relation to interpretations.  In terms of meetings, we would worry about the availability of an interpreter.  Will the interpreter turn up and how will we be able to express ourselves if the interpreter fails to turn up?  That is our primary focus instead of focusing on coming to a meeting and worrying about the content of our contribution, we are often worried about the access arrangements and the barriers we will face.  We are looking at Irish Sign Language as a means to bridge the barriers to communication and as a way to be able to connect with each other.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Brian Crean.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Wendy Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Our department deals with about 500 deaf adults.  They would often say  they felt access was not good in terms of their experience in education.  If they went to a vocational or other school, they would have felt left out perhaps because there was no interpretation available.  We would have had 500 students of whom 71% would be unemployed.  That comes down to the disability allowance system.<\/p> <p>  The disability allowance is good in some ways but it encourages people to remain on the disability allowance.  It does not motivate people to get going and try to get back into doing things.  I would have grown up in a hearing family.  I got on well but my family would have taken the advice from the State about it not being good to use sign language straight away.  The three of us who are representing the deaf community, and 93% of people in the deaf community, would say that if they had the chance to go back and be educated again, they would choose to be educated through Irish Sign Language from the very beginning.  That is the reason we come looking for recognition for Irish Sign Language.  We hope that in time, other children will not experience a repetition of our experiences but that the system will be able to remove the oppression that happened before in order that it is not repeated.  We want to ensure there is access to ISL from the very beginning for deaf children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Crean"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>My parents are over the age of 70 years and they have experienced a great degree of oppression.  They would not have had the opportunity to have felt like full citizens.  They would not have had the experience of privileged access to information that hearing people would have, like the members of the committee.  It often makes me think there are barriers in society in terms of very minor things we would find out that we do not have access to and we feel it is really important that recognition of Irish Sign Language, as a language, is a way for the system to change for the better, to offer another route where there is not that cycle of exclusion, marginalisation and oppression.  It is almost like there is a wall surrounding us because our language is not recognised but if that wall were to be removed, we would be able to communicate, understand and have people understand us more easily.<\/p> <p>  Before we came to this committee meeting, we looked at a video clip of Bressie when he made a presentation on mental health to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to get an idea of what it is like to appear before a committee as a witness.  We only had access to that because were using the interpreter this morning.  It was not accessible to us immediately.  I know it has been mentioned already but in terms of accessing health services, there is an expectation that a deaf person would be accompanied by a family member.  The professionals would not think of providing a professional sign language interpreter in many cases.  If one is bringing in somebody who is not a professional interpreter, does he or she necessarily understand what is being said in terms of the terminology that is being used or will he or she try to shelter the deaf person because they think it is for the best?  The non-professional interpreter would often leave out vital information that the deaf person should know because he or she thinks it is best for them.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at society as being the cause of many barriers.  What I worry about is the state of services for me as an older deaf person and how it will impact on my mental health.  We are asking whether the system can be broken down, so that it is not stay the same.  I would hate to think that in 50 years' time, the situation will be the same and that by the time I am buried, nothing will have improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Wendy Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Thinking about the luxury of access, even people who are in dire situations, who are self-harming have access to a helpline, they can telephone somebody.

We have worked with officials in the Oireachtas to draft this legislation.  This Bill has been put together with the assistance of Dr. Conama and others.  It covers a wide range of topics, including the recognition of Irish Sign Language and the rights of the members of the deaf community.  Dr. Conama referred briefly to access to this Parliament.  When Brian Crowley, MEP became a Member of the Seanad, he could not get into the Chamber because there was no wheelchair access.  We brought in legislation over time to ensure everyone would be able to access public buildings.  We argued that access should not be provided on a case-by-case basis, but should be based on legislation.  Similarly, I am proposing in my Bill that members of the deaf community should be given access to services and to the national broadcaster and that service providers should be obliged to provide access in the same way that we now provide access to people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of the importance of putting this in legislation.  Funding for the advocacy service for members of the deaf community was cut some years ago.  I was contacted by people who wanted the matter to be raised in the D&aacute;il Chamber and I asked our Leader to do so.  Two hundred members of the deaf community wanted to come into the Public Gallery on the day this was due to happen, but they needed interpreters.  We asked the Ceann Comhairle's office to ensure an interpreter was made available and put on the floor of the D&aacute;il, but we were told this could not be done.  We were advised that members of the deaf community could go to the audiovisual room, where an interpreter could be provided.  These members of the deaf community were unable to go to the Public Gallery like other citizens.  When this row became public, the head of communications in the Oireachtas at the time was not pleased that it became public that no interpreter was available.  He wanted to meet me and members of the deaf community.  We went into a meeting.  We sat down and he explained his displeasure and set out the plans for the use of the audiovisual room.  After five minutes, I asked why the services of an interpreter were not being provided at a meeting with the head of communications.  The other people at the meeting had no idea what he had been saying.  It dawned on him that it was a question of citizens of Ireland not being able to access the Parliament of Ireland.  As it turned out, interpreters were put into the D&aacute;il Chamber for the benefit of the members of the deaf community who were in the Public Gallery.  The advocacy funding was reinstated.  That was a clear example of how the hearing community has no concept of how difficult life is for members of the deaf community.  Everyone has the right to access a doctor who can interpret what one's symptoms are.  If one has to write down what is wrong with one when one goes to the doctor, that is simply not acceptable in life-and-death situations.<\/p> <p>  My Bill was introduced on two occasions during the last D&aacute;il, but unfortunately it was defeated on both occasions.  It was explained to us that we firstly needed to take all the steps in relation to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by passing that, then all the other bits and pieces would be brought in on a piecemeal basis, and then consideration might be given to recognising Irish Sign Language.  We were told there would be no need for recognition at that stage because everything would have been done.  That could take decades because there is no obligation on anyone to provide such services.  It would be too piecemeal.  Some things have been done in certain Departments.  In fairness to the former Minister for Social Protection, she put in place a system to ensure interpreters would be made available for members of the deaf community while interacting with her Department.  That happened because of her own personal experiences.  It is not a wideranging policy across the Government.  The Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 would oblige the Government over time to enable members of the deaf community to be able access Government services, the national broadcaster and others.  The Bill has been published and placed on the Seanad Order Paper.  We hope it will debated and the Minister will support it.  However, he did not outline this as one of his three priorities when he launched the Bill.  However, it is a priority for the deaf community.  There is a disconnect in this regard.  I hope that with the assistance of members, we can push this Bill forward and get it passed during the current D&aacute;il term.  We need to understand that it can be difficult for the deaf community to access Government services.  Indeed, it is virtually impossible for a member of the deaf community to visit this Parliament to see what is going on here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#C00700","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning and giving such effective presentations.

An attitude began to develop in the 19th century that sign language was not a real language.  Research in Holland and America in the 1960s showed that the linguistic features of sign language are the same as the linguistic features of any language.  Such features exist in sign language too.<\/p><p>Since the 1960s, not one piece of research has been produced which indicates that sign languages are not valid languages.  Sometimes people suggest that sign languages are unable to deal with abstract concepts and so on, which is not the case either.  As a deaf sign language user, I find that spoken languages are more limited in what they can do than the visual language we use.   <\/p><p> The Department of Education and Skills allowed the school systems to run in its own way and the idea that prevailed was that if spoken languages were used and if the oral education system was used, deaf people would better integrate in society.  The opposite is the case when this occurs. <\/p><p> Mr. Crean referred to a conference that took place in Milan in 1880, at which the removal of sign language from the education system was discussed.  Some 210 international educators attended and they thought it was a good idea to get rid of sign language.<\/p><p> On the second question, children should have access to Irish Sign Language at the earliest possible time.  If one looks around, one will find classes for baby signs, which are targeted at hearing children who will eventually be able to speak.  We do not have the same attitude towards deaf children.  Hearing children should learn to sign as early as possible but deaf children should not learn to sign as early as possible.  The obvious thing about early access for hearing children is the language processing benefits arising from having access to language.  These benefits are also available for deaf children.  The answer to the question, therefore, is that children should have access to Irish Sign Language as early as possible. <\/p><p> On the third question, sign languages vary throughout the world.  There are approximately 6,000 spoken languages in the world and perhaps 300 or 400 sign languages, depending on the countries.  Irish Sign Language is used in the South whereas British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language are used in the North due to historical developments.  My experience when I visit other countries is sometimes similar to the experience a hearing person will have when travelling abroad.  If one has some familiarity with a language, one can make out bits and pieces, depending on how much one knows beforehand.  Sign languages are different, for example, in terms of syntax and structure, different hand shapes and different ways of expressing words may be used.  Despite these different linguistic structures, we may be able to catch up and pick up on them.  Ms Murray has a point to make on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Bosco Conama","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>On going abroad, I did a year abroad at Gallaudet University in the United States.

It is the only liberal arts university in the world for deaf people.  I have been there also and when I went for the first time I had no concept that sign languages were different.  I had always assumed they were exactly the same everywhere.  When I visited Gallaudet University it took me a little time to pick up the language, perhaps a week, and start to get a grip in terms of my receptive and understanding skills.  My expressive skills took two or three years to develop.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how early children should sign, I agree with the idea that they should sign from the moment they are born.<\/p> <p>  To go off topic slightly, in terms of society in general, we got to where we are now because the attitude was that if a child who is deaf signs, he or she will not learn to speak.  The focus was on removing sign language from the equation to get deaf children to learn to speak.  However, sign language is the only fully accessible language for deaf children.  Once they are exposed to sign language, they can acquire that regardless of what goes on separate from that.  I have two hearing children and their first language was Irish Sign Language.  When public health nurses visited us, they said our children would probably not learn to speak properly because we were signing with them.  I remember telling them that in the case of parents who were Irish speakers, which is also a completely different language, public health nurses visiting Gaelgeoir&iacute; would never tell them that their children might never learn to speak English properly.  They do not do that.  Having access to Irish Sign Language does not lead to the development of any intellectual impediments.  We ask, therefore, that the system take this into account and understand the richness of Irish Sign Language. <\/p> <p>  People may or may not develop the ability to speak but that is a completely separate issue and one on which the use of Irish Sign Language does not have any impact.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Crean"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive and insightful presentation.

As I know Mr. Byrne is one of the top interpreters, I wanted him to perform this role to ensure this opportunity was not wasted and that we did not have to worry about whether we were being understood.<\/p> <p>  Ireland does not have a national register of interpreters, nor do we have an accreditation or vetting process.  Trinity College Dublin provides interpreter training but there is no monitoring after graduation.  This can also be a missed opportunity.  The way we see it is that the qualification is a starting point but there is no continuing professional development programmes available for interpreters.  This means the matter is left to the interpreters, who mainly work freelance, and they often leave the profession over time.  <\/p> <p>  In an ideal world, the chairperson should have been able to give somebody the role of booking an interpreter.

Do its proposals extend beyond the issues of accessibility and recognition for Irish Sign Language?  Does it, for example, propose mechanisms for sharing the language within the hearing community?  As important as it is to take a step forward by giving recognition to Irish Sign Language, society must also engage more with the language, whether through people working as interpreters or through children who are in school with other children who are deaf.  If Irish Sign Language were shared beyond the deaf community and across society, it would have a key role to play in breaking down the extreme marginalisation that exists.<\/p><p>I wonder if there is provision for that.

It is very true that Irish Sign Language belongs to Irish society rather than to the deaf community only.  It is part of our country.  However, people may not have had exposure to it all the time.  Attitude and understanding are the two really important aspects.  They need to be progressed with regard to bringing forward access.  Family members need to have access to learning Irish Sign Language.  The gentleman with the heart condition, whose family did not have clear access and communication with him, was missing out on the incidental information.

It would benefit the deaf community in Ireland but it would also mean that hearing people would have the proper opportunity to learn the language.  Their learning the language would help us to change attitudes.

I have seen the parents of hearing children lobbying to try to get access to Irish Sign Language for their children.  It is amazing to think there are hearing children who, because the focus is different, get so much more access to Irish Sign Language than deaf children.  Often, the focus with deaf children is that we should try to get them to speak and when or if the speech does not work or when they \"fail\" - and I use that word in quotation marks - then that is the point where we can start to allow Irish Sign Language into the picture.  It is about waiting until they fail out of the other system.  Then the Irish Sign Language becomes something that will do for those children.  Some parents want to learn Irish Sign Language for their own benefit.  Their children may or may not want to speak a bit, but the parents want to be able to communicate with other deaf people around their children.

I know we have spoken before about cases in the courts system, for example, and I have had to deal with someone who was excluded because they are deaf and could not understand what was going on.  The witnesses have also raised previously the outrageous case of two co-accused - one of whom was asked to sign for the other and give the message back - one could not make this up that this would be deemed acceptable in a court of law.

We try to follow the international rule of thumb that there is in or about one deaf sign language user to every 1,000 of the population.  If we have a population of 4.5 million people, we are talking about approximately 4,500 deaf sign language users.  However, according to the census, we have 72,000 deaf or severely hearing-impaired people listed, approximately 19,000 of whom are under the age of 50.  I wonder if those who are under the age of 50 are sign language users.  If one breaks down the big group, approximately one quarter, or 19,000, would be right.<\/p> <p>  The way the question was asked in the census was not very clear.  It asked how many people used sign language.  There figure was approximately 3,500 but they were mostly hearing.  I think that it is very much under-reported.  If one were to compare it with Scotland or New Zealand, which have similar populations, Scotland has 12,000 British Sign Language users.  These are people who use British Sign Language at home.  We have 3,500.  In New Zealand, there are 20,000 sign language users.  There is obviously something going on in terms of the answering of that question and how it is being filled in.  We are looking at there being maybe 20,000 to 50,000 people who use Irish Sign Language regularly.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Crean has just reminded me about the question on interpretation and the number of interpreters.  Off the top of my head, I would say there are approximately 60 or 70 interpreters.  These would be freelance people who often leave or who get summer work and then come back and do bits and pieces.  Internationally, 60 would be seen as an incredibly low number for our population.  In Finland, there are 500 Finnish sign language interpreters on the register.  We have 60 to 70 qualified interpreters.  That is the historic number of qualified interpreters.  It is not the number of people who are actively on the register as such.  Mr. Crean is also saying to me that, in Finland, they would say that 500 is not enough.

Sometimes parents are not encouraged to sign with their children and instead are encouraged to try to get them to speak first.  Then the view is that if speech is not working out, Irish Sign Language is something that we can use.  However, the European Union of the Deaf, EUD, and the World Federation of the Deaf, WFD, have carried out research showing that sign language is the key and that the key to success is provision of sign language as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Crean"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I wish to add a comment.

The Chairman asked me to address issues and challenges for the Policing Authority in the short and medium term.  I will keep them brief and will be happy to develop the themes further in our conversation.<\/p> <p>  It is important to crystallise the role of the Policing Authority which is best captured by the Long Title of the Bill.  It is about \"overseeing the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services\".  We have a long list of specific tasks, but overseeing performance is the umbrella under which all tasks take place.  As the Chairman said, the authority is not quite nine months old; therefore, I am quite certain that we have not yet identified anything like the full list of issues, problems and challenges we are likely to encounter in the coming years.  As one of my colleagues said, our job is a marathon, not a sprint, which is an appropriate description.<\/p> <p>  We have all the issues and tasks one would expect a start-up to have - staff, logistics, authority governance, providing basic public information, too much to do and not enough time to do it.  Headway has been made under all these headings, but we are conscious that they will always be a work in progress.  <\/p> <p>  Start-up issues for the authority were compounded by a set of statutory requirements with fixed or implicit timelines for our first year of operation and at our first meeting the authority decided that meeting these requirements was not optional for a variety of reasons, not least ensuring public confidence in this new institution.  They include the following \"must dos\", all of which have either been achieved or are well advanced: having meetings with the Garda Commissioner in public - the fourth such meeting will take place tomorrow and we will have another in November; developing and publishing our strategy statement - it was laid before the Oireachtas in July and circulated to committee members recently; approving the Garda strategy statement, which was recently consented to by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality; developing policing priorities for 2017 - they will shortly be sent to the Minister for approval; working with the Garda Commissioner to develop the policing plan for 2017 which must be formally submitted to us before November; and developing a code of ethics for the Garda by 31 December 2016.  These are not light tasks, but they all have have to be done in year one, which means that there is not much room left for discretionary work.  I will return to the latter two topics, but I assure the committee that, thanks to the huge personal commitment of authority members and the chief executive officer and her team, we have achieved a great deal in a short time.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, the authority also decided as a matter of principle to be as transparent as possible in everything it did and to develop the public facing parts of our functions as quickly as we could.  In addition to public meetings with the Garda Commissioner, there have been two rounds of public consultations on the code of ethics; we invited public comment on our strategy and hosted the first meeting for many years of chairmen of joint policing committees for many and will do so again; we held a very successful consultation day with stakeholder representatives and have published all of our governing documents and minutes.  Since the authority's establishment, we have also received a number of formal referrals from the Minister which have to take their place on the priority list.<\/p> <p>  There is a long list of challenges, some of which I will mention.  An ongoing and understandable challenge is to \"establish\" the authority in the fullest sense of the word.  By this I mean we have to register the authority as a legitimate stakeholder in the realm of policing, including in the mind of the public, and to establish its authority.  The statutory framework for Garda oversight and accountability, as I am sure the committee is discovering given its work programme, is complex, with many actors.  Clarifying where we fit in and developing an understanding among stakeholders of the full scope of our functions and an appreciation of the value of a more transparent and timely oversight regime will be a work in progress for some time.<\/p> <p>  Overseeing policing performance is the core of the authority's statutory remit.  Our greatest challenge in the short and medium term probably is to establish a performance framework to enable us to assess the performance of the Garda.  We are working with the force using the statutory cycle of the policing plan to begin to establish performance targets which are more specific and measurable than in the past.  It is our intention that next year&rsquo;s plan will contain some measurable targets and baselines and that in the future we will build from there.  We will need to understand the links between policing priorities and resource deployment and consider it essential that progress be made in deepening organisational and individual performance management and accountability in the Garda.  The importance of having robust performance management systems in place has been emphasised in recent reports by Mr. Justice O'Higgins and the Garda Inspectorate.  A functioning performance framework will also be essential in overseeing the implementation of a wide range of third party reports, including those by Mr. Justice O'Higgins , the Garda Inspectorate, GSOC and so on.  This is not just a mechanical process with numbers and dates.  Victims' experiences, public confidence in and perception of Garda performance will be important measures.<\/p> <p>  On the code of ethics, during a recent consultation day event a number of people observed to me that the draft code we had published for public comment was 90% there, but there was, by no means, agreement on the same 90%.  However, since a code that satisfies everyone is probably not achievable, that was not too bad.  We will deliver a revised text soon, but the medium-term challenge we foresee, in which the committee might like to take an interest, will be embedding the code throughout the Garda organisation.  Much of this work will fall to the Garda Commissioner and her senior team, overseen by the authority, but I expect we will have suggestions to make to them.<\/p> <p>  The authority has certain functions in approving civilian posts and making senior civilian appointments which have recently taken effect.  We expect new regulations to commence our functions relating to senior Garda appointments shortly.  These tasks will present a logistical and resource challenge for us, but we regard them as contributing enormously to influencing the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Related to this, we have also been asked by the Minister to oversee the preparation by the Garda Commissioner of a workforce plan to deliver the Government&rsquo;s vision of a Garda service with 21,000 personnel, comprising garda&iacute;, civilians and reserves, including a plan to increase Garda visibility by redeploying more garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties and replacing them with civilians.  That is a task we have not yet commenced.<\/p> <p>  While I have referred to the challenges in what the authority has to do, we are always conscious that the challenge above everything else for all of us in this room is to have a police service that deserves and enjoys the trust and support of the people.  The Garda public attitude survey gives strong evidence of trust and community confidence in the Garda overall.  In that regard, Ireland is fortunate because law enforcement relies to a large measure on voluntary compliance and public confidence.  The authority considers that right now the combination of the recommendations for change provided in various reports, the capital envelope provided for investment in technology and equipment which is badly needed, the acceleration of recruitment and the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s personal commitment to modernisation and renewal provides a real opportunity for the Garda to professionalise, build and improve its capacity and provide a 21st century policing service.  By delivering on our mission \"to drive excellent policing through valued and effective oversight and governance\", the authority is determined to play its part in meeting that challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily and her colleagues for attending.

Members of the former Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality went to see how it was done in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

I note Ms Feehily's comments about doing an awful lot of work very quickly in terms of the establishment of the authority and I commend her on that.  <\/p><p> I have a number of observations on Ms Feehily's opening statement.  She indicated the policing plan has to be referred to the authority before the end of November.  How will that be managed?  How much influence will the Policing Authority have on the policing plan?  Can the authority say it is not happy with the policing plan and tell the Commissioner to go away and come back with a completely new one?  At which point does the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have autonomy?  Does the authority have complete control over the policing plan?  I am interested in that bit of information.  The move for absolute openness and transparency is extremely important.  We have seen too much secrecy in policing in this country over the years.  Ms Feehily's mission statement in terms of having transparency is important.  The political side and being here today is extremely important.  Ms Feehily said in her presentation she has had a meeting with the chairs of the joint policing committees, JPCs..  I would like to know a little bit more about that.  I am a member of a JPC and have been for a number of years.  They are a resource that is totally under-utilised.  There are some counties where the JPCs are very effective and other counties and councils where the JPC barely exists and has no real function.  What are Ms Feehily's observations on that?<\/p><p> The Policing Authority put its statement of strategy out for public consultation.  I am curious to know how many submissions there were.

The scheme for the policing plan set out in the Act envisages a linear process.  The Commissioner prepares the plan and it comes into us before November and we either approve it or do not approve it.  We decided it was not necessarily the most productive way to proceed.  The Commissioner and her team readily agreed that we would prepare it in a collaborative way.  We already have had a full-day workshop with the Commissioner's team to develop the plan together so that when it comes into us there should be minimal surprises and minimal disagreement on the content.  That is not to say that it will happen but that is how we want to work.  We want to work collaboratively.  It is the Commissioner's plan, the Commissioner sends it to us and the Act requires that we approve it.  By definition, we can decide not to approve it but it makes much more sense if we have had all of that discussion before the deadline.  That is how we are working it.  We will be considering the first text at a meeting of the authority tomorrow.  We will give some feedback to the Commissioner and there will be an opportunity for a more refined plan by the time of the deadline.  That is how we see that working.  The policing plan goes to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality for her consent and then it gets laid before the Houses as it always has done.  That is something the committee might want to think about in terms of suggestions as to how the committee will handle engagement with the policing plan in future.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with Senator Conway on the JPCs.  My sense of it has been that they are an under-utilised resource and that there is some patchiness.  Our function in JPCs is twofold.  One is to bring them together from time to time and the other is that we are responsible for providing guidance for JPCs.  In turn, JPCs are supposed to send us their annual reports and strategies.  Before we had the meeting I could have counted those reports on less than one hand.  Once we had the meeting, introduced ourselves and told them that we are here and have a function in the policing world we have started to receive more material from them.  I regard it as a very important constituency for us.  I did not want the first year to pass without at least bringing them together for conversation.  Some of them attended our public consultation day and we will build on that next year.  I am not quite sure yet how we will do that but our intention is to build on and deepen our engagement with the JPCs next year.  <\/p> <p>  The strategy statement was probably the least responded to of the various public consultations.  There were perhaps 15 or 20 responses.  However, the engagement with the code of ethics has been much more extensive.  We got quite a lot of submissions.  From memory, there were about 30 but as many of them were from groups, they represent a broader range of people.  Our public consultation day was over-subscribed.  We have statutory consultees we are obliged to consult so in order to make sure we had a balance in the room between the various actors, we had to limit some of the people.  We did not limit members of the public but we had to limit some of the people who wanted to attend.  If they wanted to send four or five people, we had to tell them they could only have one or two.  That was a very successful event in terms of engagement.  <\/p> <p>  The attendance at public meetings is modest but we are webcast.  One would expect it to be modest - people will not come into Dublin to go to public meetings in the middle of a working day when they can watch it on YouTube.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I have a brief supplementary question on JPC engagement.

One thing Ms Feehily has highlighted clearly is the authority's role in overseeing performance.  Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring was here last week and was very frank about the legislative shortcomings that stifled her organisation's ability to do its job properly in terms of dealing with complaints.  Has the Policing Authority noticed any legislative shortcomings in its task of overseeing performance, particularly from the point of view that it has to share the authority?  A really independent Policing Authority would be able to make the decisions for itself.  The way the legislation is framed means that a lot of the powers remain in the hands of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In that context, how much interaction has there been between the Policing Authority and the Minister since its establishment?  Have there been formal, face-to-face meetings?  Is there regular dialogue with departmental officials?  How much nitty-gritty has the Policing Authority got into in that regard?  It is particularly pertinent to deal with appointments and I will deal with that in a minute.  Overall, what level of engagement has gone on there?<\/p> <p>  In the public mind, the Policing Authority came onto the map around the time of the O'Higgins report with a very hard-hitting and frank statement about the holding of public hearings and the attempt to hold the Commissioner to account.  That is at the heart of what the public would see the Policing Authority's function to be.  Maybe in some ways the public meetings lacked teeth or a certain oomph.  I am not really sure why.  One gets the impression that, in part because of the way the Act is structured and because ultimately the authority does not really have the power to deal with the Commissioner, the establishment within the Garda authorities can come along and paint a merry story.  What checks are going on behind the scenes?  <\/p> <p>  I will deal with two issues in particular.  One is the treatment of whistleblowers and protected disclosures.  There is no doubt that the Policing Authority would not have been set up if it was not for whistleblowers, who were instrumental in shining a light on what was going on.  One of the first public hearings the Policing Authority had was on the new protected disclosure policy.<\/p><p>I attended the meeting at which the Commissioner lauded the new policy.  Every garda was going to get it.  A new liaison person was appointed and everything was going be absolutely great.  The Policing Authority issued a statement after that stating it would actively oversee the development of a safe environment in which people could report wrongdoing.<\/p><p> My knowledge of what has gone on inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the new policy indicates that it is still not a safe place for whistleblowers to make protected disclosures.  There are many shortcomings there.  Since that policy was aired in public in a practical sense, has Ms Feehily had much opportunity to engage directly with the Commissioner - not just at public meetings, but also non-public fora - at deputy commissioner, assistant commissioner or whatever other level that interaction takes place?  While I am not criticising it, I know there has been no engagement with the whistleblowers themselves.  I am sure the Policing Authority would not see that as its role.  How can very real shortcomings be brought to the authority's attention other than learning it from the hierarchy, which is its point of contact?  How does Ms Feehily see that?  If the Policing Authority is going to oversee performance, it must be able to oversee past that first layer and what level of engagement will have gone on.<\/p><p> My last point is the most important and relates to appointments.  The legislation gave the authority power and responsibility with regard to appointments.  We all know that a raft of senior Garda appointments were made without the authority's input at the year's inception, which makes a mockery of the Act in the first place, particularly when many people who were on promotions list are the very people against whom complaints have been made by whistleblowers.  We have this sort of ridiculous circle as a result of that.  Who gets promoted is critical in terms of transforming how a police service operates and the feeling of the public would be very much that the old boy network of people being appointed needs to be broken down.  This is one of the authority's key tasks, but it has not been allowed to do that.  Has it made representations to the Minister to try to stop that from happening?  I believe the authority should  be given that and the fact that it has not been enshrines a layer of Garda hierarchy over which it does not have any say or accountability which restricts the role somewhat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#K00600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I hope I have them in the right order.  The dialogue with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department is positive.  Literally in the past couple of days the chief executive and the Secretary General have signed a governance document setting out the relationship between the two of us.  We will place that on our website today or tomorrow.  It provides for formal liaison meetings at official level.  I have met the T&aacute;naiste on a few occasions - I am trying to count them now.  I am quite satisfied that I have an open door to the Department and the T&aacute;naiste if I want to raise something.  I am not conscious of any problem or constraint in that regard that I feel inhibits us.<\/p> <p>  The legislative scheme is the legislative scheme.  The Deputy mentioned its limitations.  I tend to see it in a positive way - kind of glass half full.  Many of the powers we have require the Minister's consent.  Consent is a quite a low bar.  It is not approval and it is kind of binary.  If the Minister does not consent, she can send it back.  In a transparent context I think those bars are fairly low.  We certainly have not found them to be a constraint.<\/p> <p>  The other thing in the Act that is very positive, and this addresses the Deputy's first question, is that, unusually, it requires us to make a report to the Minister after two years about any constraints we have or functions or powers we do not have.  Most Acts struggle to get themselves reviewed.  In this one we are obliged to report if our powers are strong enough and whether our functions are working.  We do not have a choice and we will have to do that by the end of next year.  I have given my authority colleagues a direct instruction that they are to keep a jotter.  I do not want to start next year trying to work out what we think we need to know.  We should be gathering it as we go along.<\/p> <p>  We have already noted one or two edges on the appointments piece that need a bit of refining.  Other than that we have not yet come up against anything that we regard as a problem.  I have no doubt that by next year we will have a substantial submission to make to the T&aacute;naiste as we proceed through our work programme.  I look forward to that and I see that in a positive way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that our public meetings lacked teeth.  I suppose this in a way comes back to my remarks about a performance framework.  To be fair to the Garda, the legislative scheme always expected a policing plan with performance targets.  There never was one.  There was never anybody asking how many, how much and what it cost.  It just did not happen.  A more rigorous set of conversations are needed first of all to build a framework.  We would like to be getting a monthly report, as the Northern Ireland Policing Board does - a short report, not a tome - from the Commissioner covering performance against targets and what has been happening in policing in the previous weeks.  The PSNI Chief Constable does this every month and he publishes it.  We are working to have that as a basis.<\/p> <p>  It is much easier to have teeth in a public meeting when one has a bit of paper against which one can measure.  We have to create all that infrastructure first.  We are also all learning about how to behave in public.  Not all authority members may be as comfortable as Deputies and Senators are at asking questions in a public forum.  It is a different kind of oversight from what exists in most other parts of the public sector.  I would say it is a work in progress.<\/p> <p>  I also think we made the mistake in our public meetings of overloading our agendas and we are about to do it again this week, because there is just so much that people want to ask.  As a result, coverage versus depth becomes a problem for us.  We are very conscious of that.<\/p> <p>  We have private meetings with the Commissioner and we have a committee system through which there is engagement with the senior team in the Garda.  That forms part of the checks and balance the Deputy asked about.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whistleblowers, rightly or wrongly the authority will claim some credit for getting the policy published because we called for it to be published.  We are now in the middle of a formal review of that policy to be completed in the next few weeks.  This was at the request of the T&aacute;naiste, but we were doing it anyway for ourselves.<\/p> <p>  The dilemma on the day of the public meeting, which the Deputy described, was that we got the policy about two hours before the meeting.  That did not make it easy to ask the kinds of rigorous questions the Deputy might have expected and we might have asked.  We are carrying out a review and we are getting input from a few experts.  In a matter of weeks we will produce a draft report on that policy.  There is no point in challenging the operation of a policy if the policy itself is not best in class.  We will send that to the Commissioner for her observations and we will then publish it.  In a couple of weeks we will have a review of the protected disclosures policy to make available.<\/p> <p>  In response to how we learn about shortcomings, the Deputy would be surprised at how many people write to us.  We get letters from victims, civil society groups and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Information comes to our attention in a variety of ways.  We are deepening our engagement not just with joint policing committees, JPCs.  Some of the staff of the authority will begin to attend local policing forums accordingly as we have staff to spare.  We are very conscious of the need to broaden our sources of input so that it is not bilateral.  The Deputy is absolutely right about that.  The members of the authority also have deep networks and bring a range of experience.  Everybody has some basis for engaging, measuring and understanding how policing works.  The members of the authority also have their own networks.  We have many inputs and we turn those inputs into themes.<\/p> <p>  We have a notion for next year, and I ask the committee not to hold me to this if it does not happen immediately.  We are thinking of trying to evolve the public meetings into themed meetings where some of the inputs would inform how we would set out our work programme for the year.  However, we have not got there yet.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that we are also disappointed about appointments.<\/p><p>That would not be a surprise to the Department, the T&aacute;naiste or the Commissioner.  Deputy Daly asked whether we had objected.  I will put it the other way around in a positive way, if the Deputy does not mind.  At our first meeting, we identified the commencement of the appointments sections as a key piece in terms of that cultural change.  We wrote to the Department to that effect.  We subsequently had some minuted engagement with officials from the Department about the timing.  We gave it contributions on what we might see in the regulations.  We have been very active in terms of being ready.  At the same time, I have to say that there came a point in the year when the Commissioner's capacity in terms of her senior team was seriously diminished due to retirements and so on.  We cannot expect an excellent service from a policing service that simply does not have people in post.  There is always a dilemma there.  It was not our dilemma, rather it was one between the Commissioner and the Department.  I wish to say that we share the committee's interest in commencing those sections and we are ready to begin to hold appointment competitions for the senior ranks as soon as those regulations are made.  We also have a function, as I mentioned, in regard to civilians, which has been commenced.  We are waiting on submissions from the Commissioner on senior civilian appointments because we already have that function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for her presentation.  I am conscious of the fact that the Policing Authority is at its infancy stage and I would be the first to admit that I feel that it does not have as much power as it should have.  I argued very strongly for as much in the Chamber when the legislation was going through the House.<\/p> <p>  In the witness's statement of strategy, she pointed out that she is keeping on a review the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of its functions, the arrangements and strategies in place to support and enhance the performance of these functions and the mechanisms in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the measurement of performance and accountability of members and staff.  The witness will be familiar with the fact that the O'Higgins report raised serious concerns about the role of the Garda Commissioner in efforts to undermine the credibility of whistleblower Maurice McCabe.  It is clear from the report that if Maurice McCabe had not taped the meeting in Mullingar, he would probably have been thrown under the bus.  How much has the Policing Authority progressed in addressing that concern?  I wonder if it has the teeth to hold the Commissioner to account.<\/p> <p>  The witness made the point that the Policing Authority has access to the Minister and it is an open door.  I believe that emphasises the point that the authority is a preacher of the Minister.  I see it as being unfortunate that the authority is not a more independent body as well as being independent of the Commissioner.  Does the witness agree with that?<\/p> <p>  To return to the Garda inspectorate report, I am very aware of the fact that the Policing Authority has too much on its plate.  I do not know how well-resourced it is to deal with the challenges that face it.  The Garda Commissioner committed to implementing the broad principals that were contained in that Garda inspectorate report but not to the 200 recommendations.  Where does that sit?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly touched on the issue of promotions, which is a huge problem and challenge to get right.  We have had a lot of contact with members of the force in the last few years.  One of the most striking things that has come our way is the fact that so many good garda&iacute; struggle to rise up the ladder.  We are equally shocked by the number of garda&iacute; who have reached the high table who have been engaged in poor practice at different stages along the way.  We are aware at the moment of some members who are on the promotion list.  There is a person at No. 14 who I will not name who is actually under investigation.  It beggars belief from our point of view.  I do not see how things are going to change if we are going to see this being tolerated.  How much of a handle is the Policing Authority going to be able to get in this area?  How much is the authority going to be able to hold the Commissioner to account in terms of who she does and does not promote?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#M00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>That is enough to be going on with.  The Deputy made a remark about resources.  I do not want the committee to think that I am whingeing.  We have a decent budget and our own Vote.  We just have not had the time to do the recruiting.  I am not whingeing about our budget.  That might be unusual for a public sector body, but we have a decent budget for this year and are in the middle of negotiating next year's budget.  It is simply a question of getting up and running, building systems and recruiting people.  If we stopped to do that, we would not get all of the other jobs done.<\/p> <p>  The performance that I refer to is broad.  There is the performance of the organisation.  There are various ways and dimensions through which we are looking at that.  One of them is the inspectorate report and I will return to that.  There was also a commitment about individual performance management, which was very clear in the O'Higgins report.  That has not been implemented in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have a function to oversee that.  That is what we were talking about in our strategy statement.  Over the next three years, we will want to see the deepening of performance beyond a headline set of figures towards a deepening at regional and divisional level down to the individual performance that the O'Higgins report referred to and that the Commissioner intends to implement.  We need to understand how deep that is going to be and then oversee the implementation of it.  That is not without its tensions for the Commissioner.  I am aware of that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the most recent inspectorate report entitled Changing Policing in Ireland, the Commissioner has committed to accepting, or accepting with modifications, about 90% of those recommendations.  We will produce a piece of work next year and beyond.  We will produce quarterly reports on that commitment and we will be sending them to the T&aacute;naiste.  The T&aacute;naiste has asked us to do this.  We would have done it in any event but might not have sent them to her.  We regard this as a very important piece of our work.  In a way, that is why I referred to it in the opening statement.<\/p> <p>  One of the criticisms one hears of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na down the years that I think is reasonable to put on the table is the failure to implement recommendations in other reports, whether it was commissions of inquiry, GSOC inspectorates or even the one from a group chaired by then Senator Maurice Hayes rather a long time ago that has still not been implemented.  We are determined to take the most recent one and build a structure in which we will assess quarterly the implementation of those 90% of recommendations that the Commissioner has accepted.  I believe Deputy Wallace is right to emphasise that and we are emphasising it as well.  It is going to be one of our measures of performance.<\/p> <p>  There are two dimensions to the promotions.  There is the issues of the senior ranks, which I have discussed with Deputy Daly, around which the amount of power the authority has and what we will be able to do depends on the regulations.  We have made our submission.  We want the regulations to be as facilitating as possible to allow us to have best practice around recruitment.  That will probably mean the kinds of practices that might be a bit new the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but would not be new in the context of the Civil Service and the public sector.  I am concerned here about having different approaches that are already in use.  It is unusual to me to find appointment processes being so specifically regulated in a statutory instrument.  Most public bodies have a framework to do with ethics and merit.<\/p><p>However, things like one's practices, the toolkit or how many will be on an interview board all evolve with HR experience.  This is a little bit different so we want the regulations to give us as much scope as possible to evolve the processes for the selection of the senior ranks.  We also have a function to keep under review general recruitment and appointments below that level and we will follow up on a third-party report produced by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in its capacity as auditor of the appointments made by the Commissioner, namely, those to sergeant and inspector.  The commission has published a report with a set of recommendations and we intend to follow up on those as well.  We are keen not to duplicate work if another body has done an audit and made findings.  We will see what is going to happen with those before we turn over any new stones.<\/p><p> The last comment related to the Commissioner.  The oversight accountability framework in the statute is complex but the Commissioner's personal accountability is to the T&aacute;naiste.  Our role is about the organisation, the services, the systems and the processes and we are mindful of that.  That is not to say we have any reason to complain about the Commissioner.  I do not wish this to be misunderstood.  I am just trying to answer the Deputy's question directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Is Ms Feehily saying that if she looks at the O'Higgins report, no matter how damning she may or may not find it, it is outside her remit to address any difficulties it throws up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#N00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>If it throws up issues and difficulties that are to do with the organisation, its performance, the systems, the processes or the procedures we can address all of those but the Deputy asked about the Commissioner's personal-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Is the Commissioner's performance, as outlined in the O'Higgins report, outside Ms Feehily's remit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#N00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The O'Higgins report outlined the performance of the Commissioner as a body corporate.

In contrast to ten years ago, there are a lot of statutory bodies involved in supervising garda&iacute;, namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority.  We also frequently have commissions of investigation, which have to be considered seriously, and reports under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  In my view, of all the authorities I have mentioned the Policing Authority has the most potential and its statutory authority could become very powerful if developed in the right way.  This would be to the benefit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to the O'Higgins report, the main message of which was the significant absence of management and supervision within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What can Ms Feehily do to try to improve management and supervision?  <\/p> <p>  The power of the authority will be envied for the moulding role it can play in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the power of recruitment, which it will get in due course.  Is it the intention of the authority to hold competitions for recruitment to positions such as superintendent?  Is it Ms Feehily's ambition to seek to offer those positions to people who are not within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I refer to police officers in different jurisdictions or graduates who might have a useful role to play.

This is where performance management comes in; if nobody asks a sergeant, an inspector or a supervisor about their performance, the consequence is we are going to end up with very patchy performance.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the absence of good technology and there is not a good IT-based incident management which can monitor who picked up the file, metaphorically speaking, what they did with it, when they did it, the time lapses or details of when a file was dropped or not pursued.  From the point of view of supervision, there is not an easy way to access those data and that was a surprise to me, given where I came from, where we used technology to monitor how cases moved along.  Performance encompasses supervision and we can make that a centrepiece of our examination of the Commissioner.  I have advised the Commissioner's team that it needs to build measures into its incident management system so that we can ask the questions about time lapses, throughput and such things.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about moulding and that is hugely important..  The code of ethics also has a part to play in this area and next year we will set aside time to look under the bonnet of the training programme to see where we can influence it in respect of service and victims.  We will look toward the formation of garda&iacute; in the context of policing principles, which are a powerful element of the Act.<\/p> <p>  Our ambition, as opposed to what is likely to happen in respect of appointments, may require two answers.  The ambition of my authority colleagues, which we have communicated to the Department, would be for open recruitment to be moved downward.  The Government took a decision to have open recruitment for the top two levels and we would like to bring it down to the next level.  This is not reinventing the wheel as it is common in other parts of the public sector.  Open recruitment has moved gradually downward and recruitment is now open at all levels.  That is our ambition but I am not sure whether the regulations will allow that, at least initially.  If they do not, it will be on the list we will prepare by the end of next year, and which I discussed with Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly.  The Garda Inspectorate has been asked to look at best practice internationally in respect of opening up recruitment at all levels.  I am very encouraged by that and the authority will make a submission to that project.<\/p> <p>  If recruitment cannot be opened to the public we are at least keen for it to be open at a number of levels, as happens in other sectors, so that ambitious newly-recruited junior garda&iacute; do not have to go through being a sergeant to be an inspector.

As mentioned previously, public confidence, transparency and oversight are key to what the authority is trying to achieve in the context of the process of reform within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I was slightly alarmed when Ms Feehily mentioned collaborative co-operation around the policing plan.  I would like her to detail what that involves.  As a statutory authority of governance and oversight, how has she ensured that the authority has a process of governance and independence?  If the authority is engaging and co-operating at that level, how can it properly, review, monitor and provide that system of oversight for its policing plan?  Is there a conflict at an organisational and governance level?  What is the authority doing to ensure that does not occur or that issues around that do not occur in terms of public confidence in that critical engagement?  Ms Feehily might respond to those questions.<\/p> <p>  I raised a question with Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring when she appeared before the committee last week about the annual report of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which contains 36 recommendations on systemic and management issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the vast majority of cases some were not responded to at all and some were forwarded or acknowledged but there was no detailed response or feedback around the actions taken on foot of that.  Ms Feehily mentioned the follow-through aspect. Has she engaged with Garda senior management and the Commissioner to ensure that happens in terms of what GSOC has advocated.  What emerged from what we heard last week is that it finds itself constrained by the legislation and by its lack of empowerment in terms of implementation.  The authority's role in that respect is important.  <\/p> <p>  In the context of the authority's strategy, Ms Feehily mentioned a community-focused approach and performance indicators around that.  I have seen the haemorrhaging of garda&iacute; in community policing locally, and I am sure the authority's engagements with the joint policing committees have illustrated that.  That needs to be actively addressed.   Also, some counties have no drug units.  We have seen an increase in drug-related crime recently.  The issue of certain counties not having drug units needs to be addressed at a policing level, as there is a vacuum there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#O00400","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I would very much endorse the Deputy's last point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#O00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The Chairman has seen that in his constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#O00600","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I have that problem in my constituency.

We had a choice.  One could argue that by being the approving body, the act of approving has the same risk.  We could get a plan and say that it is good, but the risk applies in any event.  Our dilemma was do we allow the Garda to produce a policing plan without any input and then respond by saying we do not like it, send it back with that process taking months.  We chose, based on our assessment of last year's plan and on deficiencies we would have seen in terms of measures, to help the Garda to design a plan that might be able to get itself approved by the authority more quickly.  I take Deputy Chamber's point and we are careful about it. <\/p> <p>  We have also done other work, which we want to deepen in future years but there was not the time to do that this year.  One of our functions is to establish policing priorities.  We would like greater public consultation on that in future years.  This year we outlined them at the meeting I held with the JPCs and we got input from the chairs of JPCs, and on our consultation day we got input from civil society groups.  We put forward a set of policing priorities that seemed to us to be reasonable.  We set out why we chose them and we got input from those two groups.  Next year when we will work on a code of ethics, we will engage in deeper public consultation.  In a way that keeps us from being captured.  We have to consult the Commissioner as well about the priorities but we have to set them.  It is a matter of striking a balance.  We are very mindful of the point the Deputy made.<\/p> <p>  On the GSOC report and follow-through on that, one of the items we asked the Commissioner to include in the policing plan for next year, and always, is to advance the recommendations of what we are calling third party reports because the list is rather long.  I expect when the Commissioner meets the committee she will identify something of the order of 1,000 recommendations that she is attempting to implement and which have been clustered together into the modernisation plan for advancement.  We will certainly be pressing the Commissioner to follow through on recommendations but I have to be honest and say that if we took deal with every one of those 1,000 recommendations we would do nothing else.  We want to follow through on the reports from the Garda Inspectorate and GSOC that came out in 2015 and 2016, including one that came out in the past few weeks which contains specific system recommendations, rather than to allow ourselves get bogged down in a morass of dealing with a 1,000 recommendations.<\/p> <p>  If we can get this framework going with the Garda where we can have a tracking system for recommendations that are current, at least we might stay on top of them.  I would like if we could address the other aspects but being honest we have to work on the current ones and see how we get on because the bucket is going to continue to fill.  There are other parts of the system making recommendations.  The Inspectorate has new work to do.  GSOC will have another annual report and so on.  We are going to try to keep it current.  The Deputy is right in identifying us, we are the follow-through element.  That is our job.  We have put it explicitly in our strategy.  We put it explicitly in the Garda Commissioner's strategy before we approved it that we expect to see follow-through on third party reports.<\/p> <p>  On the unevenness of deployment, I mentioned in my opening statement that this is one of the places we have to go - the connection between resourcing and deployment.  It is not a piece of work we have done yet.  I have to be honest with the committee on that.  I see a huge opportunity in the programme for Government commitment to increase numbers in order to for us to get under the bonnet of that issue.  The Commissioner has been asked by the T&aacute;naiste to develop a workforce plan in conjunction with the authority.  I see this as the way into that.  Some of the answer to the visibility question and the community policing question is about recruiting civilians.  The Inspectorate has put that out in lights.  It is about replacing trained, sworn garda&iacute; with civilians where that makes sense in order to make sure that there is a higher proportion of the fully trained garda&iacute; available for duties, whether it relates to drugs crime, community policing and so on.<\/p> <p>  At our first public meeting we explored the community policing element with Deputy Commissioner John Twomey and he committed to an evaluation of where they stand on community policing and I understand that evaluation is now commencing.  When we have a meeting and the Garda group team commit to doing something, we follow up on that.  We have followed up on that commitment and they have told us that it is now beginning in a few regions and they will grow it from there.  The Deputy can take it that we will be keeping on their case about the evaluation of community policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Feehily.

The establishment of the authority is very welcome, as is the attendance of the witnesses here today.  We are now nearly at a point where we as a committee should be considering a six-montly type process where we would get an update and have this type of exchange to track back on many of the issues that Ms Feehily has highlighted today.<\/p><p>As so much of the authority's work is at commencement stage, it is very difficult for members to form any real judgment on it at this point without being unfair to the witnesses.<\/p><p> There is no question but that over time the Policing Authority will become one of the powerful parts of the entire system.  That will rankle people in other areas because the authority creating that space for itself will mean that others will have to give in some way.  I hope the witnesses are successful and that the Policing Authority comes to play a meaningful role.  I wish them all the best in that regard.<\/p><p> I want to pick up on one or two issues.  I am sorry to be direct but on a point made already, and I listened to the reply, I do not believe it is right that the authority engaged in the process mentioned with the Garda Commissioner to devise the plan.  To be clear about where I am coming from, the authority's mission statement refers to the purpose of overseeing the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its functions with regard to policing services.  If, at a point in the future, an issue comes under investigation or challenge, it cannot be best practice for people within Garda management to be able to say that, for example, they held a one-day work session and that issue originated with the Policing Authority.  That would present a major conflict.  The witnesses might say that is splitting hairs but it would present a very different and much more problematic conflict in terms of an authority endorsing and signing off on a plan.  Even though it would mean that the process of approval will be elongated in the future, I ask the witnesses to reconsider that in terms of their practice in future years.<\/p><p> My next point is on how one views the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a force.  It is not equivalent to other State services in terms of people applying at different levels and this goes to the recruitment issue.  In a service with ranks and a command structure and where, because of the nature of the work involved, there is a necessity to maintain a command structure, I seriously question the notion of people being able to jump quantum levels, so to speak, within that structure.  For example, somebody at a rank in the command structure one day could jump multiple levels above the person who previously had been a rank above them in that structure.  That might be a new structure for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which the authority might examine in the future, but in terms of some of the functions the garda&iacute; have to perform in their role, which is very different to a person coming in to an administrative type job, there are many benefits arising out of the existing command structure in terms of force discipline.  The State cannot have it both ways.  If we want to recognise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as separate and stand alone, with the restrictions that apply to it, as highlighted by the Garda Representative Association, GRA, over the years, we cannot mess around with that in the way the witnesses outlined, which would mean we would have an appointments process that would undermine a command structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#O01000","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I would make two points.  The Deputy said the process was a little early but it is also an opportunity.  We are at a formation stage.  The Chairman indicated that the committee plans to produce a report and recommendations, so suggestions are welcome.  Like the previous committee to which Senator Conway referred, we also visited Northern Ireland and Scotland.  There are nuanced differences both in the legal and governance infrastructures.  We are all different and we have things to learn from each other.  That is why I was grateful to get in early in the committee's work programme.  There are advantages in us having an opportunity to hear the members' views also as we evolve our work methods.<\/p> <p>  All I can say on the collaboration question is that I hear the Deputy.  I assure him we are extraordinarily mindful of the risk of regulatory capture.  We made a judgment.  It may not be necessary to have a collaborative process every year.  This is something for which we needed to get a better plan.  In the literature about policing oversight, the phrase used is \"critical friend\".  There is an element, and we have a statutory role also, of supporting policing and supporting the garda&iacute;.  Creating a dynamic that is always a case of \"you do it and we will knock it\" is not necessarily the best form for a fledgling oversight body.  We judged that to get this performance framework established better, we should give them a better understanding of the kind of plan we would want before us for approval.  <\/p> <p>  I must take slight issue with the Deputy on another matter.  He probably did not mean it but I would not want it to be left hanging.  If, in future, somebody can say that the genesis of an idea came from the Policing Authority, that is almost inevitable because everything will not be in the policing plan.  For example, as I mentioned to Deputy Daly, we will be completing a review shortly of the protected disclosures policy and we will say that \"X\" might be considered.  We will always be contributing ideas and recommendations and if one of them turns out not to be adequate, we have to be held to account but I do not believe we will ever not be contributing ideas.  We would not be doing the full scope in terms of the critical friend but also the power of oversight, and Deputy O'Callaghan spoke about our contribution to formation, moulding and assisting the force, unless we are putting ideas before Garda management and the Department.  In case that comment was left hanging, I want to make clear that there will always be ideas.  In five years' time, someone will say he or she would not have done something only for the authority.  That is life.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about my remarks on recruitment and command structure.  Most public bodies are bureaucracies.  They have a degree of command structure and grading systems.  If we, as a nation, want to have an opportunity to influence the culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as called for in many reports, not just commissions of investigation but the inspectorate report and so on, one way of influencing culture, which is what I believe was Deputy O'Callaghan's point, is to let in fresh thinking.  If the only way in the door is Templemore, and the only way up is step by step, that creates a cultural restriction.  That is why we believe the inspectorate examining the other ways in is a positive move.  It is not unusual in other police services.  For example, in other police services a basic grade police officer could apply by way of an open competition and become superintendent.  That is not unheard of, and it is not unheard of to move around police services and bring a richness of ideas.  We have to be open.  I am not sure that even if we go this route, or if the regulations allow us to go this route, the result might not necessarily be that the experience people gain at each level will make them fit to be the most likely promotees.  Opening up the process addresses an ambition piece that we need to look after in terms of junior people and an opportunity for ideas to allow people move quicker through the organisation.  The extent to which the ambitions I outlined will come to pass will depend on regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#Q00100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I wish to add one quick point.

I am not quite sure whether that invitation came from us or from her, but it was a positive engagement between the T&aacute;naiste and all of the authority members, not only with myself.<\/p> <p>  On the final part of the Deputy's question, nothing on which we have asked consent has been refused.  Conversely, and I have a list here somewhere, the T&aacute;naiste has asked us to do a number of things that she can formally refer to us under the Act.  She formally referred the O'Higgins report to us in our oversight capacity.  She formally asked us to examine the policies on whistleblowers.  She formally asked us to oversee a review by the Garda Inspectorate - this goes to some of the earlier discussion - of the boundaries of Garda districts, the distribution of garda&iacute;, deployment and rostering.  That is a long piece of work that has been formally referred to us.  We have been requested formally to report periodically on Changing Policing in Ireland to give our assessment of implementation, and we have been asked, as I mentioned earlier, in conjunction with the Commissioner, to develop a five-year plan for achieving the vision of the 21,000 people involved, comprising civilians, the reserve and garda&iacute;.  Therefore, we have had five formal referrals under the Act from the T&aacute;naiste, all of which is adding to that list of priorities I mentioned, and we have sent a number of statutory documents - our strategy and the Commissioner's strategy - to the T&aacute;naiste for her consent and we have not run into any difficulties in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>On my own behalf, I have a couple of points before closing.

We will deal with that in private session in a few moments.<\/p><p>On the expected new regulations on commencing her functions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the appointment of senior Garda positions, Ms Feehily used the word &quot;shortly&quot; in her earlier response.  Could she translate that into any timeframe or is it likely in the remaining period to the end of the year?<\/p><p>I have a couple of questions and I will bundle them for Ms Feehily, if I may.  In terms of her remarks and looking at the strategy, while I understand and accept that every day in life is a new and learning experience and we are always building on what we have done before, is there a bedding-down period?  Is there a reasonable expectation of when the new Policing Authority will be functioning at its zenith?  Ms Feehily might give us a sense of it.<\/p><p>I commend the use of the word &quot;service&quot; in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing.

It is important that it does.<\/p><p>How regularly does the authority meet?  Ms Feehily is talking about creating the means of measuring, and I note that throughout.  Setting targets and the authority having a methodology to measure progress comes across as how it goes about that, but are there other, preferably better, means of measuring progress?  There may be others but if they are not better, they are of no use.  Has Ms Feehily considered any other methodology of measuring progress in terms of her objectives other than mere target-driven methodology?<\/p><p>Ms Feehily spoke about plentiful correspondence, which is good for a relatively new organisation.

From the authority's point of view, we will be producing our first annual report by Easter next.  We will be reporting a body of work at that point and I would hope that we would be able to state that certain of our functions are established and up and running.  The appointments piece may well continue to be a work in progress because it is commencing so late, and the fact that in the course of next year we will be developing a report on the shortcomings in our legislative framework probably makes it difficult to say whether we will ever bed down.  I am certainly happy that elements, such as having a proper tracking system in place, better public meetings, better public engagement and a published code of ethics, will have been established as part of our infrastructure and be functioning better than they are this year by the time we make our first annual report.  I would be happy to come in then and talk to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Picking up Deputy Brophy's point about regular reporting, maybe when we produce our annual report we can then say what bits are embedded and what parts of our functions we have not even begun.  We have a long list of functions, for example, to keep under review the governance, training, recruitment, etc.  Some of those pieces will be one-off tasks that we will get to incrementally.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked how often the authority meets.  The authority meets as an authority in plenary.  We started out thinking we would meet 11 times - that would be once a month, except August.  As it happens, this year we will probably have met 13 times, including one or two that have been done by electronic means.  At all of the 11 plenary meetings this year, we will meet the Commissioner.  I am sorry I did not answer that question from Deputy Clare Daly.  We meet the Commissioner at every one of our monthly meetings.  Four or five of them are in public.  This year, it is five.<\/p> <p>  We also have a committee system.  Authority members have formed three committees.  We have four, but three are for engaging with the Garda.  These are performance and strategy, code of ethics and appointments.  Those committees would meet Garda colleagues and Garda representatives as often as necessary.  The performance and strategy committee meets at least once a month.  The code of ethics committee meets frequently, but less frequently with the Garda.  The appointments committee is a work in progress because we are not doing the appointments.  Between the whole lot, we will certainly meet them.  The chief executive and her team meet a liaison team at least twice a month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>At least, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>There is a lot of engagement.  The Chairman asked about targets.<\/p><p>I will ask Ms Hall to give an example that might crystallise the difference between the policing plan of last year and the one we foresee.  That might give members a sense of what we are using as targets because they are not all hard numbers.  We are also hoping to identify in the plan how the targets will be measured.<\/p><p> To get back to the question, some of the measures are numbers.  Some will come from better technology that will enable us to interrogate efficiency.  However, one of the biggest measures is a public attitude survey the Garda has carried out and published.  It contains a very rich body of information and was independently conducted.  We made a proposal recently that we might joint-fund that piece of work because we want to broaden and deepen it.  We do not see value in two separate agencies asking the public asking what it thinks of the performance.  Properly carried out public attitude surveys such as the current one demonstrate a high level of public trust in the abstract and also public confidence in the Garda.  However, since the sample size may not be as good as it should be, the granularity evident at the level of victims may not be rich enough to give us the answers.  Therefore, we would like to have more input from victims' and community groups through a deeper survey system.  It is absolutely correct to state measures are not all hard numbers.<\/p><p> On the final question about awareness, the first thing we had to do was draft a leaflet setting out what we, GSOC does and the Garda Inspectorate did.  This is because so much of our correspondence is misdirected.  To the extent that there is strong awareness, it tends to be among groups of people who already have a strong awareness of the policing realm and, perhaps, people who are coming to us after having already engaged with other parts of it.  Sometimes, other than saying this will inform our development of thematic oversight, we do not have a function that can help them.  On an individual basis, it largely rests with GSOC.  The Chairman was correct in that regard.  It is partly what I meant when I talked in my opening remarks about the authority becoming established in the public mind.<\/p><p> I was asked about making space for us and relationships.  I described it last year as having to elbow our way into the relationships that had been established for over 100 years and that had their own language, working norms and understandings.

In last year's policing plan the objective in the Garda Commissioner's plan was to make victims central to the service provided.  One of the measures required a consistent and professional service to be provided for all victims of crime and reduced re-victimisation.  We were trying to get something that would be more measurable into this year's plan.  This year, therefore, the action is to provide a professional service, but we are looking for very specific targets.  Targets represent the place to start.  In future years we will be examining proxies for performance and enhancing it in a qualitative way.  An example we hope to see in the 2017 plan is a measure stipulating that for a minimum of X percentage of incidents an investigating officer must be assigned.  The percentages will be filled in later.  A minimum of X per cent of investigation deadlines are to met.  The level of victim satisfaction is to be increased and maintained at a minimum of 60% in the public attitude survey.  There are references to improved detection rates in key areas such as assaults, including sexual assaults.  As one can see, it is much more specific.

They are not members of the authority.  One of the jobs I have asked them to do involves taking a good look at our governance, reviewing our performance and devising a methodology to review it.  When I use the words \"the authority\", I mean the authority members, the nine of us.  It is our job to review the performance of Ms Hall and her team.<\/p> <p>  I will certainly feed into the work the comments made today.  It is a matter of which we are mindful.  We documented very early on the governance structures and the division of functions.  We are drafting a relationship agreement with the Garda that will tease out some of these issues further.  We have our own governance framework.  We have just published a relationship agreement with the Department of Justice and Equality and will produce one between us and the Garda in order to underline the need to be as helpful as we can.  We have a shared objective.  All actors in the space - GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority, the Garda Commissioner and the Minister - have a shared ambition, namely, for there to be an excellent policing service.  There is no question about this and it is important that we do not lose sight of it while we are all dividing ourselves into our silos.<\/p> <p>  For the information of the Chairman, the word \"service\" has actually been contained in the Act since 2005, but it is really difficult to get it into the vernacular.  If I slip occasionally, I apologise, but I do try to use the word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Ms Feehily has done so today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#R00800","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475049600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I do try to use it all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016092800002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1475049600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Full marks - ten out of ten.

I am delighted to be here on behalf of the Irish Film Board.  We sent the committee copies of our strategic plan and catalogue for 2016.  I will address my vision for and outline my credentials as chairperson designate of the Irish Film Board.  I have been acting chairperson since June 2015, following the passing of Bill O'Herlihy, prior to which I was a board member for two years.  The current board will finish its term in 2017.  Therefore, I will be chairperson for a short period.<br\/><br\/>I am president of the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, a higher education institute specialising in the creative and cultural industries, and have a background in film and the cultural sector.  The IADT includes the national film school and associated programmes.<br\/><br\/>I have extensive board experience.  I was a board member of the National Digital Research Council, Institutes of Technology Ireland and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Adult Education Board.  I was secretary of my daughter's PTA for three years.  Those members who have been involved with PTAs will understand the experience one gains in that regard.  Therefore, I bring to the board extensive experience in the creative and cultural sector.  I also bring a particular focus on diversity and gender equality, something the board was interested in pursuing and which has been a particular passion of mine.<br\/><br\/>It is an incredibly exciting and prosperous time for Irish film.  The committee will have seen our film catalogue for 2016.  The Oscar nominations received in 2015 and the awards we received, nationally and internationally, were tremendous, not only in terms of the economic benefits to Ireland from the Irish film industry but also in terms of the social and cultural benefits and Ireland's reputation abroad as a nation of great storytellers and film makers.  I am excited to be part of a film industry that is so interesting and thriving.  In 2015-16 Irish films took in over $147 million at the worldwide box office and already this year the new crop of Irish films, including &quot;The Young Offenders&quot; which is set in Cork, &quot;A Date for Mad Mary&quot; which is set in Drogheda and &quot;The Siege of Jadotville&quot;, are doing incredibly well at the box office.  As chairperson, I look forward to seeing successes equal to those in 2015 and I hope international awards and accolades in 2016.  This achievement is the result of continued investment by successive Governments and the Department in film and the arts.  We note that Culture 2025 is up for discussion.  We have representatives involved in that discussion.  As a film board, we are delighted to see the arts and culture being given such a central position in the programme for Government, which is welcome.  Continued investment is important, not only to produce home-grown talent, but also to extend film-making and film studios into the regions.  <br\/><br\/>We continue to support festivals.  We support the Dingle and Dublin animation festivals, the Galway Film Fleadh and the Cork Film Festival.  It is important to me, as chairpersons, that film-making is not Dublin centric but is enjoyed and has economic benefits in the regions.  Section 5 of our document is entitled, <i>carpe diem<\/i>- seize the day - because what we need to do now is capitalise on that success.  What I have done with the board in the development of our new strategy is outline in section 6 a number of things that are important to our continued success.  They include the economic benefits, including the growing number of jobs and the new film studios in Limerick; the importance of training and education which, obviously, sit well with my background in higher education; and building audiences, both in Ireland and internationally.  Earlier this year we were in Cannes where it was delightful to be approached by people from so many countries looking to participate in co-productions with us.<br\/><br\/>I must mention &quot;Star Wars&quot; which has been important in highlighting the fantastic landscape and locations available in Ireland for film companies.  We want to increase inward investment and productions.  We like participating in co-productions, not only with UK companies.  We have also worked with Canadian companies.  We work with companies in countries all across the world and want to continue doing so.<br\/><br\/>In terms of training and further education, my institution includes the national film school, but, clearly, there is a real need to develop the film-making talent of the future across the industry, not only actors but also those who work in front of and behind the camera.  It is good that Screen Training Ireland has become part of the Irish Film Board while I have been chairperson in order that there is a coherent approach to training.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on the issue of funding.<\/p><p>It requires long-term investment to produce a movie and to develop the talent.  Lenny Abrahamson is a good example of that.  He has been supported from very early days from his earliest films such as \"Adam and Paul\" through to his internationally acclaimed success with \"Room\" but we require that continued investment and confidence in the film industry.  We are looking to the Department and the Government to continue that support.  We are delighted to see such a good reference in the programme for Government.  We are developing animation and film - all of the things I have spoken about - and I hope the committee has taken the time to read our statement.  I again thank the committee for allowing me as chair designate to address it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Annie Doona","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>That was very interesting.

I hope that after this short reprise today, I can give the committee some sense of why it is fundamentally important.<\/p> <p>  My motivation for seeking an appointment in the first instance arose not just recently but from a very firm belief in the importance of music throughout all the stages of people's lives.  If I can give further commitment, devotion and passion to that, this would be very significant.  In respect of governance, which I know is part of the essential requirement, I have extensive board governance experience across all sectors and have had quite a few involvements in school, sport and culture-related situations as well as more local situations.  More particularly, I served on the outgoing board for its final 18 months in the lead up to the legislation, which gave me a deep understanding of the challenges.  However, it did not quench my appetite in terms of wanting to come forward.  I think all members of the committee know that the National Concert Hall occupies a unique place in the cultural landscape, not just of Dublin, but of the entire country.  We want to expand and develop this further and make everybody proud of such an important and iconic venue.  <\/p> <p>  I know some people are always interested in details and, naturally, today is no different.  The turnover of the National Concert Hall is &euro;7 million per year, of which 70% comes from our own activities and 30% comes from grant-in-aid.  It is important to point out it was this model that allowed us to continue as a vibrant organisation even in the teeth of recession so we are grateful for that.  It was not without its challenges for the senior team and the chief executive officer, CEO, but the quality in terms of performance did not deteriorate, although perhaps the facilities have become a bit worn and tired.  <\/p> <p>  The unique role of the National Concert Hall in our national cultural landscape has been underpinned by the legislation passed last year.  We are grateful for the duality of confidence that everybody showed across both Houses in supporting that.  The legislation commits us to be seen worldwide as one of the great venues for music while playing a pivotal role in the music and cultural life of the Irish nation.  As members are aware, we have been home to the RTE National Symphony Orchestra in recent years.  Not unlike other European cities that have brought together synergistic cultural organisations - with Bilbao being a particular example - concentrating and having similar organisations resident in the National Concert Hall is very important for us and we want to develop that.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of time but just as my colleague here has said, 2022 will be important for us.  We are very conscious of the historic attachment of the National Concert Hall to Earlsfort Terrace where the previous treaty was signed.  We are delighted to say that the refurbishment of that room, which is now known as the Kevin Barry room, has taken place.  That was the first major refurbishment in quite a while.  It is worth a visit if members have not been there.  <\/p> <p>  That addresses the current situation.  The venue hosts over 1,000 events every year.  It is almost a 365 operation.  As a result of that, it is obviously going to need significant refurbishment but having said that, we had an audience last year of over 320,000, which is very significant from a participant and patron point of view.  It will not be any surprise to the committee to hear that the development and refurbishment of the National Concert Hall is a priority for me as chair designate, the board and the senior management team.  Specifically, we are looking at the refurbishment of the main auditorium, which is currently a 1,200-seater.  Priorities include an additional 500-seat space for further recitals, a dedicated education centre and rehearsal space for the RTE National Symphony Orchestra, improving public access because we want to be more diverse and participative to include all audiences and, more particularly, ensuring we have the proper infrastructure to facilitate digital distribution for our concert and education work, which is a Government strategy and is of primary importance to us given other educational and artistic endeavours.  We are aware this will require a major capital investment but we feel that as a national cultural institution, it is appropriate that we should look in the first instance to the State.  However, we also will look at other activities of sponsors and benefactors that we will enlist and enrol in that effort, in the same way we will enlist and enrol in broader audience participation as part of that.  We are also working with the OPW, which played a significant role in the refurbishment of the Kevin Barry room, on a master plan to look at what can be done to develop a centre for music with international standing of which we will all be proud.  <\/p> <p>  The ambition of the new board is to see the full potential of the National Concert Hall come to fruition over the next five years leading up to 2022.  With the refurbishment plans complete, we believe it will be a musical centre with international standing of which we will all be proud.  In addition, we like to think that we would have an outreach beyond Dublin so that we would be able to touch, enlist, enrol and invite other audiences of all ages.  We think that is a fundamental remit under the Act.  Moreover, we will broaden our audience beyond through the digital initiatives.  I hope it will be a centre worth visiting even for people who might not be of a musical persuasion.  If one looks at some other iconic venues throughout the world, one will see that sometimes someone will visit the Sydney Opera House or La Scala, Milan, just for the sense of being there.  We are looking forward to our main auditorium being resplendently refurbished.  Our CEO is working with the OPW on a very detailed and granular plan for that.  Above all, the aspiration is to be seen as a worldwide venue, one of the great venues for music, of which we can all be proud.  It may appear to be strategic and ambitious - and it is - but as William Shakespeare said, in dreams come responsibility.  The board will not be found wanting with regard to rigorous governance and careful management of all that is invested in us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maura McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo mh&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute; as sin.

While I was growing up, we often voted in Meath and would then switch to vote in Longford-Westmeath and sometimes just Westmeath.  The constituency is now Meath West so I am sure the Chairman will be familiar with the place.  It is called Killua.  For those members who are not familiar with the townland of Killua, it has a very rich hinterland in terms of its history and heritage.  I grew up beside Killua Castle, which was built in the late 1700s by the Chapman family, which was the landlord family at the time.  The Chapmans installed a variety of monuments around the area, including a monument to Sir Walter Raleigh.  As children, we thought that this was where the first potatoes were planted in Ireland so the next time, members are eating their plate of spuds, they can think about Killua.  It instilled in me a great sense of interest in my local heritage, community and culture.  Killua is not far from the cairns of Loughcrew.<\/p><p>I do not know if members have ever been to Loughcrew but it probably has the most incredible monuments in the whole country.  It is a beautifully peaceful place and quite uncrowded.  The OPW has done restoratory works there recently so it looks even better.<\/p><p> As a child I was a keeper of history.  I used to fly around on my bike talking to old people.  When I was 11 I got a scrapbook which I filled with mementos, letters and stories which I was able to get people in the area to tell.  I have always had a deep interest in history and in what forms our heritage and culture.  I was beyond excitement when I was invited onto and asked to chair the board of the National Museum.  It is an incredible privilege for me to do this job.<\/p><p> I have provided members with a paper showing where I come from and what I have done to date.  I have not had a lot of free time since I took on this job but I spend a fair amount of it visiting museums as that is my hobby.  I will visit a small county museum and, when abroad, I visit national museums.  They are my go-to places, the first stop when I arrive in a new place.  I had the pleasure of visiting Skansen, which is the oldest folklore museum in the world on a little island just outside Stockholm.  It showed me what can be done with very little.  There was a huge area of interactivity and great facilities for children in its outdoor museum where one can see deer through a gate.  I am also a mother and an aunt to a whole army of children who are all under the age of ten, which is around about the age of reason.  Museums can play a very important role in giving them a sense of history and of understanding and belonging so I have a consumer eye on the museum.<\/p><p> I am lucky to have a strong client base.  I work for myself in a company called DHR Communications.  We have a great team and are lucky to have many clients in the heritage and culture sector.  I will be high-tailing it up the road to Bellaghy in Derry tomorrow because I am working on the opening of the Heaney homeplace project.  I am very excited to be part of that.<\/p><p> I am highly involved in corporate social responsibility and have done some academic research and lectured at Columbia University in New York on the subject.  I hope that some of the learning and ideas I have around corporate social responsibility and how we can deepen partnerships with the business world will help to develop the museum over the coming years.  I am a former member of the Heritage Council and served as the chair of its finance and audit committee for a couple of years.  I will also bring my business management and leadership attributes to the role of chair of this board.  <\/p><p> It always surprises me how few Members of the Oireachtas I see in the museums or in the National Library or National Gallery.  If I am meeting a politician, I suggest the cafe at the National Library or the National Museum and they often tell me it is the first time they were there.  Accordingly, I invite all members of the committee, including absent members, to visit with me.  We will organise a tour of the museum at a time that suits them.  I would very much like them to  be able to come along as it is very important.  There would be a huge benefit as it is very crowded and tough around here and it would do wonders for members' head space for them to take a walk around the museum.  We have four public sites, two at either end of Leinster House, one at Collins Barracks and at the Museum of Country Life in Mayo.  The Oireachtas is very crowded at the moment and there are several committees so we could take a committee meeting to one of those sites, provided due notice was given.<\/p><p> The museum has a collection of over 4 million objects but only approximately 3% are on public display.  If we had more resources we would be able to display more material.  Our collection is housed in the collections resource centre in Swords, which is a very important piece of our infrastructure and a place where we can care for and develop the collections.  I have not been there myself but my parents had a farm and we had two muscovy ducks.  They were black and white and quite ugly but they admired themselves at the front door.  Their names were Ned and Rita but the fox got Rita and the drake was heartbroken so we decided to donate him to the museum.  I am hoping I will be reunited with Ned the muscovy duck when I go to Swords.  <\/p><p> The museum has excelled in growing visitor numbers, including over the course of this very deep recession.  The staff and the preceding board need to be commended on being so resilient despite incredible cuts.  The museum's budget has been reduced by 40% over the past eight years and there has been a 25% reduction in staff.  In addition, we started from a very low base because the cohort of staff we have at the National Museum is at less than 50% of its equivalent in Scotland.  It is a very serious issue for us.  We are in discussions with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government over the use of the ceramics room, which is one of our only public spaces in the Kildare Street site, and this is putting more pressure on us and on our staff.  It is a critical issue for us, particularly coming up to the budget.  We have laid our budgetary ask before the Minister and I will be happy to furnish the committee with a copy.  Funding and staffing are our biggest challenges and we are at a critical point in regard to those.<\/p><p> I want to be optimistic as, by nature, I see the glass as half full.  We are looking to develop a master plan for the next 15 years, which will be crucial to inform the future and our vision for the National Museum.  Culture 2025 has a great little nugget about multi-annual funding and multi-annual budgets.  The cultural sector and its institutions need that kind of back-up so that they can think ahead and plan for our cultural infrastructure.<\/p><p> I thank the incoming board of the National Museum and I feel the public appointments process has proven very robust.  There is an excellent range of skills on my board and I have enjoyed working with its members.  The Minister did a great job in the final selection to put in place such a mixture of skills.  This will be very important in building our way forward for the next couple of years.  Is pribhl&eacute;id m&oacute;r &iacute; bheith anseo.

I appreciate the great detail given to the committee by the witnesses and wish them good luck with their work.<\/p><p> I wish to start with a number of general questions, which can be addressed to each of the different sectors.  The Waking the Feminists campaign was very important in terms of bringing the issue of gender diversity in the arts to the fore.  Another very important issue is socioeconomic diversity.  When I was appointed as my party spokesperson for this area, I tabled several parliamentary questions to try to get a good understanding of the delivery of our services or at least, the opportunity to consume them or be part of them, for people at all socioeconomic levels.  I ask the witnesses to speak to that issue as it relates to their areas.  How do they ensure they are proofed in that regard?  <\/p><p> Regional development is one of the core objectives of this committee.  Unfortunately, when one looks at the spend, it always seems to be concentrated in Dublin, partly because some of the institutions are physically located in the capital.  In that context, I am very interested in the outreach programmes to which the witnesses referred earlier.  I know, for example, that in the Solstice Theatre in Navan there is a wonderful exhibition that includes four or five items on loan from the National Museum and which turns the space into a different type of experience.  I ask the witnesses to explain how best we can get into the nooks and crannies, not just with the Galway and Cork film fleadhs and so on, but further afield.  <\/p><p> It is very hard to estimate the value of an item without engaging in some sort of comparative work.  I am thankful the witnesses made reference to various institutions abroad and the work they are doing.  What is international best practice, particularly in the European sphere, in terms of outputs in the different areas?  How do the Irish institutions measure up?  What elements of that best practice do they expect to bring into their own spheres?  <\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to respond to those three general questions first and then we can move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#L00200","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475068500,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I am quite happy to start.  Waking the Feminists was a really important watershed moment for Irish society.  I am a member of the International Women's Forum, the Women's Executive Network and Women in Film and Television Ireland and have a personal history of many years of campaigning on gender equality, diversity and access to education.  It is something I am very passionate about.  Around the time that the Abbey Theatre was dealing with the Waking the Feminists movement and Lian Bell and others were working in that area, the new Irish Film Board, under my chairmanship, was also discussing gender diversity.  What we realised was that we had something to say about that too.  Last year we produced a six-point plan around gender diversity, which we published on our website.  That plan looks at gender diversity but obviously in our strategy, we are looking at diversity in general.  The six-point plan deals with education, training, awareness and with the unconscious bias that exists in the film industry along with all other industries.  We were out of the traps pretty quickly after Waking the Feminists in producing a plan.  What we have been doing since then is qualitative work, including running seminars on diversity and inclusion in film.  We have also been doing quantitative work, collecting statistics on the number of films we are funding that have women directors and cinematographers and the number that represent issues such as regionalism, diversity, the Irish language and so forth.  We have become very aware and I would like to think that part of that is because of me, in my role as chair, saying this something about which I am passionate but I also had a board and executive in the Irish Film Board who were very keen to do this as well.  If members look at the Irish Film Board website, they will see that, every quarter, we are making progress in terms of diversity.<\/p> <p>  In terms of diversity, we have focused on gender but we also have been looking at the regions.  The Irish Film Board is based in Galway, with some staff based in Dublin.  We have been looking not only at Cork and Galway but also at festivals deep in the regions and at the development of audiences.  What are the stories that the regions need to hear?  I mentioned \"A Date for Mad Mary\", which is set in Drogheda.   It may only be up the road, but not many films have come out of Drogheda.  Moreover, \"The Young Offenders\" is set in Cork, we have had the Dingle Film Festival as I mentioned earlier and we are working with the regions to develop film and film festivals.  The regional, diversity and equality agendas are very important in terms of telling stories about the breadth of experience in Ireland.  We are not Dublin-centric but are telling stories about people who have diverse lives and diverse experiences.  Through our six-point plan around gender and our commitment to diversity in our strategy, we are really focusing on that.  That is filtering out into the industry.  People are realising that we do not want to tell one side of any story.  We want to tell stories from across the diverse range of the population in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the international scene, the Chairman's question is very interesting.  We do a lot of co-production work with Canada, the UK and other countries.  Successful films like \"Room\" and \"Brooklyn\" were co-productions.  We are used to seeing what is good practice elsewhere and where we need to benchmark.  We do a lot of benchmarking against countries like Sweden, for example, which has a very vibrant industry and is very strong on the issues of equality and diversity.  We look at good practice in Canada, we attend the international film festivals, we are in constant dialogue with others and are part of European film projects through Eurimages and so forth.  We are constantly examining good practice in the industry and finding ways to work with and learn from others.  The committee can be confident that the board and I are doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Annie Doona"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475068500,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will address the feminist question first and then the questions on outreach and socioeconomic diversity, which are particularly important.  It is interesting to note that 60% or 70% of the audience of the National Concert Hall is female, so from that point of view, women are very well represented.  However, if one looks at the artists, the picture is different.  When the National Concert Hall was developing the Composing the Island project, for example, very few female composers were included at the early stages.  I cannot give the committee a percentage change in that regard but if members look at our current calendar of events, there is a very equal distribution with regard to artists representing both genders.  That is one element of the issue, in terms of providing role models in terms of performance and participation.  This issue is addressed in our strategy, in terms of the National Concert Hall being a diverse organisation at operational level and through its outreach programmes and this is something about which we will be more deliberate as we move forward.  In my own personal experience, I have been very passionate with regard to equality across all areas and am committed to continuing that.  For me, it is part of the way we live and the way we behave.<\/p> <p>  The question of socioeconomic equality and making the arts available to everyone is interesting.  One of the wonderful things about the National Concert Hall is that, from a price point of view, it recently was made affordable for people, which is extremely important.  I am not sure, not having researched the issue, but I think there are some concerts which are offered free of charge.  Socioeconomic considerations, from an attendance point of view, are very important.  I do not think price is a prohibitor because we have many ways of looking at it but at the same time, we are a commercial organisation in part and so must think about it from that point of view. <\/p> <p>  Outreach is a major consideration for the National Concert Hall, in terms of getting to wider audiences, including those from different socioeconomic groups.  In that context, digitisation is very important in terms of offering virtual opportunities.  Children sitting in classrooms all over this country should be able to switch on and watch the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, for example, playing in the concert hall, at little or no cost.  That is where we are coming from on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maura McGrath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475068500,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I will start with the question on diversity.  One of the very worrying elements of our museum, particularly on the Kildare Street and Merrion Street sites, is neither has access for people with mobility issues.  It is very disappointing this still is the case in 2016.  This issue is on the table for our board and I have raised it in the Houses of the Oireachtas and with the Government during our discussions on the use of the ceramics room to facilitate Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The board is conscious of this.  Our cultural institutions must be open and publicly accessible, regardless of people's abilities or otherwise.<\/p><p> Regarding inclusion, entry to national museums is free of charge.  Sometimes, the queue at Blanchardstown shopping centre on a Sunday, from the Navan side in particular, is longer than at the museum.  It is up to us to encourage people to change the way they do their business on a Sunday afternoon.  There is a wonderful free exhibition in Collins Barracks on the 1916 Rising and if members have not seen it, I recommend it to them.  It is full of artefacts that represent individuals from 1916, for example, cigarette packs, playing cards, etc.  They were retrieved from Kilmainham Gaol the night before the executions and are engaging.  The 1916 Rising commemorations have been brilliant in engaging children in school.  I cannot understate the power of engaging children early in appreciating culture.  This helps the process of inclusion, as it opens their minds and attitudes to other things.  For this reason, it is incumbent on us and politicians to talk more about engaging and appreciating culture.  It is not aloof - it is for everyone.  This something about which I feel strongly.<\/p><p> I turn to the issue of best practice.  The museum probably led the decentralisation programme, as we have been located in County Mayo for nearly two decades.  We are proud of this.  We loan to county museums.  There may be issues with museum practice and ensuring the museums to which we loan are competent and have the capacity to look after artefacts.  There are also associated cost issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Heaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I have a couple of topical questions, the first of which may be for Dr. Doona.

It obviously has a cost for the State because, from the outside, there seems to be at least an allegation of dysfunction that is leading to HR difficulties.

The Irish Film Board's view is that the Picture Palace will be a tremendous asset to Galway.  A few minutes ago we discussed the importance of the regions and not being Dublin centric.  Ireland's only dedicated arthouse cinemas are in Dublin, which does not serve the regions well.  The vision was to change this.  Galway is a UNESCO-designated city of film and hosts the highly successful Film Fleadh every year, but it is short of the right environment and the right space.  Our belief is the cinema is badly needed.  We are frustrated and disappointed that the project has taken so long to come to fruition and by some of the ways in which it has been rolled out.  A considerable amount of public funding has gone into it.  The Irish Film Board was a minority funder, but we nevertheless had to be careful.  In our three years of dealing with it the board has engaged in due diligence and followed due process in investing money and knows exactly what is happening with it.  There are issues with the recession and the Picture Palace, but our concern is that the building should be finished, the Department should invest money and that there should be excellent governance.  We had some concerns which we articulated about the length of time it was taking and some of the issues that occurred along the way.  We believe in the project and want to see it finished as it is important for the people of Galway.  We have been frustrated.

Section 481 has been very important for the Irish film industry and we welcomed its roll-out and expansion.  It helps us to compete internationally and helps us with inward investment and in developing the film industry that we want to see.<\/p> <p>  I think Senator Warfield asked me what will help create a good Irish film industry.  There are a number of factors to that.  One is education and training and the Senator mentioned the educational institutions in Galway.  My national film school is IADT.  There is a real need to grow and develop the next generation of indigenous film-makers, editors and producers.  That will really help us.  The issue of studio space, which is partly being addressed now, is very important.  We have seen some productions go elsewhere because, we are delighted to say, the studios here are very busy.  However, if we could expand that studio space and what is available for people to allow them to come here and bring that inward investment, as well as develop the industry, that would really help us.<\/p> <p>  We do a lot of work with Northern Ireland Screen.  We co-fund projects with it, including \"The Truth Commissioner\".  Northern Ireland Screen also provides funding to inward productions in Northern Ireland and promotes Irish film, so we have a very good relationship with Northern Ireland Screen and we want to continue that cross-Border working and development.<\/p> <p>  Funding is a big issue for us.  Our funding was &euro;20 million back in 2008 but now it is around &euro;12 million.  We got an additional &euro;500,000 from the Minister last year, for which we were very grateful, but as I said earlier, film investment occurs over a long number of years, in individuals, in projects and in companies, so we could do so much more.  We did a huge amount and got huge international acclaim with a small amount of money but we turned down projects.  I will give the committee a concrete example of this.  We have already had to halt the amount of money for animation film production this year because it has almost doubled from what we funded last year.  The applications for animation feature films, on the back of the success of films like \"Song of the Sea\" is great but we do not have the money at the moment to fund those and we do not have the staff to do that work with the animation sector.  We are doing as much as we can with a small budget.  We genuinely believe that with a return to that &euro;20 million funding, we would see much more film production, much more inward investment, more co-production and an even better, even stronger and more economically productive film industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Annie Doona"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Regarding access to the national cultural institutions, Ms Heaney mentioned Mayo.

It is not all down to funding either as leadership is required as well.  The Minister is in the room.  We have Culture 2025 and it is really important that she is not the only person flying the flag for that.  Putting culture back on the political agenda is probably a shared responsibility of this committee.  Culture has really taken a hammering over the past decade.  It needs to come back on the agenda.  We have talked about the importance of how culture can influence outcomes in life.  That is why that political will is required.  It is a shared thing.  We should be in here not just once but all the time engaging with the committee.  That would be a big help.  There are also planks of Culture 2025 that concern the loaning out of collections and how we can facilitate that by ensuring best practice in managing collections.  There is also clearly a funding issue involved in that.  The other piece that is very exciting in Culture 2025 is the whole idea of collaborating.  Even in the conversations we were having outside during our long wait to get in here, we were talking about how we can better collaborate.  There are many different aspects in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The other great thing that we all need to embrace is digitisation and access to collections through digitisation.

I urge that that continue because when \"Star Wars\" or \"The Runway\" comes to town, it is a huge boost to the local area, whether it be food outlets, local businesses or bed and breakfasts as accommodation is needed.

There is a golden opportunity to do that from this point of view.  As I said earlier, there are wonderful opportunities from now through to our refurbishment to consider venues across the country and to bring what is currently on Earlsfort Terrace, but has not always been there, right around.

The regional aspect is very important for the Irish Film Board.  \"Star Wars\" not only brought inward investment and tourism and filled bed and breakfast rooms, it also highlighted Ireland as a beautiful location and a good location to make films.  The word got out that we have creative talented people at all levels, great locations and a Government that is interested in film and culture.  I have a list of regional projects.  \"Redwater\" was filmed in Waterford and is coming out soon, \"The Breadwinner\" was animated in Kilkenny and \"Halal Daddy\" was filmed in Sligo.  This year, films have been made in and highlight a series of locations throughout the country, and we have put this in our submission.

In addition, a further &euro;6.158 million in funding was carried over from the 2015 capital provision.  Gross total expenditure incurred by the Department to 30 June 2016 was just under &euro;146 million.  This expenditure represents 38% of the overall 2016 gross allocation for the Department.  The capital carryover of &euro;6.158 million was also expended in full.  Total gross expenditure by the Department up to and including 31 August has increased to &euro;195.8 million, or 51% of the overall 2016 allocation.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, this has been a very significant year for the Department.  In addition to an expansion of its remit to include responsibility for regional development and rural affairs, a key priority under A Programme for a Partnership Government, 2016 marks the centenary of the Easter 1916 Rising, providing us with an opportunity to remember and reflect on this pivotal event in our history.  There were highlights in other programme areas, too, about which my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Sean Kyne and Michael Ring, and I will speak briefly on a programme by programme basis.  We will commence with the arts, culture and film programme and will be happy to expand  on any matter members may wish to raise.<\/p> <p>  Programme A covers the arts, culture and film, for which over &euro;188 million has been provided in 2016, with a capital carryover of further &euro;6.158 million.  Total gross expenditure up to 30 June was &euro;82.362 million or 46% of the 2016 programme allocation.  The capital carryover of &euro;6.158 million was also expended in full.  By 31 August, expenditure had increased to &euro;106.92 million or 59% of the 2016 programme allocation.  Owing to the scale and complexity of once-off aspects of the capital and current programmes, some adjustments have been made to allocations within the programme.  For example, savings have arisen in subhead A.15 - Decade of Centenaries 1912 to 1922 - due to a combination of outside factors and also in subhead A.16 - Cork Event Centre which has not progressed as promptly as anticipated.  Sanction has been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use these savings to address emerging pressures in other programme areas.  <\/p> <p>  I have mentioned the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme, but I would like to address the initiative in a little more detail.  There was an extensive education programme delivered across all levels, including the Permanent Reminder component, through which a number of significant capital projects were completed, and an extensive programme of State ceremonial and public events and a community strand delivered in conjunction with local authorities.  As part of the national flag initiative, flags and copies of the Proclamation by the Defence Forces were delivered to over 3,300 national schools across the country.  In the Permanent Reminder component of the programme works were completed at the GPO Witness History Centre, Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry Rooms at the National Concert Hall and the Athenaeum in Enniscorthy.  Work at the Tenement Museum in Henrietta Street and Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc, County Galway is also nearing completion.  <\/p> <p>  The series of major public events, including the State ceremonial events, proved to be a particular highlight, with an unprecedented level of public awareness and engagement.  Some 750,000 people attended the \"Reflecting the Rising\" event on Easter Monday, following on from the official commemoration at the GPO on Easter Sunday which was enjoyed by 4,500 invited guests and 300,000 members of the general public who lined the streets on the day.  <\/p> <p>  Another very important element of the 2016 commemorations was the numerous events held to mark the Battle of the Somme.  I travelled to France on 1 July to participate in the major ceremony at Thiepval, which was followed by a wreath laying ceremony at the Ulster tower.  Earlier this month I returned to Guillemont to remember the 1,200 members of the 16th Irish Division who had lost their lives there in September 1916.  These events complemented the Government's Somme commemorative event held in Islandbridge in July.  <\/p> <p>  Other ambitious capital projects under the programme also progressed significantly in 2016, with the master development plan at the National Gallery of Ireland entering its final phase, while the design phase of the proposed major capital investment at the National Library of Ireland is progressing, as is the new cultural and heritage centre at Bank of Ireland, College Green.<\/p> <p>  A new six-year &euro;18 million capital investment scheme focused on enhancing the existing stock of arts and cultural centres throughout the country was launched in July.  Some 100 applications have been received to date under the scheme.  In the first half of 2016 over 1.8 million people visited national cultural institutions.  If these numbers are maintained in the second half of the year, it will represent an increase of 3% on the very impressive 2015 figure of 3.5 million.  <\/p> <p>  I am happy to expand on any issue arising in respect of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#Q00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister on the 1916 Rising commemorative programme.  While I was critical of it initially, since the commencement of the second iteration of the programme launched at Collins Barracks, it has been very successful, with all of the money provided having been well spent.<\/p> <p>  On Friday we will be nine months through the year.  With the budget due to be announced in less than a fortnight, the big issue is what will happen next year because things are not expected to change that much.  <\/p> <p>  There are some interesting reflections in the programme for Government on the importance of the arts.  A country that expends on the arts, cultural and heritage projects is more prosperous.  More importantly, it leads to a much better quality of life.  However, it is worth reflecting on the issue of prosperity.  The more I read about the 1916 Rising and the lead-in to it, the cultural renaissance and so on, I can see that one of the most interesting comparisons concerns the economic performance in the 100 years since between the North and the South.  Obviously, the South has outperformed the North, even though it remains in the bigger economic entity, the empire.  On the reasons for this, my view is that it has nothing to do with military aspects and gun-fighting and so on but is related to the cultural renaissance, self-belief and everything culture in its widest sense brings, irrespective of whose it is and so on, which issue was the subject of much debate previously.  I have a broad view of culture.  All culture is to be treasured, although we have a special space in our hearts for the culture that is indigenous to any of the peoples on the island.  <\/p> <p>  Having read the mid-year expenditure review, for me, the big issue is the proposal to reduce the budget of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for next year by &euro;55 million.  I would have thought that it would have held on to the same allocation as for 2016.<\/p><p>There are three big pressure points for the Department.  We will come to the rural, regional, Gaeltacht and the islands elements, which I see as two points, but the other one takes in arts, culture and heritage.  I would have thought it was very important that we would unanimously seek the &euro;383 million funding for the Minister in the resource allocation for 2016 again for next year.  Some things never change over on Merrion Street and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is proposing &euro;327 million.  That does not mean the &euro;55 is unaffordable; if it can be afforded this year, it can be afforded next year.  If we had the &euro;55 million, we could fight about the split but if we do not get the money, we cannot fight about the split.  We must put meat on the fine commitment in the programme for Government to the arts and heritage.  It includes the arts and heritage councils, as well as the national institutions that add so much to our well-being as a people and which are very important in terms of tourism and so on.<br\/><br\/>We need a significant rise to where the funding used to be.  I was looking at figures and the Arts Council is down something like &euro;5 million in five years at a time when, to be honest, there is inflation.  The Heritage Council has stated it cannot do anything to assist people with heritage properties and although we are putting restrictions on people, there is no money to help them preserve the properties, so some of them are going to rack and ruin.  Our cultural institutions are flagship institutions.  Basically, the big issue today is to consider what is happening to ensure the &euro;383 million remains in the Department and that it can be spent next year, so the Ministers of State, Deputies Ring and Kyne, along with the Minister can have the resources implied in the programme for Government.  Otherwise, we are moving the chairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>and we will not be able to do anything radically different from last year.  We will remain &quot;as is&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I know the battle the Minister is facing.  From my end and that of my party, we will give the Minister full support in the battle to retain what she had last year, no more and no less.  If she had that, we would collectively honour the importance of these issues.  As I said, we can consider 1916 and that matters of the mind often triumph over matters of the body.  Cerebral issues, including culture, are so important to the human spirit.  There are hard-nosed people; as Pearse wrote, the men in the counting houses, and the Minister needs to go them and say &quot;but what if my dream comes true?&quot;.  In the end, Pearse's dream triumphed over the men in the counting houses who knew the cost of everything and value of nothing.  The Minister will certainly have my support in fighting Merrion Street to realise this is not a peripheral extra to government but rather goes to the core of who we are as a people.  She will have my support in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#Q00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments on the 2016 commemorations.  Its success came from collaboration, with everybody working together right across the country, including local authorities and communities.  There was an invitation we extended for people to come forward with their ideas and everybody worked together to make it what it was.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that culture is so important.  I attended an event last night and saw a young girl who was only 16 years old.  The evening, organised by Dublin City Council, was about working with communities in culture, bringing arts into the community.  A number of different communities benefited from it.  The girl, named Samantha, got up to speak and said that when she saw culture, she saw hope.  That resonates very much with us all.  These people are going into communities across the city and working with them in putting together cultural projects.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the budget, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, outlined the position very clearly at the budget oversight committee last week.  There must be a level of realism in terms of expectations.  Approximately &euro;600 million is available in current spending for new policy initiatives, and of that &euro;70 million has been allocated for the increased cost of the housing assistance and rent supplement payments.  There is &euro;250 million available in capital spending and of that &euro;150 million will go towards measures in the housing action plan.  Members should appreciate that what is left over after that will be relatively small, particularly when one considers it must be divided between 15 Departments.  I assure members that I will continue to make the strongest case possible for my own Department.  I must be straight too, as there will not be any miracles on budget.  There will be modest amount of funding available.  I make the case for my Department and I know I will not be able to meet every demand as the resources simply are not there.  I must try to find a balance.  I appreciate the support of the committee in that respect.

It is a large public area and there can be differences in opinions on how things can be done.<\/p><p> I concur with previous speakers that the allocation of moneys by a Government is its articulation of policy intent.  The fact that the arts and Irish language have been the poor relations in the Department speaks loudly to many people in these sectors around the country where they appear in the pecking order of Government priority. <\/p><p> A line in one of the Department's documents reads, \"To promote and develop Ireland world class artistic\" development, etc.  So far, I have not seen comparative analysis within the documentation from the Department.  World class arts can only be measured in a comparative fashion against other jurisdictions.  Earlier the chairperson designate for the National Concert Hall was in attendance and we had an interesting discussion on the fact that 320,000 people visit the venue.  It seems a great figure but I wonder has the Department compared that number with the equivalent of the National Concert Hall in Denmark as the country is similar in size?  What outputs per euro does the hall in Denmark receive from state investment?  It is not a problem if the Minister does not have those figures.  I would like if the Department delivered to the committee a comparative analysis in terms of bang for buck and outputs, although clearly the Department cannot be measured just in terms of bang for buck.  Has the Department carried out comparisons?  If not, will the Minister consider doing so?  <\/p><p> My next question is topical and relates to the Irish Film Board.  Last night a \"Prime Time\" debate on the Picture Palace in Galway was broadcast.  A lot of people are deeply concerned that &euro;9 million from multiple State sources was invested in the building yet it stands in dereliction.  Is the Minister happy that the investment by the State is fully safeguarded?<\/p><p> There seems to be a difference of opinion between the Minister and the chief executive of Galway City Council.  The Minister felt that the building was in the ownership or at least the control of the city council.

Do I refuse to give it further funding or do I consider a request for funding to finish the building in the knowledge that I knew there would have to be a fit-out?  The cost involved was in the region of &euro;1 million.  I had to decide whether to spend a further &euro;1 million and provide much needed art infrastructure in Galway.  The importance of the arts to Galway was outlined earlier.  The city has the Galway Film Fleadh, an arts festival and it has won the Capital of Culture for 2020.

My knowledge of its success comes through experiencing the programme locally in County Galway.  The event in Athenry was of an extraordinarily high standard.  Given the quality of the production and the performances, it was a world-class event that could have been taken on tour the following day to a number of locations across the globe and it would have represented Ireland in an exceptionally positive light in terms of our artistic and cultural heritage.<\/p> <p>  I also commend the Minister on the work she just described on securing the future of our cinema in Galway.  The artistic community in Galway has identified the serious dearth of performance facilities in the town on a number of occasions.  Galway city and county have now secured the European Capital of Culture 2020.  I commend the Minister on using the final &euro;1 million to safeguard the cinema.  A significant investment had already been made in the building.<\/p> <p>  I have a final observation.  The success of the 1916-2016 programme trickled all the way down to tiny villages and towns across this country and leveraged a huge amount of community endeavour.  That is an extraordinarily powerful example of what can happen when there is a bottom-up approach to nurturing cultural and artistic endeavour in a country.  My recent experience of Culture Night on 16 September brought that home to me.  When we support our towns and villages across the country - beyond the traditional flagship events such as Galway Arts Festival, Spraoi and Dublin Theatre Festival - by reaching out and giving a helping hand to small communities, they can perform with some exceptionally powerful events.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall policy of the Department and how it intends to support artistic endeavour in the future, is a change of heart likely in terms of supporting that type of endeavour from the bottom up?  Culture Night is one event, one night during the year, and it is extraordinarily successful.  The programme of events across County Galway took up two pages in our local provincial newspaper and more communities are coming on board every year.  Events such as the Shorelines Arts Festival in Portumna are supported by the Arts Council.  My assessment of how this works is that it must be a large and accomplished event, with a similar group of people behind the event, before it begins to feature on the radar of the Arts Council and the Department nationally.  Is there a way to devolve more power and funds to the local authorities, which have considerable expertise in this area, to reach out and begin the nurturing of the arts and the enriching of people's lives, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v eloquently described it?  Can we devolve more power and funding to the local authorities, which I believe are doing an exceptional job in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#T01200","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy about the local authorities.  I am a great believer in the bottom-up approach and I took that decision in 2014 when we launched the consultation process for an overarching plan for the 2016 commemorations.  Local authorities are the key to local communities and I believe in that approach.  I am anxious to see arts and culture supported in every local authority area.  I feel very strongly about that.  When one looks at the 2016 programme and all of the communities that ran their own events, they engaged with and were facilitated by the local authorities.  Only three weeks ago I met all of the local authority 2016 co-ordinators and asked them how we could build on the legacy of 2016 and have something permanent to remember what has happened in this special year.  Again, it is about working with them.  The arts officer, heritage officer, librarian and museum curator are a very strong part of our cultural offering locally and we must weld them together in a type of cultural unit in every local authority.  I am very keen on that.<\/p> <p>  We have the same theme in the Culture 2025 policy framework - working more collaboratively across Government and drawing on the lessons of the centenary year.  It includes re-examining the provision of cultural services at local level and building on existing connections between local authorities, the Arts Council and the Heritage Council.  Indeed, I attended an event today with the Arts Council where it is working collaboratively with the local authorities.  The council said it had renewed its vows with the local authorities in terms of its engagement with them.  It is very important to work with all of the local authorities across the country and also with Foras na Gaeilge and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The organisations are all in place so we must tap into them and work collaboratively in terms of culture.  We also wish to examine the role of voluntary organisations and develop policies to provide increased support.  These are the priorities in the document and now it is about drawing up actions for how to achieve that.  That is what we are doing at present in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#T01300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>We will move to section B.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#T01400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I have two brief questions on section A.  The Moore Street case is being undertaken with the approval of the Attorney General's office.

It is not usually taken from an ordinary budget.  It is normally provided for if and when it arises.  It is very much a question of if and when, and it might never arise.<\/p><p>On the second point, I remember years ago the issue of the repair of the <i>Jeanie Johnston <\/i>came up.

It was a case of in for a penny, in for a pound and complete the project.<br\/><br\/>I have to say, not because it happens to be in Galway, that the Solas Galway Picture Palace project cannot be left as it is.

That is my very strong view and I support the Minister's view.  I call that type of scenario a Jeanie Johnston because I remember some highly educated people felt we should have left the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i>in the condition it was in, following the expenditure of &euro;13 million, and not continue to restore it at a cost of &euro;14 million in total.

I am delighted that the gardens in Killarney House opened to the public shortly after Easter and were opened officially by me last month.  Glenveagh National Park also had a high profile visit in June, when his Royal Highness Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall made a historic visit.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department played a central role in licensing and supervising the historic filming of \"Star Wars\" at various sites along the Wild Atlantic Way in May and June and in assisting with the filming of the programme for the new series of \"Top Gear\" at Killarney National Park.  All of these promotions serve to bring the beauty of our national parks and landscape to a wider global audience.

A similar issue arose between 1997 and 2001 in respect of archaeology and a very good protocol was drawn up that seems to have largely resolved such issues when major infrastructure has been developed.

There are more than 80 commitments in the programme for Government for delivery across a range of Departments and agencies, which will have a positive impact on rural Ireland.  My Department has been tasked with providing greater co-ordination and prioritisation of the work across Government in areas that impact on rural Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department is also directly responsible for the delivery of a number of programmes and initiatives to support rural development.  In this context, my Department's Vote includes &euro;61.2 million under programme E for regional development and rural affairs.  Of this, &euro;58.2 million or 95% of the total relates to direct programme expenditure, with the balance covering pay and non-pay administration costs.  Total gross expenditure for programme E up to 30 June 2016 was &euro;8.694 million, which accounts for 15% of the 2016 allocation.  By 31 August 2016, the figure had increased to &euro;10.71 million or 18.5% of the 2016 allocation programme.<\/p><p> Since I last met the committee on the 2016 Estimates, I have established a new division for regional and rural affairs in the Department and announced a number of initiatives which were committed to in A Programme for a Partnership Government to support rural development.  These include the launch of the 2014-20 Leader programme, which has a budgetary allocation of &euro;250 million over its lifetime; the launch of the town and village renewal scheme with funding of &euro;10 million for 2016; the launch of a new round of the rural economic development zone, REDZ, initiative with &euro;5 million available for the scheme this year; a new round of rural recreation project funding, with total approvals of &euro;4.5 million to 75 projects nationwide; and the establishment of a national task force to identify practical measures which can be taken in the short term to improve access to broadband and mobile telephone reception in rural areas.  My Department is working closely with local authorities to prepare for the roll-out of broadband under the national broadband plan when contracts are awarded in 2017.<\/p><p> While these initiatives individually will make a contribution to rural development, it is their combined impact, along with other initiatives across government, which will make a real and sustainable difference to rural areas.  To ensure a more integrated approach to rural development across government, my Department has commenced work on preparing an action plan for rural development.  The action plan will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across government to support economic and social progress in rural areas.  I have arranged an information session on the action plan for Members of the Oireachtas in Leinster House tomorrow at 9 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#X02600","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.

It always amazes me when we speak about rural Ireland that people believe tens of millions of euro will be a sufficient allocation.  When problems arise in urban areas, we all accept that hundreds of millions of euro will be required, even if the problem is a finite one.  For example, &euro;200 million was announced recently to fund basic infrastructure in Dublin to open up sites and allow housing to be built.  We would not have such a housing problem in Dublin if more people stayed in rural areas.  We also heard about an investment of &euro;500 million in Limerick city.  While I am not against such investment, if a city with a population of 80,000 people needs this level of funding, how do we expect areas with a total population of 2 million people to be developed suddenly with expenditure of &euro;3 million, &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million?<\/p><p>The Minister was able to provide the Minister of State with &euro;19 million borrowed from the Leader programme this year.  Put another way, the underspend in the Leader programme, which I predicted at our previous meeting, has been allocated to projects within the remit of the Minister of State.  This is a welcome development.<\/p><p>It is also striking that expenditure on rural and regional affairs in the first half of this year amounted to only &euro;8.6 million or &euro;4 <i>per capita<\/i>.  If anybody believes this level of spending will resolve the problems faced by rural Ireland when billions are needed to sort out problems in our cities, then rural Ireland must be the greatest place on earth.  Rural areas have great potential but they need investment.<\/p><p>A major saving will be recorded in the Leader programme this year.  How much of the &euro;40 million provided for the programme will not be spent?  The Minister correctly decided not to return these savings to the Exchequer or roll them into next year and, instead, &euro;6 million was reallocated to town and village regeneration, &euro;5 million to the national rural development schemes, &euro;4 million to rural recreation projects, &euro;1 million for rural broadband and &euro;3 million for CL&Aacute;R infrastructure.  The allocation for this year has, therefore, been fixed, which is fine.  However, I presume the Department will need &euro;40 million for the Leader programme next year.  Does the Minister anticipate spending &euro;40 million on administration and projects under the programme next year?  If so, where will she secure the &euro;19 million required just to stay still in the other programmes I outlined?  Will they go by the wayside?<\/p><p>If &euro;40 million is not expended under the Leader programme next year, we will fall far behind the &euro;250 million expenditure target which, in any case, amounts to only &euro;25 <i>per capita<\/i>for the population of the Gaeltacht.  If the full allocation is spent, where will the money come from to maintain expenditure on other schemes at the current levels?<\/p><p>Will funding be provided to the mountain rescue service?  I address that question to the Minister of State.  I understand Mountain Rescue Ireland has been in negotiations with the Department and has met Comhairle na Tuaithe.  Rural recreation cannot be developed if people who are lost or injured cannot be moved off mountains.  Somebody must take responsibility for this because Mountain Rescue Ireland has a major problem with equipment and insurance.<\/p><p>Is it intended to focus only on towns and villages and ignore the fact that the majority of people in rural areas live in parishes and the countryside rather than the towns in which the Department of<b><\/b>Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government wants them to live?  Most GAA teams are parish rather than town based.  Will this geographical reality be recognised and will money be provided for the basic infrastructure required by those of us who happen to live in houses outside towns and villages?<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on getting the CL&Aacute;R scheme back on the agenda.  He has done the big job first in ensuring the Vote includes a line for the CL&Aacute;R programme.  This is a major achievement.  While &euro;3 million is a tiny allocation, he will have a job spending it by the end of the year.  I wish him good luck in accepting that challenge.  On what does he propose to spend this funding?  Will he seek to secure for next year the level of funding that used to be provided for the CL&Aacute;R scheme?  While it will be challenging to spend money under the scheme in the short term, will he seek &euro;20 million or thereabouts for the scheme next year?  Failing that, it will not be the CL&Aacute;R programme but a leithsc&eacute;al de chl&aacute;r.<\/p><p>In view of the new census figures showing many rural areas with a steep decline in population, is it proposed to revise the CL&Aacute;R areas, which were determined scientifically and objectively on the basis of having experienced a population decline of 30%?<\/p><p> There is &euro;1 million allocated for the roll-out of broadband.  It is extraordinary what is going on.  At the moment Eir, a private company, is rolling out eFibre to homes in many places in Ireland, including Corr na M&oacute;na, where I live, which is very rural.  What is the &euro;1 million being spent on if a private company can just get on with the job and bring eFibre at 1 Gb if customers give it &euro;30 or &euro;40 a month?  Will the Minister explain what exactly is being done with the &euro;1 million when, way ahead of the Government doing this, the fibre is being rolled out by a private company without all the backup?  All it is doing is hanging the fibre on the existing telephone poles, taking down the copper wiring and away we ago, all happy and home for tea.  Instead of a bit of copper coming into a house, a bit of fibre comes in to the house.  One is able to switch in and there is nothing much more to it.<\/p><p> With regard to the Leader programme will the Minister clarify that there was a limit of &euro;500,000-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#Y00400","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#Z00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Chairman will give me a minute and a half - there was a limit of &euro;500,000 to ensure Leader programme money was spent on projects that would be there for the long distance future, because &euro;1 million does very little these days?

Will the Minister confirm that is what has happened and will she explain the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>behind it?  It seems that it is going to diminish the effect of the Leader programme in moving away from very small projects that are not long term to ones that would have significant long-term distance?<\/p><p>My last two questions will be very quick.  Has the Department any plans to fund Rural Resettlement Ireland?  It is my understanding that it has no source of funding and it has been doing good work repopulating rural Ireland and bringing in people from the urban areas where there is excessive pressure.  Will the Department fund that organisation to ensure its long-term existence?<\/p><p>Has the Department any plans to provide long-term funding for social farming?

The &euro;10 million for the village renewal is very welcome, and even though it is only a small amount, it is a step in the right direction.  I believe the local authorities are to submit their applications to the Department for approval by Friday.  I ask that the Minister does not delay long in turning it around.  I understand that the work must be completed and the money drawn down before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Leader programme, it is my understanding that no money has come to any development company yet nor has the funding been given to them, or indeed to IRD Duhallow or to the north-east Kerry or south Kerry partnerships.  There was &euro;250 million announced.  Is it coming next year?  It has not arrived yet so are we talking about 2017?  Will we get extra funding when we go into another year given that the Department has saved so much this year?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that a further &euro;3 million is being added to the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I can tell her that for the past ten years we did not get a bone farthing.  Was some section of the community or some part of Ireland being included, was it left included or was it still getting funded?  We were not getting any and it meant an awful lot.  I ask that our fair share is given to us in Kerry because there are a lot of little roads that used to be done under that scheme, along with group water schemes, and for which there is now a demand again.  Even group sewerage schemes in certain places qualified.  If the Minister is saying to me that a further &euro;3 million is available, I want to know how much was being given out to the other counties in recent years.<\/p> <p>  We all have a wish list and I have already spoken about local improvement schemes.  The Minister gave me an answer and I could not get back to her.  She said that the local authorities were still allowed to do local improvement schemes.  Of course they can do them but they must get the funding.  There is currently funding for five schemes this year.  We have 160 schemes on our list sanctioned and approved.  There are 500 or more waiting to be assessed.  At five a year it will take about 200 years to deal with what is inside the offices of Kerry County Council.  I remember years when we did about 48 or 50 schemes.  Some years we did 110 or 111 schemes in one year.  I want that kind of money restored to those people on those roads.<\/p> <p>  I can remember my father telling me that in 2010 the Department of Finance tried to get the former Minister for transport, Noel Dempsey to abolish that scheme.  He did not let them that year.  However, the next year the then Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, abolished the scheme and it was ordained by the Department of Finance.  It said that it was not fair for the taxpayer to be paying for private roads.  However, these are not essentially private roads.  They are private in the sense that they are not in the control of the local authority but there are as many as ten, 12 or 15 houses on some of these roads.  They pay their car tax, their property tax and every other thing they are being asked to pay for.  They have their own water and are not looking for free water.  They have to provide their own septic tanks.  They are entitled to a road to their door if there is money and if things are improving a bit.  These people have been languishing since 2008.  Some of these people have made their application under this scheme as far back as that and they are languishing.  We are nearly going into 2020 and there is no sign of any improvement for them.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is from rural Ireland also.  She should not tell me that the local authorities have the funding to do the work because they do not have it.  They only get so much for the county roads programme and if they take the funds from that then some other road that was on the list for the three-year roads programme would have to forgo the money, which would not be fair.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to hog the meeting but I am glad to get the opportunity.

They are looking for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to take that over, and I will.  I shall explain why.  The same thing happened in the previous Department which covered it, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Nobody would give them any funding.  I put up a scheme, which I should not have done and I was advised by officials not to do it, but I did it because I felt that mountain rescue was entitled to support.  At the time I gave them &euro;3.5 million - I am open to correction on that figure - under the sports capital programme, even though technically it was not sports capital.  A lot of walking, cycling and other sports facilities take place and the mountain rescue people would be there so I gave them some funding.  It is an area I will look at again because I think they deserve support.  They do a tremendous job and deserve to be supported.  They do it in a voluntary capacity and they should have the equipment and whatever they need.  I will certainly take it on and I will be looking at it for the new year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the work of the CL&Aacute;R programme since 2010.<\/p><p> I have to say this because the person responsible is here today: the CL&Aacute;R programme was one of the best schemes introduced for rural Ireland.  We have not had one since 2010 and I am glad that has changed.  I welcome the &euro;3 million we have got for this year.  Of course it is not enough money.  I would love to get &euro;20 million like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v got in his day, but we will not be that lucky - they were the very good times.  We do not have good times now.  Anyway, I will be back in the Department trying to get as much as possible for a CL&Aacute;R programme for next year.  I will I make my case to try to get the programme funded.  The good news is that it has been opened again.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the rural recreation fund.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's county got &euro;232,101, which was fair, out of &euro;4.5 million.  The sum related to the schemes applied for.  In the case of Kerry County Council applications, anything that was valid was grant-aided.  Last year the Department asked for submissions from local authorities.  Officials went back to some of the local authorities again this year.  Some of the local authorities had the work done in respect of the applications.  Any local authority with a scheme that was valid and that fell under the criteria got grant-aided.  We have gone back to local authorities again.  We are asking them to come in with further submissions and we will have a further round in the coming weeks.  Kerry got its fair share, as did every other county.<\/p><p> A number of parliamentary questions were tabled to me about counties that did not get funding.  I had to answer one yesterday, and I was embarrassed when answering it for the Deputy.  It would be hard for me to give money to any county that did not make an application and the county in question did not.  Another county made two applications, one of which was invalid.  I was accused by a Deputy of not giving funding for the other one but the job had been done by a local authority.  We cannot grant-aid twice.  We simply cannot do that.<\/p><p> I fully support Deputy Healy-Rae's comments on the local improvement scheme.  He is 100% right.  I want members to bring the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, before the committee and make the case.  Deputy Healy-Rae is quite correct to say that when I was in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport the scheme was abolished.  I got it back in the way that it is back now.  Anyway, I am keen for Deputy Healy-Rae to ensure that he brings the Minister before this committee.  Deputy Healy-Rae is quite correct about the people living in rural Ireland.  I understand it better than Deputy Healy-Rae.  Along with him, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and everyone else who lives in rural Ireland, I realise that the local improvement scheme is about the road up to the house or the road in and out of the main road.  People living there are as entitled to have it as anyone else.  We need to get funding put in place for it.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport needs to look at getting that scheme up and running again.  It worked well.  Deputy Healy-Rae did not make this point, but people forget that these people pay their taxes, rates, water charges and whatever they are asked to pay.  They also make a contribution towards that road as well.  The scheme worked well and I support Deputy Healy-Rae 100%.  I am asking the Deputy and this committee to bring in the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to ensure funding is put in place for that scheme for next year.<\/p><p> If a crisis begins to develop with the local improvement schemes throughout the country, it is something I can look at in the context of the CL&Aacute;R programme.  However, at the end of the day I have no wish to be doing the job of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when it comes to putting funding into roads.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, we need the CL&Aacute;R funding for many other projects in the programme that need to be subsidised and helped.  We need to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#Z00700","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

We have done a lot in a relatively short period.  None of these schemes in isolation is a silver bullet for the problems facing rural Ireland.  I am very conscious of these problems.  These schemes form part of a suite of measures to support rural communities.<\/p> <p>  The Department has commenced work on the action plan for rural development and the programme for a partnership Government contains more than 80 commitments relating to rural Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, I or the Department cannot single-handedly solve all the problems facing rural Ireland.  That is why we need a cross-Government approach.  We need joined-up thinking to ensure that all policies and initiatives are rural-proofed.  I have written to my Cabinet colleagues asking them to outline the steps their Departments will take to support rural Ireland.  It is a question of holding Ministers to account on what they are doing for rural Ireland.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, said, the Ministers need to come in to discuss the local improvement schemes.  I will hold them to account under the action plan but this committee needs to hold them to account too.  I want to see other Departments discriminate positively in favour of rural Ireland.  There are 2 million people living in rural Ireland and I am one of them.  I live in the middle of a parish in the middle of the country.  That is why the REDZ programme asks the towns to work with the hinterland.  This is not just for the towns.  There is tremendous community spirit and we need to tap into that.  That is why I am going out on regional consultations.  On Friday morning, I am going to Cavan for the first of these.  They are organised through the local authorities and I will ask different community groups for their ideas.  I do not have all the solutions.  It is a question of working with communities across the country and harnessing that energy and the commitment that I and all the rural Deputies know exists.<\/p> <p>  The action plan will be an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government.  It is the first co-ordinated approach to rural Ireland.  I believe it can make a difference and will benefit rural Ireland.  My objective is to finalise the plan for publication in November.  I will give a briefing session on the plan to Oireachtas Members in the audio visual room tomorrow.  I have written to this committee and am happy to take any of the committee members' suggestions on board because we need to work together to find solutions.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the &euro;1 million being spent on broadband, I am asking local authorities to help roll out the broadband to rural Ireland.  I have asked each local authority to appoint a broadband co-ordinator in order that when the national broadband plan is rolled out in 2017, it will not find on going into a county that there are excessive development levies to build infrastructure for broadband.  There should be no barriers to it because we need it rolled out as quickly as possible.  I am working with them to find how we can deliver short-term solutions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned Eir rolling out broadband, which is all fine and well.  I am delighted to see the company rolling something out at long last because there seemed to be a reluctance to roll anything out before the national broadband plan was mentioned.  Now it is in the procurement process and is planned for 2017.  There seems to be a sense of urgency all round now to deliver broadband.  I am very happy about that.  The Deputy also lives in rural Ireland.  When I go to make a telephone call, I am hanging out the window with the mobile phone because there is no coverage.  These matters need to be addressed.  I am glad that the commercial operators are starting to step up to the mark.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the limits on the Leader funding.  I am not familiar with that particular operating rule but I will consider it.  I do not want any rules in place that will prohibit putting together and delivering projects for the benefit of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#BB00500","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":542,"content":"<p>One of the issues in the early Leader programmes was that we got plenty of very small things but not the kind of things that would make people say 20 years on that they are fantastic.  Most of those developments need much more than &euro;1 million.

That was why the &euro;500 million for the non-commercial was set the last time.  Anybody who was dealing with the Leader programme would say that got flagship things done in counties that needed them, big and small.<\/p> <p>  I asked the Minister a core question.  There are all these nice programmes to be done with &euro;19 million because there was an underspend in Leader.

The money will be rolled out very fast because we are into the third year of a seven year plan and we need to get it going.

When one gets off an airplane in Farranfore now, one cannot get coverage but coverage was available previously.  When I got my first phone, I knew all the areas that had bad coverage at the start.  However, those areas have now got bad coverage again.  The service providers in all the areas should be tackled about this issue.  They should be told that this is what we believe is happening and that they need to enhance their service.  It is not good enough in today's world that people do not have good mobile phone coverage.  As in the case of broadband, we should have a good mobile phone coverage all over the country.<\/p> <p>  I was advised of a case a few weeks ago where a man in Scotland was knocked down by a bull but, thankfully, he was able to use his mobile phone to call for help.  Most farmers are operating on their own and they do not have any help.  A mobile phone is their only saviour to let someone know if they get into trouble.  One can get into trouble on a farm.  The same is the case for sole traders operating on their own.  A mobile phone is a necessity as it could save someone's life but he or she does not have coverage, he or she might as well throw the phone into the bin and forget about it.  I ask that the lack of coverage be tackled right away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#CC00800","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Beidh ceist dheireanach againn agus ansan cr&iacute;ochn&oacute;imid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#CC00900","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I asked a question about rural resettlement but I do not believe I got an answer.  I also asked a question about social farming.  I would make two points.  I am always worried about the terminology of the establishment and I do not mean that in a complimentary way.  The idea that people who live outside towns are in the hinterland seems to infer that we have a dependency on the great urban centres.  I know it is only a term by using it, we all buy into a concept that those of us who live outside the towns do not live in real places.  To me, the hinterland is the town and I believe I am living in the centre of the universe.  I am sure the Minister is living in rural Ireland like myself and she would think the same about this issue.  Those of us who are part of the 1.5 million living outside towns with a population of 1,500  in pure rural areas have a huge challenge to fight back collectively against the mindset that sees us as some adjunct to society but not a central part of it.  It is not as if we are a tiny minority.<\/p> <p>  That brings me on to my second issue of concern.  &Uacute;d&aacute;ras na Gaeltachta did a deal with Arramara Teoranta.  There is a confidentiality clause in it as there is with respect to the Leader programme in Meath.  We, the public representatives, cannot find out how much money the State got out of the deal with Arramara.  It seems there are two are conflicting laws here.  There is the right of the Oireachtas to information on Government income and expenditure, the details of it and whether there were good or bad deals but the new fashion everybody seems to be following, including the State which I find obnoxious, is the signing of confidentiality clauses.  I believe that no state should sign a confidentiality clause except on personal details but on financial details regarding taxpayers' money, there should be no such thing as a confidentiality clause.  If money was given to, written off or some arrangements were arrived at with Meath Partnership in respect of Leader funds, we should be privy to that.  If the State did or did not receive money from Arramara Teoranta, we should be privy to that because it is Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann's money because we, not the Government, vote all the money for expenditure and part of that is the accruals that come back in.  I feel quite agitated about this.  With every way we went about asking the simple question of how much the State got for the sale of a factory, we got the bum's rush.  With respect to every parliamentary question, direct question and media question to &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta, it refused, after the event, to tell us how much money it got for the sale of a factory.  If it signed a confidentiality agreement, that is totally wrong.  The Government should give an instruction that where State money is involved, there cannot be a confidentiality agreement around the amount of VAT money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092800002#CC01000","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1475068500,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to respond to those questions.

The increase in the aggregate budget allocation for the National Tourism Development Authority, more commonly known as F&aacute;ilte Ireland, from &euro;150 million to &euro;300 million is welcome.  Can the Minister indicate if the cumulative limit will ever be achieved given since 2012 annual Government funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland has been cut by &euro;25 million to &euro;119 million, a decrease of 17%?  This reduction in funding is a constraint on the marketing and development of our tourism sector.

The programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Lakelands brand.

As I said on the opening Stages of the Bill, it is fairly straightforward.  It allows F&aacute;ilte Ireland to expand its capital allocation, that is, the amount of money that it will be able to spend.  We are at a stage now that even on the current trajectory, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will reach its capital ceiling very soon under the current legislation, so there is a sense of urgency about the development of the brand.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the last two points Deputy Troy raised, the Lakelands brand and the deficit of skills for the hospitality industry, on Monday I chaired a meeting of the tourism action group within the Department at which these two issues were raised.  The group is representative of the stakeholders involved in tourism: hotels, tour operators, the Department, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Work on the Lakelands initiative is under way by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the chief executive is due to report to the Department on the progress that has been made.  As soon as I have that report I will share it with Deputy Troy.  This is a commitment in the programme for Government of which I am very conscious, not only Lakelands, but also that whole corridor in the country from Cavan, Monghan and east Donegal right down to the outskirts of Cork city that falls between two stools, my own county included.<\/p> <p>  There was bewilderment in some quarters about the inclusion of some parts of the country in Ireland's Ancient East and the exclusion of others.  However, it should be considered based on the mapping that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed, the series of routes and corridors that can be followed and the network of monuments and settlements, particularly as one goes further west.  Even in my county, part of south Limerick is in Ireland's Ancient East purely because some of the most important Iron Age settlements in the country are in east Limerick, not out of any wish to have this county or that county included.  A series of parameters was followed which set out where the early settlements of the Irish were once they started moving up from Wexford and Waterford, into the midlands and out to the west.  However, Deputy Troy is right that there is a commitment in the programme for Government in this regard.  We are working on it, and as soon as I get the update on it, I will provide it to him.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that our brands have proven to be hugely successful.  There was some concern at the outset about whether these would work.  However, having holidayed this year at home both on the Wild Atlantic Way and in Ireland's Ancient East and having talked to people in the industry, in hotels and restaurants and so on, they will say that there is a marked difference, particularly in the north west, in Donegal, where I was for a good chunk of the summer.  They will say that people from Limerick, Kerry and Waterford and so on are now travelling up along the north west who would never have done do before.  Similarly, while Ireland's Ancient East is probably at a much younger stage in its development, it is a different product and is being marketed and staged by F&aacute;ilte Ireland as a different product so that the two do not compete with each other but that, with the Dublin brand, A Breath of Fresh Air, they complement each other.  Deputy Troy is right in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have a big concern about the middle of the country.  However, to be honest - I know we are drifting, Chairman, and I thank you for your indulgence - local authorities have a huge role in this.  I have spoken in response to questions in the D&aacute;il as well about this element of capital grant allocations.  It is within the remit of local authorities, if they want to get specific projects done, to apply for the large capital allocations, the grants system disclosed recently.  Local authorities have it within their ambit to apply for that.  To give the committee a case in point in my area, between Limerick and Clare, the Shannon Estuary is not included in the Wild Atlantic Way.  However, the Limerick City and County Manager, with his Clare colleague, is considering the development of a route specifically for the Shannon Estuary that will not be branded the Wild Atlantic Way but will for all intents and purposes attract people off it.  Local authorities therefore have a big role in this as well.  Under the new Local Government Act, it is not that they can or that they might look at tourism as an economic driver; the Act says very clearly they must look at it.  The regional action plans for jobs state the same thing.  The City and County Managers Association sits on that tourism action group as well, and I have been very clear with the city and county managers that there are targets in the regional action plans for jobs and the tourism strategy in terms of people, place and policy that they have to get to, for example,  even as basic an issue as making sure that local authorities have it within their grasp to have a tourism development officer.<\/p> <p>  I have answered questions in the D&aacute;il about tourism offices.  There are local area offices in Westmeath County Council, Longford County Council and every small- and medium-sized town in the country.  Now that the Local Government Act has been amended and local authorities have a tourism role, there is nothing to prevent local authorities taking on the role of providing information in their areas from a tourism point of view.  They are now empowered under the legislation to do so, therefore, it is not all about F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there is a gap in the market, and that gap has been driven by the fact that the other two areas have been so successful.  That is the stimulus for me as the Minister with responsibility for tourism, to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to say that the targets that we have for capital funding are ambitious and we want to drive them forward.  That is why the cumulative amount of the capital investment plan is &euro;5.6 million for F&aacute;ilte Ireland for 2016-21 and &euro;125 million for the Tourism Development Project by 2022.  The targets originally set out in 2003 and amended in 2011 have already been reached, so while we are here to amend legislation to allow the ceiling to be increased so that F&aacute;ilte Ireland can deliver the work that they need to deliver, we should not restrain ourselves or be less ambitious.  Deputy Troy is right that between 2012 and now, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has taken a fair whacking.  However, by the same token it has delivered some huge projects in that time.  I would see this legislation as empowering F&aacute;ilte Ireland to tell the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that over the last number of years, in the worst possible days of the economy, it still delivered some key pieces of critical capital infrastructure.  The legislation is now amended.  We have capital allowances.  However, I would not say to F&aacute;ilte Ireland that it must be restricted within five years to do meet its target.  If it reaches its target within two and a half or three years, I - and whoever my successor is - would be delighted to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland coming back again and to amend the legislation again.<\/p> <p>  Regarding culinary skills, again, this came up at the tourism leadership group on Monday.  A piece of work specifically regarding chefs has already been carried out because the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the people who are involved in it will all say there is a shortage of chefs and that is a big problem.  However, there is a model that is working and, again, local authorities have a big role to play in this if they want to, as well as through the education and training boards.  As a case in point, in my area, in Limerick, the Limerick and Clare education and training board has taken it upon itself to look at the skills shortages in the regional action plan for jobs between the hotels and restaurants industry and is prepared to fill them.  I agree with the Deputy in this regard.  We do not need to go back down the road of establishing another agency to look at this.  I think Solas, through the national apprenticeship programme, which is working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to make sure that such a skill set is met, is the right agency to do this.<\/p> <p>  In each of the regions where the regional action plan for jobs has been identified, there is a requirement to identify the skills shortages.  Culinary skills is a very clear one, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, with the Department and the groups that are involved in the tourism action group, is in the process of finishing that work with Solas.  I imagine that we will see progress there but, again, there is a model there which works.  Education and training boards at a local level can do this.  We have several colleges of catering and hotel management across the country as well that have excellent students.  However, I agree that now that the industry is beginning to expand at an astronomical rate - it really is, here in Dublin particularly - we need good people and we need to be able to provide opportunities for our own people here at home to take up the jobs that are being created.  I will provide the Deputy with a full update on the two issues that he raised from the tourism action group and to Deputies O'Keeffe and Munster and the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#B00100","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I would like to make a comment, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#B00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>We are sticking to section 1.

Ireland's Ancient East is starting to take off but has not yet reached its full potential.  We also have the midlands region, which has been left out.  It is like the doughnut effect and there is nothing in the middle.  What targeted plans are included to bring other areas up to the same level as the Wild Atlantic Way, in particular Ireland's Ancient East?  The Minister of State said F&aacute;ilte Ireland has targeted specific products from Wexford to Wicklow and has plans, but there are other areas of equal importance which perhaps have not received the same promotion or been given the same opportunities as others.

If there is an onus on them to promote tourism in their areas and it is something they must do, will funding be made available so they have the tools and are unable to state no funding is available or they have staff shortages and do not have the manpower to promote somebody?  If we are to have a six-year plan, it is important that all of the ducks are in a row and local authorities are provided with the facilities and are not on the back foot from the get go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#C00500","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I welcome the proposal to raise the ceiling, but I hope it is more than just an aspiration and that extra money will be allocated.  I hope the Minister of State impresses this on the Minister for Finance.  We all welcome the work done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in promoting this country as a destination and a place to travel.  It is ironic that some of the advertisements show a few locals in their local pub, perhaps with some music or having a bit of chat.  Is there anything the Minister of State can do under his tourism remit to help make local pubs sustainable?  There is no point in promoting an item that might not be there in another decade.  Day in, day out we hear of pubs closing.  I am a regular traveller to Listowel for the races and writers' week.  A number of pubs there have closed in the past ten years.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland highlights the atmosphere, camaraderie and friendship of the local pub.  If will lose this we will lose tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#C00600","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I also thank the Chairman for his leniency with regard to what is being discussed.  The Minister of State spoke about the fact we have many centres of excellence, predominantly in our institutes of technology, which run courses in hotel and catering.  We still have a chronic shortage at present.  This is why I have referenced CERT in the past.  We did not have this chronic shortage but we do now.  Do the institutes of technology have the capacity to deal with it?  Has an audit been carried out to see whether they have the capacity?  If they do not, where will we meet our capacity?  This has the potential to strangle tourism growth.<\/p> <p>  We have had a phenomenal number of years of increased tourism to the country.  The Wild Atlantic Way was very good and built on from The Gathering a number of years ago, which was another very good initiative.  We have also been very fortunate from the point of view that the euro has been weak against the US dollar and the English pound, which are factors outside of our control.  In light of the fact that Brexit will soon be a reality and that sterling has decreased in value, what actions will the Department undertake to ensure that we can meet and surmount these challenges?  I do not for a minute suggest that all our tourism is based on cost, but it is a factor.  Unfortunately, we have also noticed in recent years that hotels and restaurants have started to push their prices back up.  We want to ensure we will remain competitive because this is key when people make a decision on where to go on holiday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#C00700","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Munster for her support for the Bill.  There is no actual allocation of money in the Bill.  It sets out a parameter and ceiling that will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland to draw down funding from the Exchequer over a period of two, three, four or five years.  The legislation will have to be amended in future.  To a degree, this is a good thing but it is also onerous.  Not all State agencies must operate under this process, which makes matters quite difficult for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  However, as ceilings are approached and reached, the legislation must be amended again.  The process must go from here to Report Stage and back to the Seanad.  There is a bit of time involved.<\/p> <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is in the process of rolling out its large capital allocations.  Its smaller capital allocations will be rolled out over a period.  It does this on an ongoing basis at arm's length from the Department.  While F&aacute;ilte Ireland is statutory agency, it is independent of the Government and operates on that basis.  Obviously, it follows the policy of the Department on the initiatives we want to pursue, such as Ireland's Ancient East, the midlands, the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air.  Its role also extends to being the promotional authority in Great Britain, by virtue of the fact that Tourism Ireland is not a capital agency.  Its remit was established, as a North-South body, under the Good Friday Agreement.  Its role is to promote the island of Ireland.  In recent months, I have been hugely impressed with the programme of work done by Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in response to a number of threats that exist, which Deputy Troy mentioned.  As recently as this week, representatives of Tourism Ireland are in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the Middle East - they will also go to the Far East - to promote the island of Ireland, North and South.<\/p> <p>  There are problems looming.  It is great that there are problems because the fact that they exist and that there are capacity issues shows there is growth in the industry.<\/p><p>It also makes my job easier in attracting Department of Public Expenditure and Reform money into the industry.<br\/><br\/>Deputies Munster and Troy alluded to the difficulty with languages.  Forty thousand people from China visited the island of Ireland last year.  We have a major problem with attracting Chinese guides, namely, people with fluency in Chinese, or with doing even as basic a thing as providing Chinese interpretative boards or audio sets in some of our larger visitor attractions.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's large and small capital grant allocations will allow visitor attractions to do that.  Approximately 200 of the guides operating in Ireland are predominantly based in the UK.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is considering bringing them together so as to ensure that they are up to speed with Chinese when giving out information.  It is important that we get the right message out.  We do not want a message that is simply taken from Wikipedia, a travel guide or so on.  This is a challenge for us as a small country.<br\/><br\/>Brexit presents other challenges, for example, with the visa entry scheme.  The Department of Justice and Equality, which is the responsible Government agency, is working on this issue.  Brexit is a major issue, as is the value of sterling.  If people from abroad who are considering holidaying in Ireland are curious visitors, the types who are interested in heritage, the arts, walking, trails and so on, will they instead consider Scotland?  A large proportion of visitors to the island of Ireland are from Great Britain and the value of sterling is something that they will have to take into consideration, no more than any of the rest of us would do as regards the currency in our own pockets were we going on holiday.  In this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have submitted a strong request, one that I support, as part of the Estimates process to the effect that our overseas marketing budgets be increased because now is not the time to regress.  Rather, it is the time to drive our marketing on.<br\/><br\/>There is also a call to the commercial sector.  On Monday night, I launched a drive by the Dublin tourism interest groups, which comprise F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the four local authorities that have invested in it and the commercial sector.  The commercial sector is a significant beneficiary of the upturn in the tourism industry, particularly in Dublin.  Regarding what is happening in Dublin, I am on record as saying that I have major concerns about capacity in the first instance, but also competitiveness.  What happens in Dublin has a trickle-down effect in Deputy Munster's constituency of Louth, Mitchelstown in Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency and Mullingar in Deputy Troy's constituency.  Undoubtedly, there are problems.  There is capacity, but one cannot magic up hotel rooms.  They will not just fall off the back of a ship down at the docks.  Planning, financing and construction take time.  Many will remember how, not that long ago in 2011 when I first came to the D&aacute;il, tumbleweeds were blowing through hotels in this city.  Nothing was happening here.  All of a sudden five years later, hotels are full.<br\/><br\/>While that is great, we must ensure that the temptation to take the road of using the last 10% or 20% of rooms to drive up prices and take the customer for a ride is avoided.  If it is not, then there will be reputational damage and we will be back to where we were in 2004 to 2006 when we were anti-competitive.  I will make a point to the committee, and I am sure that all of the members will agree - the industry has a responsibility here, as does the Government and the Oireachtas.  We all must play our roles.  The proof of the pudding is that the Government has put its cards on the table in four successive years in terms of the VAT rate, the capital investment that we have allowed for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the allocations that we have made to Tourism Ireland on a North-South basis, as Deputy Munster mentioned.  In response, we expect people to act responsibly, including by maintaining a competitive advantage and not giving in to the temptation to drive up prices through comparisons with large cities like Madrid and Barcelona.  Dublin is not Madrid or Barcelona.  That message must be clear.  It is a significant player in the European tourism market and is competitive currently, so we must not lose that competitiveness.  Along with issue of Brexit, which Deputy Troy mentioned, this is a singular threat.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Munster discussed oversight.  There is oversight of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I will engage with this committee on a regular basis and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also appear before it.  Its annual accounts and reports are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While this legislation makes it difficult for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to work, it adds to the level of accountability and oversight applied to that body.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also announce an agreed capital plan on an annual basis.  Importantly, it is held to account by me and the Department in the first instance but also by the Oireachtas.  As the committee sets out in its work, it would also be important for members to meet F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland regularly and hold them to account for the initiatives and projects to which they have committed.  In the same way, I hope that my engagement with the committee, albeit on narrow legislation today, would be extended.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the funding that is available to local authorities.  I was a councillor between 2003 and 2011.  Since that time, many of the responsibilities that local authorities had have been taken away from them.  These include third level grants, water and the centralisation of certain housing functions, for example, the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Local authorities now have an opportunity.  Some have been to the fore in this regard.  Recently, I met the Cork county manager.  His plan for Cork County Council is superb.  There will be no additional staffing.  Instead, existing staff will be upskilled and allowed to drive forward.  Consider what Waterford City and County Council is doing with greenways or what Deputy Troy's local authority in Westmeath is doing with Belvedere House and Gardens.  The Chairman's local authority is working on greenways in north and south Kerry.  As to my own area, Limerick City and County Council has a tourism officer for the first time.  The officer is an existing staff member whom the council, after the person changed positions, has taken the opportunity to upskill.<br\/><br\/>Every county has a Leader partnership or local development company.  Those groups have a role to play as well.  My county has established an <i>ad hoc<\/i>tourism development committee, for want of a better word, comprising the local development companies Ballyhoura Development and West Limerick Resources, Limerick City and County Council and the Shannon Group.  There is no reason for every other local authority in the country not to do likewise.  I expect councils to do this.  If there are blockages in State agencies, be it F&aacute;ilte Ireland or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, councils will have the opportunity through Oireachtas Members and local authority members to meet me and discuss their plans for their respective areas, as I am only too delighted to meet local authority members to discuss those.  If there are blockages, I would like to hear about them.<br\/><br\/>I will not say that city and county managers might be able to do this.  Instead, they should be doing it.  Every city and county manager should have a member of senior staff who is taking responsibility for this issue because it forms part of the country's economic development.  Tourism is no longer something that is restricted to the Chairman's constituency where one can take a jaunting car around the lakes of Killarney in a b&aacute;n&iacute;n jumper.  That day is gone.  Tourism now is a real industry in every part of the country for real people who have real jobs with real mortgages and who rear real children.  It is no longer acceptable that local authorities might not play their part.  I have asked my departmental officials to conduct an audit of local authorities to determine how they stand on this matter.  Authorities are required to do this under the Local Government Act and the Action Plan for Jobs.<br\/><br\/>There is no funding issue.  Unlike when I was a member of a local authority and for the first time, local authorities now have access to their own funding.  They have discretion that they never had previously.  If they believe that it is in their interests to drive their local economies, they will rise to the challenge.  If they do not, then it is for councillors to hold them to account.<br\/><br\/>I would say the same of tourism offices.  Every town has a local authority office.  There is no need for us to build more.  Instead, we should find out where there are empty spaces, be those in Dublin, Ballinasloe or wherever.<\/p><p>Those local authority buildings must be used for purposes other than just the traditional local authority services.  Tourism is now a traditional local authority service and must be viewed as that.  Local authorities must open themselves up to that and some, in fairness, are doing an excellent job.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Keeffe asked if this is an aspiration or a reality.  That we are here amending the legislation so soon after the last time demonstrates this is more than an aspiration.  I have no doubt the legislation will have to be amended again in the short term.  It will depend on how much the economy expands and the more money F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I can get, the more we will be able to spend on places like Doneraile Court, which I visited recently.  It is a fabulous addition to the Deputy's constituency that is funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Ballyhoura.  It is a great asset for east Cork.  There are similar projects on Spike Island and in Youghal.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the local pub and he has a willing ally here anyway.  I am not in any way ashamed that my brother and family members are publicans.  I see that a very important part of the licensed trade is the development of the tourism industry.  In fairness to the trade, it has been blamed for many of the social ills in the country and wrongly so in many cases.  Most publicans are very responsible and have much to offer.  The largest visitor attraction in this city is the Guinness Storehouse, which proves there is a strong attachment between the food and beverage industry and the tourism product.  We do not need to apologise for that.  Most publicans are responsible and have a role to play in the tourism industry.  I was in Dunmore East in Waterford last week and I had a fabulous day there.  The finest bowl of chowder I got was in a pub in Dunmore East.  Such facilities offer a very important part of a package, and without them, we could not deliver the package.  The Deputy is correct that the attractiveness would not be there either.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy mentioned the institutes of technology and skill sets.  As I indicated a while ago, SOLAS is charged with making sure those skills exist and the tourism action group has identified chefs as an issue in the first instance, although there are also issues with front of house and waiting staff in restaurants.  We want to ensure people in the first instance have an opportunity through the tourism industry to get a good job, build a career, upskill and have the opportunity to have a mortgage and rear a family in the local community.  It is an indigenous industry like agriculture.<\/p><p> I am not in favour of the establishment of another agency or anything like that but F&aacute;ilte Ireland, SOLAS and my Department can work together with the industry to see where there are shortages.  The relationship with the institutes of technology and education and training boards is critical.  There is already a precedent in the facility for Limerick and Clare, which is providing the next generation of staff for hotels in Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary, Offaly and elsewhere in three-star, four-star and five-star accommodation, as well as restaurants.  This Bill is part of a suite of measures taken to shore up the industry, including the measures relating to the travel tax, the VAT rate, the separation of Shannon Airport and the development of brands.  These were done when tourism was on its knees but it is now flying.  Nevertheless, we must spread the benefits across the country.<\/p><p> I will speak about risks.  My county is affected by the lack of a brand down the middle of the country and there is a danger from \"overbranding\".  Just as there cannot be an accident and emergency department at every crossroads, one cannot have a brand at every crossroads.  We must be very careful.  Australia is many times the size of Ireland and has one brand in the Great Ocean Road.  We must not dilute the value of the brands that we have.  Nevertheless, the corridor from the Finn Valley in Donegal to the outskirts of Cork City, Coachford and Blarney is an area that concerns me and the Department.  That is why the city and county managers have been asked to formulate a strategy with the local development companies in the first instance.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is looking at a brand.  It will be very difficult to keep all the balls in the air while ensuring every townland in the country is included in a brand.  We do not wish to overbrand because the message will get lost, which would be worse than having no brand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#C00800","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475055000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#E00250","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475055000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1475055000,"counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#E00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1475055000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has completed its consideration of the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2015 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016092800002#E00400","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475055000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 11.15 a.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
