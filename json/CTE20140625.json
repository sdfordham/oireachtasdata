I am pleased to avail of this opportunity to speak to the committee about the primary schools for which the archdiocese of Dublin has responsibility, and to outline plans for the reconfiguration of schools which may result in their opening, closure or amalgamation.  Today we will discuss schools at primary level only.<\/p><p>  This is an historic time in education in Dublin and the other counties of the archdiocese.  The educational specialists in the diocesan education secretariat are leading significant change.  Co-education in schools has been mandated by the State since the 1980s.  The archdiocese is making important progress in the amalgamation of girls and boys primary schools into co-educational Catholic schools.  Five amalgamations, involving ten schools, have been organised over the past two years.  At present 15 schools are involved in negotiations which could lead to nine new schools being established.<\/p> <p>Where Catholic schools have amalgamated, they have adapted well despite the significant change involved.  Considerable credit is due to the pupils, parents and staff for their commitment.  The archdiocese of Dublin is committed to pluralism in educational provision.<\/p><p> I will define two terms.  First, and as members are probably aware, \"patron\" is defined in section 8 of the Education Act 1998 as the person who requests recognition of a primary school from the Department of Education and Skills.  He or she is then recognised by the Minister as the patron of the school.  In the case of Catholic primary schools, the bishop of the diocese is the patron.  The situation is the same for the Church of Ireland.  In the case of an education and training board, ETB, its committee is the patron of its new community national schools.  In the case of Educate Together, its company is the patron.  Some individuals are patrons.  Any of us present could apply to be a patron if we wanted to.  The Department holds a register of all patrons.  When I come to discuss alternative patronages, I will be referring to patronages other than Catholic ones.<\/p><p> Second, \"trustees\" are the owners of a school.  If the school property is owned by the local parish, in other words, it is essentially owned by the diocese, then the archbishop is the trustee as well as the patron.  The local parish priest in his role acts as trustee.  Sometimes, the primary school property is owned by a religious order, which is occasionally called a congregation.  The congregation is the trustee in that case, with the archbishop as the patron.  At post-primary level, the situation is different.  The terms \"trustee\" and \"patron\" are interchangeable under the Education Act.<\/p><p> For well over a century, the archdiocese of Dublin has been involved in primary education.  A number of schools that were set up 150 years ago are still in existence.  In its role as patron of schools, the archdiocese has an obligation to plan for, evaluate and review on an ongoing basis its provision of schools.  It is not the responsibility of the church to be a provider of education for all children, but the church, as part of its mission, is committed to providing Catholic education for those parents who want it for their children.  As such, we have embarked on an ongoing and systematic reorganisation of the 466 primary schools in the archdiocese of Dublin.<\/p><p> In reviewing the provision of Catholic education in any particular parish, reorganisation or amalgamation of existing schools under Catholic patronage might be appropriate for any or all of the following considerations.  The first is demographics.  The recent census showed a population decline in a number of areas in the archdiocese, which has been evident to us in the falling enrolment figures in schools in those areas, for example, parts of Ballyfermot, Cabra, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Greenhills and Walkinstown.  Schools that traditionally were large now have empty classrooms.  There is an instance of a school building that opened in 1951 with three separate schools.  These amalgamated into two schools in 1982 and into one school two years ago because of falling numbers.  These large buildings still need to be maintained, insured, repaired, heated and cleaned.<\/p><p> Second, education is a consideration.  It is not good for the dynamics of a school or for staff morale to see pupil numbers dwindling and classrooms emptying year by year.<\/p><p> Third, co-education is a consideration.  There are schools that have co-education from infants up to first class but where the boys subsequently move for second class to an all-boys senior school while the girls remain in an all-girls senior school.  An increasing number of boys' parents are requesting that the boys remain with their classmates in their original schools.  Indeed, there is a growing demand from parents for co-education.  The forum report to the new schools establishment group, with which the committee is familiar, stated: \"There was a widespread demand for co-educational schooling across almost all areas.\"  It is the policy of the Department of Education and Skills that all new primary schools be co-educational.  All primary schools that have been opened since the 1980s are co-educational.  Parents do not get any choice in the matter.<\/p><p> Fourth, divesting is a consideration.  There is a need to provide for alternative patronage.  This is not a retreat from the tradition of providing Catholic education.  Rather, it is a recognition of the beginnings of a new presence.  Catholic education still has its vital place in our education system as something that brings a unique value system, one that is recognised by families of a variety of religious traditions who opt to send their children to Catholic schools.  At the same time, as Catholic educators we welcome the fact that there should be other schools that embrace a different ethos and will contribute in their way to the rightful pluralism of educational provision in today's Ireland.<\/p><p> In newly developing areas, the Department of Education and Skills provides for alternative patronage by offering new schools to other patron bodies.  In areas of stable demographics, the level of demand for change of patronage still has to be fully ascertained.  Many parents are anxious about proposed changes.  While we are confident about the future of Catholic education, pluralism in schooling is something that the archdiocese welcomes.  As Archbishop Martin stated, however, pluralism in this regard will have to be measured not just in the provision of schools, but in an outcome in which every school, independent of its patronage, becomes a place of welcome for the deprived, the marginalised and those with educational challenges.  Pluralism should not give rise to elitism or social division.<\/p><p> A final consideration is finance.  Schools that are losing numbers are experiencing financial difficulty.  Based on the number of pupils attending a school, the Department pays it a capitation grant each year for its running.  One school that we are aware of received a capitation grant of &euro;49,000 and spent &euro;30,000 of it on heat and light because of the size of the building, leaving just &euro;19,000 to pay for insurance and meet other bills.  During the past two financial years, some schools have been overspending from their reserves.  A number have come to the patron in distress because they have run out of money.  From our research, it appears that, in two years' time, a significant percentage of schools will not be able to exist financially based on current departmental funding.<\/p><p> What is the process of reorganisation?  There are two forms of amalgamation of schools.  One arises from a perceived need at local level.  In the other case, the proposal to reorganise schools comes from the diocese or trustees for one or more of the reasons I have mentioned.  A sequence of steps takes place.  As a first step, discussions always take place with the trustees of the schools involved in order to explore the idea.  The next step in the process involves the chairpersons of the boards of management and the principals of the schools.  This is a critical part of our consultation process.  Research is carried out on aspects of the schools, including pupil numbers over a period of years, future demographic projections for the area, educational viability, accommodation and consequent financial sustainability.  If there is a viable proposal, it is brought to the boards of management for consultation.  These boards are composed of all of the stakeholders of the school community, namely, nominees of the parents, of the teachers, of the local community and of the patron.<\/p> <p><font color=\"#212100\">Following agreement among the boards of management it is then brought to the staff of the schools and to the parent body for consultation.  This is the structure in place and process followed.<\/font><br\/><font color=\"#212100\"> On employment issues, there is agreement between unions and management regarding teacher employment.  No teacher loses his or her job.  Legislation governs the deployment of the other staff of the school.  We have a project team of ten retired principal teachers and Department inspectors who are called in to work as facilitators with schools during an amalgamation.  These are people whose expertise is available and called upon by school communities.  There is no change in the pupil-teacher ratio, which is set by the Department of Education and Skills and the security of children with special needs is always guaranteed.<\/font><br\/><b><font color=\"#212100\"> <\/font><\/b><font color=\"#212100\">On our experience to date, successful reorganisations are those where all of the stakeholders contribute to and respect the process.  It has happened that the process was frustrated where information was disclosed at an inappropriate stage.  In a small number of cases staff do not see the need to address the situation and have on occasion because of their fear of change engaged in providing misinformation, causing parents to believe that any change would worsen conditions for pupils and staff.  This has caused unnecessary distress to communities.  In our experience where there is willingness on the part of the principal and teachers to engage with the process, other stakeholders are reassured and support the proposed reorganisation.  It is understandable, in a number of cases, that staff might be opposed to the reorganisation of schools in case it results in a loss of resources, ancillary staff and grants.  The officials of the Department of Education and Skills are working hard with us to address this matter.  Discussions are ongoing in order to resolve this issue and it is hoped that there will be some progress to report in the near future.<\/font><br\/><font color=\"#212100\"> If there is disagreement among the stakeholders regarding the reorganisation of the schools, the issue reverts to the boards of management and then to the patron for resolution.  The decision to reorganise or amalgamate a school rests with the patron.  It is then proposed to the Minister for Education and Skills for approval.  The patron has a responsibility under the Education Act to manage schools effectively.  It is a complex process.  Most amalgamations are managed very successfully and result in dynamic new schools.  Over the past two years ten schools were reorganised with great success.  I could speak to the committee about any one of those reorganisations.  I recall attending the opening of the newly amalgamated St. James's school in Basin Lane.  I wish members could have seen the positivity, excitement and energy of the parents, staff, pupils and the community as a whole.  One could almost touch it.  This was the result of the amalgamation of two great schools into one new vibrant school.  It is an example for all.  The patron seeks to effect all restructuring as collaboratively as possible, with a view to achieving the best outcome and causing as little disturbance as is feasible to any community because the vision which drives this plan for the reorganisation of schools is the greater good of all of the pupils, their parents and teachers.<\/font><br\/>I will conclude by reminding members of our vision and approach.  <font color=\"#212100\">The Archdiocese of Dublin is committed to providing Catholic schools for those parents who want a Catholic education for their children.  It supports a plurality of patronage and the amalgamation of schools in areas of declining pupil numbers as this will ensure the survival of vibrant Catholic schools into the future. Also amalgamation of schools will provide the option of co-education for parents and their<\/font><font color=\"#212100\">children in Irish education into the future.<\/font><font color=\"#212100\">To be successful, this re-imagining of education provision in Ireland requires the support of parents, teachers, communities and local and national representatives.<\/font><br\/><font color=\"#212100\"> I thank members for their attention.  Their commitment and support is important to us.  If there is anything at local level that they can do to assist us in our work to improve education at primary level in our Catholic schools it will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500003#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500005#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms McDonagh and her colleagues to the meeting.  I am sure there are many specific issues which members wish to raise with Ms McDonagh today.<br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  Ms McDonagh indicated that there are 15 schools currently in discussions with regard to amalgamations and that this process could lead to nine new schools.  In regard to the 466 primary schools in the archdiocese, what discussions have taken place between the archdiocese and the Minister for Education and Skills or his officials in relation to a change of patronage.  While I am aware there are a number of proposals in this regard nationally perhaps Ms McDonagh would update the committee on the situation in this regard within the archdiocese.  <\/font><br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  Ms McDonagh indicated that there is often resistance within a school to amalgamation.  In regard to parents and communities, while there may be one or two parents on a school board of management it would appear that the involvement of other parents and communities only occurs later in the process, perhaps when proposals have been developed and serious consideration has been given to how to proceed.  Perhaps Ms McDonagh would comment on whether it would make more sense to ensure that parents and communities are involved in the process at an earlier stage.<\/font><br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  Ms McDonagh referenced that her research would indicate that a percentage of schools will not be able to exist financially beyond two years from now, which is serious.  Perhaps she would elaborate on the percentage of schools in this regard and on whether the schools involved are small schools or schools housed in larger buildings which now accommodate fewer pupils.  She might also elaborate from the archdiocese point of view on the dynamic behind why so many schools are finding it difficult to sustain themselves financially.  I can hazard a guess that one reason will be the significant cuts in funding but would welcome Ms McDonagh's elaboration on the financial pressures facing many schools and how many of them in her view will not be in a position to fund themselves after the next two years.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500005#F00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am aware of St. James's school in Basin Lane.  Amalgamation has worked well in that instance.  In other instances, amalgamations are often resisted on the basis that the logic behind the proposals are not explained to the community or parents.  Sometimes, the resistance comes from parents and other times it is from the teachers.  The amalgamation with which I am most familiar is the proposed amalgamation in September 2015 of four schools in Ballyfermot into one school.  Ms McDonagh referred earlier to 15 schools possibly becoming nine schools following amalgamations.  If one removes the four schools about which I am speaking then taking Ms McDonagh's figures 11 schools will become eight schools, which does not suggest an amalgamation in the case of many of the other schools.  The figures do not add up in terms of amalgamations.<br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  In Ballyfermot there are two campuses located back to back.  The proposal appears to be illogical.  Ms McDonagh referred to a falloff in the population in Ballyfermot.  However, the census report suggests the opposite.  The reason for the fall in pupil numbers in the De La Salle primary school was the opening in the same catchment area less than ten years ago of St. Ultan's primary school, which is operating at capacity.<\/font><\/p> <p>The Gaelscoileanna in the vicinity, which also draw pupils from Ballyfermot, are run at capacity with large waiting lists.  Next year there will potentially be an increase in numbers for Ballyfermot schools.  That is not the core point, which is the logic behind the closing of the De La Salle campus, shifting pupils from one very large campus to a more restricted campus which already has prefabricated buildings on it.  It defeats any logic.<br\/>There are several schools involved and they come under the patronage of the Archbishop and the proposals made by the delegation.  What is the proposal for the De La Salle campus if this goes ahead?  Much State money has been invested in a degree of modernisation of the De La Salle campus, and the Sonas autism unit was also operating well.  What will happen to it and other centres in the De La Salle complex?  What will happen to the playground in the Dominican campus if new buildings must be created for a physical education hall and facilitation of the autism centre's transfer?  Extra classrooms will also be required if the schools are to be amalgamated, so are there plans to dispose of the De La Salle lands, including the playing fields and buildings?  Will they be retained for other community or educational purposes that may add to the campus?<br\/>I am not opposed to the amalgamation <i>per se<\/i>if both campuses are retained and the existing capacity is used correctly.  The more educational space available to a community which has suffered much disadvantage over the years, the better for that community in future.  There have been problems with how the amalgamation has been presented to parents.  The delegation has mentioned stakeholders, and the orders and patrons seem to have been able to communicate the matters among themselves, but that has not filtered out as accurately as it should have to stakeholders.  They were originally told last November that the school was to close in September this year, but by raising the issue, it seems the process has been delayed for a year.  Only yesterday the De La Salle brothers sent home with all the boys a note stating that primary education in Ballyfermot is being reorganised by the patron because of declining numbers of pupils in the school, with all Catholic primary schools being located on the former Dominican site after 31 August 2015.  It stated that the De La Salle campus would no longer be used as a primary school and that the planned restructuring was designed to ensure continued high-quality education into the future for all the children in Ballyfermot.  Nothing said by me or the delegation contradicts the statement, but it seems illogical.<br\/>There is another key point.  Has the patron been in full consultation with one of the primary stakeholders - the Department of Education and Skills - about its plans, and how far back they were initiated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500005#F00400","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403699100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I join the members in welcoming our visitors, and I thank them for the presentation.  My c&uacute;pla focail will be somewhat short, as I too wanted to raise the Ballyfermot issue, and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh dealt with it in a very comprehensive way.  My attention was drawn to this as somebody who happens to be a past pupil of the De La Salle and Dominican schools in Ballyfermot.  It seems the De La Salle brothers have handled the issue in a way with which we cannot be altogether happy.  It is my understanding that until the statement came out yesterday, they were silent on this particular issue, which has been less than helpful.  It has created an atmosphere of consternation, in effect, among many parents.<\/p><p>  Another issue is the inclusion of the facilities on the Dominican campus.

I have some experience of the matter under discussion and I met Ms McDonagh at her office.  I have also exchanged telephone calls, letters and so on.  What struck me in my first interface with the archdiocese was rather different from what I am hearing today.  I remember making the statement that parents must be the primary partners in the education process, and the impression I got from the outset was that if parents are the primary partners, they must be brought on board at the very beginning and consulted, and their views must be taken on board so as to be factored into any decisions.  I did not get that impression, but rather the idea that parents would be told when a decision was made by the archdiocese.  Essentially, they would be factored out of the negotiations.  Parents in Ballyfermot never gave me the impression that they were being consulted from an early stage or that they understood the rationale and reason behind this.  There has been enormous confusion, anger and worry among parents.  No parent wants any undue interference in the education of children, particularly when they are doing well.<\/p><p>  The archdiocese proposes the amalgamation of four schools into two schools.  The outlandish dimension is that among those four schools, the best is the De La Salle school.  Architecturally it is one of the finest school buildings in Dublin city, and it has one of the finest campuses, as it is spacious and ample, with football pitches and sporting facilities for young, energetic people to run around.  These are critical in the development of children.  It also has enormous resources inside the buildings, and parents have worked tirelessly over generations with the principal and staff to build these so that the needs of children would be met.  Nevertheless, the proposal is to put an end to this school, despite its being one of the anchors of education in Ballyfermot.<\/p> <p>It is a disgrace that someone sitting in Archbishop's House could make that decision against the profound sentiments and wishes of parents, and wishes of the whole community.  It does not make any sense.  If one must amalgamate and reconfigure, surely one keeps the strongest cards, one keeps the best buildings, one keeps the buildings with the best traditions, best resources and the best facilities.  That, I think, is logical.  What is being proposed here is that the best is being excluded and four schools are being pushed into a campus in which one can barely swing a cat.  It is an outlandish proposal.

In Ballyfermot information was released at an inappropriate stage and the first I knew of it was when I got telephone calls from very worried parents.  They thought that their children were going to end up in large classes, and be separated from their friends.  That happened before the boards of management got a chance to call the meeting and talk to parents about this matter, and exactly as the Deputy said, to discuss with parents the rationale and talk to them about the thinking behind it.  The people in Ballyfermot - before the Archbishop's House ever heard about any re-organisation - the educational leaders in Ballyfermot got together.  Therefore, the chairpersons of five schools, as there were at the time in 2008, met and employed a facilitator to talk about the future of education in Ballyfermot because they themselves decided that there were too many schools for the number of children.  The chairpersons in the first instance met the facilitators.  The first I heard of it was when I was asked whether I would come to a meeting where the principals would attend with a facilitator.  These talks go back as far as that time.  It was at local level that all this talk was going on because they had decided the schools were far too big for the number of pupils that were around.  That is how the whole situation works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500007#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1403699700,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I live in lower Ballyfermot and taught for 33 years.

Fr. Michael O'Kelly was the parish priest at the time.  He employed the facilitator and that was the first I knew about the matter.  He invited me to a meeting one night at 7.30 p.m., in the dark, and I got lost on my way out to the schools.  That was my first visit there and it was in 2008.  One of the chairpersons of the schools told me that they were talking about this since the late 1990s, which was said at one of the meetings lately.  The meetings I know about started in 2008.  That is where the talks started - at local level.<\/p><p>  Generally, when I have spoken about any of the successful amalgamations in the past few years I have outlined the steps involved.  Parents are called in.  All of the rationale behind the thinking that is going on is explained to the parents.  Before that happened in Ballyfermot somebody released information at an inappropriate time and, as a result, parents telephoned me and were very upset.  I am a parent of children and I would not be happy if information came home from my school in the way it happened in Ballyfermot.  It is no wonder the parents were upset.  They did not know what was going on or the rationale behind it.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Conaghan mentioned the campus in De La Salle.  He is correct that it is an outstanding campus.  I do not know whether everyone has seen it but it is beautiful.  It has a fabulous building and terrific grounds.  The Deputy wondered why one school was chosen rather than the other.  The archdiocese of Dublin does not own the De La Salle campus.  It owns the Dominican campus because the Dominican congregation handed its schools over to the archdiocese, as have a number of congregations.  Over the years a number of congregations have come to us and said that because they are getting older and there are fewer of them they cannot manage and they have handed over to the archdiocese.  The Dominican Order did that a number of years ago.  Therefore, the Ballyfermot parish owns the Dominican site and the De La Salle Brothers own the other site.<\/p><p>  Let us look at the rationale.  I have figures for repair bills.  Three years ago the repair bill for the De La Salle building was &euro;70,000, the repair bill two years ago was &euro;63,000 and the repair bill in the year 2012-13 was &euro;70,000.  That is a total spend of &euro;203,000 in three years which is unrecoverable and there is no grant available from the Department of Education and Skills.  The building has a copper roof and &euro;30,000 of the expenditure was to do with the roof.  Earlier, I gave heating and lighting costs for the school as an example.  The size of the building means it is unsustainable.  In an ideal world a philanthropist would pay for all that work but the State will not do so.  Those are the facts of the matter.<\/p><p>  The number of children at the moment means the grants will not pay for two campuses.  We got the Department to appoint an architect - a departmental architect - and look at the site on the former Dominican campus to assess whether it would fit all of the children.  We have got word back from the Department that it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500007#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1403699700,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I would not believe that, particularly if one looked at apartments that have been built in Dublin, and a few on Duke Street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500007#H00800","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1403699700,"counter":28,"content":"<p>This is the same architect who did not know that the autism centre was in the De La Salle centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500007#H00900","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1403699700,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Members can ask supplementary questions later.

The reason no decision has been made is because the opposition to the project has stymied all of the plans that should be made.  The difficulty is that the De La Salle Brothers will finish in 2015.<\/p><p>  I was really thinking about the parents and their concerns.  There is no doubt that the number of pupils does not warrant two extensive sites.  The schools need to be organised and we need to submit a proposal to the Department of Education and Skills.  The Department will not put anything in writing about the building of an autism unit, which we need, or the building of a general purpose hall, which we also need.  It will not put that in writing until we tell the Department what the structure of the new schools will be.  We have to say whether we are going to have a junior and senior school, two vertical schools or three schools.<\/p> <p>Nobody ever said there would be one school.  That was never in any discussion.  No decision has been made about that yet because all of these discussions have been stymied due to the level of opposition.  Until these firm proposals are made to the Department of Education and Skills, it will not give us a guarantee about what will happen.  What will ultimately happen is that the children will end up going down to the site and we will have less than satisfactory facilities for them, which will be a crying shame.  Plans have to be made on the type of structure which will be there - whatever is best - and that will decided by the educational leaders locally.  <\/p><p> People said we did not talk to parents.  I have a list of the various times we met parents and the schools met parents.  Originally, this was supposed to take place in 2014 but based on a request from the parents, it was pushed back to 2015.  A meeting was held with parents and representatives from the four schools on 21 November 2013.  It took place in Archbishop's House with members of the education secretariat.  That was when it was agreed to postpone it until September 2015 to allow parents to become aware of what was happening.  There was a meeting on 12 December 2013 when another group of parents came to Archbishop's House.  On 20 January 2014, a survey was carried out with the parents.  On 10 February 2014, correspondence was received from the Archbishop and he wrote back to the parents after that.  <\/p><p> In February 2014, one of our project team spoke to the chairperson of the parents group in regard to correspondence he got from it.  The chairperson said the yard was inadequate.  That particular person from the project team was the principal of a newly-built school with more than 600 pupils and he said his yard would fit into the yard on the Dominican campus three times over.  The yards are state-of-the-art.  There were huge facilities in schools way back but they are no longer in schools.  <\/p><p> Archbishop Martin met the De La Salle group on 11 April 2014.  One of the chairs of the three schools on the Dominican campus said quite a number of parents were in favour of this.  A number of parents who talk about the school transferring to the Dominican campus are parents of children who have all gone to the Dominican campus for the first three years, have been very happy there and there is no problem with anything.  <\/p><p> In terms of parents being the primary partners and bringing them on board at the outset, and when I talk about the different stages in the process, one must talk to the trustees and the chairpersons at the beginning before one starts to talk to the parents.  There is no point in bringing something to the parents if it will not be a viable option.  That is why it has to be brought to the chairpersons and the principals at the beginning, that is, to examine the whole situation to see if it is feasible.  Once they decide there is a feasible option, it is only then that it is brought to the parents and the staff for discussion.  There is no point bringing something to the staff or the parents if it is not going to work.  This process has been worked out between the unions and management.  I think the agreement between unions and management as to how all of this should be done is there since 1983.  As I said, it works very well anywhere it is carried out properly and where the proper steps are followed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500007#H01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403700300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms McDonagh.

The effect of diversity of patronage in my area is that it is becoming racial segregation.  If the Catholic school becomes a school for just Catholic children, is that not less inclusive than what has been provided heretofore, when all children went to the Catholic school?  I am not sure how many schools there are in Ballyfermot, but there are towns with only one school, a Catholic school.

That is why the boards of management and the archdiocese are looking at the Dominican campus.  Basically, they and the parents were given an ultimatum in the letter sent out yesterday.  The De La Salle Brothers are saying: &quot;That is it - we are out of here.  Away with you to the Dominican campus in 2015.&quot;  I do not think it is good enough for the De La Salle Brothers to do that.  I am not blaming the De La Salle Brothers - I think they have done a great job over the years - but I find it strange that all of sudden they are saying: &quot;Forget about this.  We have a site here and we will sell it or we will do whatever with it.&quot;  They have not indicated anything to the local community.  By the looks of it, they have not indicated to the archdiocese what their future intentions are regarding an area that is zoned for educational use and is ideal for the future of education in Ballyfermot.  I find it strange that there does not seem to have been any intense contact with the De La Salle Brothers to try to persuade them to stay and play a role.  It is possible to amalgamate schools without amalgamating the buildings or the campuses.  The amalgamated campuses could be shared.  There are three buildings in the De La Salle complex.  Some of them could be closed until the numbers grow in the manner suggested by the census.<br\/>If this is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>, approximately 1,000 pupils will turn up on the doors of the Dominican school in September 2015.  If the building project goes ahead, as I hope it will, those pupils will also see a building site.  Otherwise, all of these children will be pushed into overcrowded classrooms.  There are not enough classrooms to facilitate an amalgamation.  The architect has been out.  With the best will in the world, the Department does not move quickly enough to allow a PE hall and all the ancillary facilities we have mentioned to be built by September.  There will not even be space for prefabs.  At this stage, somebody needs to ask the De La Salle Brothers whether it is possible to continue to rent or lease the buildings from them on a long-term basis.  If they want to divest themselves of their interest in education in Ballyfermot, perhaps they will allow the Dominican Order or the bishop himself to lease the buildings and the playing fields for the foreseeable future.  Anyone who visits these sites - I hope the members of the committee take up the offer to do so - will see that the Dominican campus is quite an enclosed space.  It might have the size that Ms McDonagh is talking about.  As the De La Salle Order has open spaces - grass playing fields - on which children can play hurling or soccer, a PE hall will not necessarily be needed immediately.  I accept that every school should have a PE hall.  If the De La Salle Order is not willing to accommodate the patron, is there a role for this committee in encouraging the Department of Education and Skills to move to get possession of that land to facilitate the community of primary schools that will still be in the area, albeit on a reduced site?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500010#L02800","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403702100,"counter":121,"content":"<p>We have secured the use of the pitch for the school.

From her point of view, there should be an immediate discussion with the De La Salle Brothers and they should be asked, out of Christian charity, to transfer the lands and the buildings into the hands of the patrons.  As a republican, my preference would be that they should hand them over to the State and the State should run the schools.  However, I am realistic enough to understand that is not going to happen.  In this instance, that is not the wish of the parents or the community.  At the least, land that has been in the possession of the De La Salle Order for educational purposes should be transferred back to the patron or given to the patron in perpetuity to facilitate the educational development of the schools.<\/p> <p>At the moment the pupil-teacher ratio is too high.  We have discussed the matter in the committee and we all want it to be reduced.  If it is reduced, then in five or ten years' time the Dominican campus will not be big enough.  By that stage buildings only a few doors down the road will be sitting empty or perhaps knocked down or vandalised.  Furthermore, since they are big buildings, they will cost money to maintain.  They are dated and need work.  They have copper roofs, which seem to attract people who do damage.  It is a pity in this day and age that this is one of the consequences of the society we are living in.  Often there are extra costs for schools that are rather open, like the De La Salle schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500012#N03700","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403703300,"counter":177,"content":"<p>There are two issues.

I am referring to the letter stating that it was no longer in a position to be a trustee.  Can the deputation provide that to the committee?  I understand the letter that went out yesterday to parents of pupils in the De La Salle school states clearly that the campus will no longer be used as a primary school.  However, the letter does not state that the order is no longer in a position to be a trustee.  For the purpose of clarification, can the committee get a copy of the letter for our records?<\/p><p>  The question the Senator asked is really the question that all of us are asking, which is why there such a reluctance on behalf of the bishop to meet the De La Salle Order and discuss the possibility of amalgamating in that campus.<\/p><p>  We are discussing education, because that is the role of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, but there is also the matter of public funds.  Why should the taxpayer be asked to pay for a new school hall or the ancillary services that will of necessity be provided if the amalgamation goes ahead on the Dominican campus, when all of those facilities are already in place elsewhere?  There is an issue around expenditure of public finances as well.  We have a responsibility as legislators to ensure that any public money is spent wisely.  It is a role for a different committee, but certainly I would raise questions with the Department of Education and Skills if it were to grant this amalgamation.  It would have to grant it on the basis that it was providing a given amount of money.  I believe we should at least consider the feasibility of providing that money to upgrade the De La Salle campus and invest in that campus because it is a bigger campus and it has the potential for expansion in future years.  Those involved are confining themselves by amalgamating in the Dominican campus.  They are restricting the possibility of expanding in future years.  It does not make any sense.  I have heard no rationale at the committee today for the amalgamation on a smaller site with fewer facilities.  I have not heard anyone explain the rationale or merits behind it.  This is not unique to this deputation.  The Edmund Rice Schools Trust, which was before the committee last week, proposed something similar in Cork, that is, the amalgamation of a school with a bigger campus with sports facilities and physical education halls to a campus which does not even have a schoolyard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014062500013#O01100","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1403703300,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We are trying to take the matter forward.

In fact, when the forum was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, the parish priest paused the discussions and sent a letter to me indicating that the discussions were paused.  I took the view that was not a good idea and that it was a pity to pause them.  I took the view that while the forum went on the discussions should have continued.  That is what happened.  Then, when the forum finished the discussions were started again.<\/p><p>  Why was the decision made to relocate to what was formerly the Dominican site?  That decision was made by the chairpersons at local level.  It was probably the case that that was where the larger school numbers were.  There were 700 pupils there.  Rather than move 700 pupils down, they decided to move 278 up.  We have secured the sports field for the new school, because that is critical.

I think the two or three people who made the decision looked at it from the perspective of the numbers.  It was a case of looking at 700 pupils as against the 200 pupils up the road, but it was the wrong decision.  It would have been better to take the 700 pupils up to a place with playing fields and not to take the 200 pupils down into a smaller space, where it is possible at present to rent a field.

I welcome the opportunity to brief the joint committee on discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council for the second quarter of 2014.  It has been a busy period since I attended the committee meeting at the beginning of March, not least in light of ongoing developments in Ukraine and recent developments in Iraq.<\/p><p>  I propose to address the key issues by geographic region as follows: the eastern neighbourhood, the southern neighbourhood, Africa, and Asia, before touching briefly on one thematic issue, human rights.  I look forward to discussing the details with members in due course.  I will respond to the question on my visit to the United States after my main contribution.<\/p><p>  The situation in Ukraine has been the subject of detailed discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council in the period under review.  The crisis has been discussed at every Council for the past four months.  The EU is resolved to do all it can to help facilitate an inclusive and negotiated settlement and has been actively engaged in efforts to promote dialogue and peace in Ukraine since the outset of the crisis. <\/p><p>  The framework of the EU&rsquo;s response to the crisis was decided at the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government on 6 March, where a calibrated three-stage roadmap was adopted in relation to targeted measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of a de-escalation of the situation.  The Heads of State and Government endorsed, as a first phase, the suspension of talks on visa matters and on a new agreement on trade, as had been agreed at the extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council on 3 March.  The Council on 17 March implemented the second phase of measures envisaged by the roadmap, namely, travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in undermining Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. <\/p><p>  The March Foreign Affairs Council also discussed the so-called referendum that had been held in Crimea the previous day, which resulted in the territory&rsquo;s formal annexation by the Russian Federation on 18 March.  In our conclusions, EU foreign ministers rejected the poll as illegal and a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p>  At the May Council, in light of the deteriorating security situation in Eastern Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea, Foreign Ministers agreed to the imposition of sanctions against a further 13 named individuals, bringing to 61 the total number of listed individuals subject to assets freezes and visa bans.  Moreover, in a broadening of the EU&rsquo;s criteria, we imposed sanctions on two entities, that is, companies based in Crimea which are deemed to have benefited from the illegal annexation.  Following on from our discussion on Monday, the Council decided to prohibit the import into the European Union of goods originating from Crimea or Sevastopol with the exception of those having been granted a certificate of origin by the Government of Ukraine. <\/p><p>  The Council has agreed to a number of concrete measures to build confidence in Ukraine and recognise its European choice as endorsed by the Ukrainian people in the presidential elections last month.  In March, the Council supported the signing of the political chapters of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which were subsequently signed at the European Council later that week.  At the Council on Monday, my EU colleagues and I welcomed the forthcoming signature of the remaining provisions of the association agreement, including its deep and comprehensive free trade area, at the European Council later this week.  On Monday, we also agreed to establish a common security and defence policy mission to Ukraine to lend assistance to the Government in the field of civilian security sector reform.  In addition, we have consistently confirmed our support for the important work of the OSCE in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Ireland has played its full part in the OSCE&rsquo;s activities in Ukraine and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 16 Irish members of the OSCE-ODIHR observation mission that oversaw last month&rsquo;s presidential elections.  There are currently five Irish members of the OSCE special monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is engaged in a close assessment of the security situation on the ground. <br\/>The EU has also contributed financial support to Ukraine in order to assist in efforts to stabilise the macroeconomic situation and encourage the implementation of structural economic reforms.  The March Foreign Affairs Council approved the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to offer &euro;1.6 billion in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine, as well as temporary tariff cuts for Ukrainian goods.  I am encouraged that the Commission disbursed the first tranche of these vital funds to Ukraine last month.<br\/>At Monday&rsquo;s meeting, my EU colleagues and I reflected on the positive outcome of last month&rsquo;s presidential elections which, despite the difficult security situation, were characterised by a high turnout and were largely in line with international commitments.  In our conclusions, we welcomed President Poroshenko&rsquo;s 15-point peace plan which was announced last Friday.  Despite the significant challenges that face him and his Government, we remain hopeful that President Poroshenko&rsquo;s strong mandate will help advance Ukraine on the path of reform and turn it into the modern and democratic country its citizens call for.  The EU will continue to be actively engaged in facilitating a resolution to the crisis and supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s progress towards peace and stability.  For my part, I can confirm that Ireland fully supports the peace plan proposed by President Poroshenko which we hope will lead to the negotiated peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine that we all wish to see. <br\/>At the May FAC, Ministers held a comprehensive discussion on the European neighbourhood policy, ENP.  More than a decade since its inception, the ENP continues to play a vital role in helping to build an area of stability and shared prosperity in the EU&rsquo;s wider neighbourhood.  The policy was revised in 2011 to take account of the dramatic developments in the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.  Key changes included strengthening links with civil society and a commitment by the EU to offer increased aid to partner countries prepared to embrace deeper democratic reforms.<br\/>While these elements will remain central features of the ENP, it is clear that a further review of the current policy is required in light of the crisis in Ukraine and the impact it has had on the wider region, coupled with increased instability in the southern neighbourhood.  Key issues highlighted by Ministers during the FAC discussion included the need for greater flexibility in how the EU deals with individual countries under the ENP and the requirement to better tailor our approach to the differing political and economic realities faced by each of our partners.  Ministers also agreed that supporting economic development and helping to address the challenges of high youth unemployment in partner countries will be crucial in building support for the ENP in the EU&rsquo;s neighbourhood.<br\/>One of the key initiatives within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy has been the Eastern Partnership, EaP, a major priority for the EU since its launch in 2009.  The purpose of the EaP is to create a zone of prosperity and stability to the east of the EU committed to the democratic values of human rights and rule of law.  It is fundamentally in the EU&rsquo;s security interests that the EaP succeed in these objectives. <br\/>As I have said, the crisis in Ukraine has underlined the need for a more effective ENP and EaP.  Even against the background of this crisis, however, we can point to tangible progress in developing our Eastern Partnership.  The signing of association agreements between the EU and Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, expected to take place <i>en marge<\/i>of the European Council on 27 June, will mark an important symbolic moment for the EU&rsquo;s relations with our eastern neighbours.  It should also be noted that all six EaP countries, even those such as Belarus and Armenia which do not intend to conclude association agreements with the EU, are committed to the EaP and to closer co-operation with the EU.<br\/>While the focus in the EaP will necessarily be on the implementation of the association agreement, the EU will also consider how best to further develop its relations with all of the partner countries ahead of the next EaP summit in Riga in May 2015.  This will be vital to the strengthening of our European neighbourhood policy, which in turn will be a priority task for the new Commission and High Representative when they take up office. <br\/>At the 14 April Council, I participated in a strategic discussion on Bosnia and Herzegovina where we agreed to broaden the EU agenda and engagement with the country.  Member states urged Bosnia&rsquo;s leaders to focus on addressing the socioeconomic issues highlighted by their citizens during the wave of public protests earlier this spring.  We supported the development of a compact for growth and jobs that would engage local stakeholders in identifying concrete structural reforms to reinvigorate the economy.  Ahead of the general elections due to take place in October 2014, we urged Bosnia&rsquo;s leaders to reach out actively to civil society and to tackle issues such as the very high levels of unemployment in the country.  Ireland remains a strong supporter of Bosnia&rsquo;s EU perspective and I very much supported the EU in taking this broader and more active role.<br\/>The Balkan region, including Bosnia, was recently affected by some of the worst flooding since records began.  Ireland responded by providing &euro;50,000 to the NGO World Vision, as well as relief supplies such as tents and blankets, worth &euro;220,000, to help victims of the flooding. <br\/>While it is not strictly an item for the Foreign Affairs Council, I would like none the less to say a few words about Albania in the context of the wider eastern neighbourhood.  I welcome the agreement of the General Affairs Council yesterday to grant candidate status to Albania, subject to the endorsement of the European Council later this week.  This is a positive decision that Ireland very much supported.  Of course, candidate status is just the beginning of the process and much work remains for Albania before accession negotiations can begin.  It is clear, for example, that there will have to be further progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime and in judicial reform.<br\/>Turning to the Middle East, attention is very much focused at present on the grave situation in Iraq, arising from the offensive launched earlier this month by ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or al-Sham, which has resulted in the capture of Mosul and several other major cities in northern Iraq.  There can be no doubt about the seriousness of the threat posed by ISIS and its affiliated militias, not just to Iraq and its people but indeed to the wider region.  I have resolutely condemned the violence and terror that ISIS has inflicted on ordinary Iraqis in pursuing its offensive.  Unfortunately, we already know well from Syria the depths to which ISIS can plunge in seeking to impose its extremist views on others, including, for example, threats to execute Christians unwilling to convert in the Syrian city of Raqqa.  The international community therefore needs to support the Iraqi authorities in confronting this serious challenge to the security and territorial integrity of Iraq.  However, as I and many others, including EU and Arab League foreign ministers at the meeting in Athens on 11 June, have made clear, any security response also needs to be combined with strong political efforts on the part of the Iraqi Government and all its political leaders to promote national unity and reconciliation and involve all sectors of Iraq&rsquo;s divided society in governing the country.<br\/>While the links with the crisis in Syria, where ISIS also poses a grave threat, are evident, the fact is that Iraq has just successfully conducted national elections at the end of April which have demonstrated the strong commitment of the Iraqi people to their democratic constitution.  It is telling of the partisan manner in which the Maliki government has regrettably governed in recent years that a request by Prime Minister Maliki for the new parliament to convene in order to confer emergency powers to confront the current situation has been blithely ignored by non-government political representatives.  I welcome the more recent signs of accommodation among Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders which we have seen subsequently in recent days.<br\/>The EU and the UN remain fully committed to jointly assisting Iraq and its leaders in confronting the serious challenges the country faces and promoting greater inclusivity and power sharing among Iraq&rsquo;s different communities.  The Council this week had a useful meeting with the UN Special Representative in Iraq, the former Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Nikolai Mladenov, to discuss the crisis, including stepped up international efforts to confront the serious humanitarian situation.  Committee members will be aware that I was pleased to announce an initial contribution of &euro;200,000 from the Irish Aid budget last week to GOAL to assist the vital humanitarian operations it is undertaking in northern Iraq.<br\/>The Council on Monday also addressed the continuing crisis in Syria, where regrettably there has been very little progress of any sort to report over the past three months.  Earlier this month, we observed the spectacle of Bashar al-Assad being re-elected President for a further seven-year term in an election whose legitimacy could only be questioned by any impartial observer, given the many millions of Syrians in opposition-held areas who were unable to vote.  As the Council noted in the conclusions it adopted in April, any election organised outside the framework of the Geneva communiqu&eacute; and principles could have no credibility whatsoever and will only undermine efforts to reach a political solution.<br\/>Efforts to promote a political settlement are currently at a standstill following Joint Special Representative Brahimi&rsquo;s decision to stand down last month.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, is currently reflecting on how best to promote a political process and will appoint a successor to Mr. Brahimi once this process of reflection is complete.<\/p> <p>Clearly, all relevant regional stakeholders need to be engaged in the search for a political solution, as the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham or, more accurately, its return to Iraq has graphically underlined the broader threats which the wider region now faces.  While the Geneva talks process may be suspended, the principles underlying the original Geneva communiqu&eacute; providing for some form of political transition are still likely to prove relevant in the continuing search for peace in Syria.<br\/>In the meantime, the humanitarian situation arising from the crisis continues to worsen, with little progress in improving vital humanitarian access evident since the United Nations Security Council adoption of Resolution 2139 last February.  Work is continuing within the council on a possible follow-up resolution which will aim at compelling greater compliance on the part of all sides in Syria, particularly the regime, in facilitating humanitarian actors and access.  Such a resolution is clearly necessary given the limited compliance with Resolution 2139 to date.  Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, particularly Lebanon and Jordan, continue to face a serious burden in coping with the influx of Syrian refugees.  The committee will be aware that the Taoiseach visited Lebanon on 16 June where, prior to visiting our UNIFIL contingent, he met Prime Minister Salam and was able to announce a further substantial contribution of &euro;2 million from the Irish Aid budget to assist Syrian refugees and the host communities accommodating them in Lebanon.  This latest contribution brings Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to date since the inception of the Syria crisis to over &euro;28 million, firmly putting Ireland among the front rank of contributors on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.<br\/>The Middle East peace process is due to figure on the agenda for the July Council.  Ireland has been one of several countries calling for an early substantive discussion by the Council of the Middle East peace process and the EU&rsquo;s role following the suspension of the US-led peace talks at the end of April and the announcement of the formation of a Palestinian unity government earlier this month.  Clearly, the priority must be to continue to work for the earliest possible resumption of substantive negotiations which address all the core issues.  Ireland and the EU have been fully supportive and appreciative of the immense efforts expended by the US Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry, and the US Administration in recent months in trying to create a framework for substantive peace talks.  As the conclusions adopted by the Council in May made clear, these extensive efforts must be built upon and not allowed go to waste.  However, the reality at the moment is that the situation is rapidly deteriorating and there seems little likelihood of direct talks resuming in the near future.<br\/>Last week during a Topical Issue debate, the Government set out its position on the current Palestinian hunger strikes and the practice of administration detention which has given rise to this protest.  I condemn the recent abduction of three young Israelis in the occupied territories and add my voice to those calling for their urgent release and return to their families.  No possible good can be served by such a reprehensible act.  These developments as well as the stringent security measures which Israel has taken in response to the kidnapping are contributing to heightened political tensions and posing obstacles to the formation of the unity government announced on 2 June, which I have warmly welcomed as a positive development in the overall efforts to achieve a two-state solution.  Against this background, I believe it would be timely for the EU to review its overall role in respect of the Middle East peace process and consider whether it should play a more active role in confronting the obstacles which increasingly impede a negotiated two-state solution, not least Israel&rsquo;s continued expansion of settlements.  In particular, I hope a substantive discussion in July would allow the Council to consider whether several initiatives that the EU has previously contemplated in pursuance of its long-standing position on settlements, such as the labelling of settlement produce and the issuing of advice to businesses on the dangers of commercial interaction with the settlements, might now be progressed.  If we are really serious about pursuing the two-state solution then the EU needs to actively consider how it can best use its not inconsiderable leverage to persuade Israel to desist from unrelenting expansion of settlements which ultimately can only be injurious to any prospects for peace and a viable two-state solution.<br\/>Last Monday, the Council also reviewed developments in Egypt and Libya, two countries that are continuing to experience a difficult transition to democracy.  In both countries there continues to be a need for greater inclusivity and accommodation of political differences.  The recent violence and instability in Libya is particularly regrettable and it is to be hoped that the parliamentary elections being held today will afford an opening for an inclusive and transparent national dialogue within Libya, which is so urgently needed.<br\/>Meanwhile in Egypt, President el-Sisi and his new Government have taken up office following the elections in May.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, wishes President el-Sisi well, especially in confronting the many serious challenges that Egypt continues to face in promoting sustainable prosperity.  We will continue to press strongly for greater respect for human rights and the rule of law.  In this regard I join with many others in condemning the severe sentences imposed on several al-Jazeera journalists earlier this week for doing no more than their job.<br\/>The committee will also be aware of the case of Ibrahim Halawa, who is in detention in Egypt.  From the beginning of this case my Department has been liaising actively with this man&rsquo;s family.  I raised my concerns regarding the case of Ibrahim with the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, as recently as Monday at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg.  I raised my concerns at his continued detention without trial with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, on 11 November and 23 December 2013.  I followed up these telephone calls with a letter to Minister Fahmy in January expressing my continued concern at his detention.  As Ibrahim&rsquo;s case is still before the judicial system in Egypt, we are precluded from getting involved in the judicial process.  However, I assure the committee that I continue to remain seriously concerned at his continued detention and I have directed that the Irish Embassy in Cairo and the consular assistance section in my Department continue to provide all appropriate consular assistance.<br\/>The security situation in Nigeria, including the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in April, was discussed by EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May.  The Council adopted conclusions, supported by Ireland, strongly condemning the indiscriminate killing of civilians and the abduction of the schoolgirls, calling for their immediate and unconditional release and for those responsible to be brought to justice.  With effect from 29 May the EU added Boko Haram to the lists of persons, groups and entities covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources in line with the decision by the United Nations to add Boko to its list of individuals and entities subject to targeted financial sanctions and an arms embargo.  I know that the members of this committee recently invited the then Nigerian ambassador, Mr. Felix Yusufu Pwol, to update the committee on this ongoing situation.  I am aware that in his statement, Ambassador Pwol highlighted the multi-track strategy the Nigerian Government is pursuing in response to the ongoing security issues.  We will continue to support efforts being undertaken by the Nigerian Government, and those EU and international partners providing additional support, to recover the missing schoolgirls and counter radicalisation and terrorism within its borders.<br\/>I am deeply concerned about current developments in Thailand.  My Department is monitoring the situation closely.  Following months of pro-and anti-government protests, the Royal Thai Army took control of the government last month and suspended the constitution.  On 23 May I called on the military leadership to restore the democratic process and the constitution, uphold international human rights standards and hold credible and inclusive elections as soon as possible.  The EU adopted conclusions at the June Council expressing great concern at these developments and called on the military leadership to restore the legitimate democratic process and the constitution through credible and inclusive elections.  The conclusions stated that the roadmap falls short of what is required for a return to constitutional rule.  The EU also called on all parties to exercise the utmost restraint and urged military authorities to free all political detainees, to refrain from any further arrests for political reasons and to remove censorship.  Official visits between the EU and Thailand have been suspended.  The EU and its member states will not sign the partnership and co-operation agreement with Thailand until a democratically elected government is in place.<br\/>Ireland supports the efforts being made by the EU and wider international community to help Afghanistan to become a peaceful democratic state, based on respect for human rights and the rule of law.  We are heartened by the conduct of the two rounds of the presidential election and salute the courage of the Afghan people who have come out to vote, risking their lives, in great numbers to cast their democratic ballot.  We remind Afghanistan, however, that it must implement the commitments it entered into at the Tokyo conference last year to improve economic and political governance.  I remain concerned about Afghan women&rsquo;s rights.  There is a clear risk of significant deterioration in the position of Afghan women post-2014.  The gains made for Afghan women to date are fragile and we must protect them.  This will be an urgent challenge for Afghanistan&rsquo;s new president.  While I support a national reconciliation process in Afghanistan, we must guard against the Taliban returning to previous unacceptable practices.  We need to see a democratic process which fully respects the rights of all to full participation in Afghan society.  I welcome the Council conclusions on Afghanistan agreed by EU Foreign Ministers on Monday.<\/p> <p> Finally, I take this opportunity to briefly update the committee on Foreign Affairs Council related developments in the field of human rights.  On 12 May 2014, the FAC adopted new EU guidelines on freedom of expression online and offline.  The guidelines will be an important resource for officials and staff of EU institutions and EU member states in the work of the EU to protect and promote the right to freedom of expression.  Ireland is a consistent supporter of freedom of expression and we have prioritised this through our activities at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and in our engagement in the development of these guidelines.  Ireland was actively involved in the development and elaboration of the guidelines.<\/p><p> Challenges to the right to freedom of expression, including the growing threat to the safety of journalists and actions being taken to excessively restrict information flow on the Internet, is one aspect of concern.  So too is the shrinking space for civil society in many countries.  Improving the operating environment for civil society actors is a critical element in the protection of human rights defenders.  I am pleased therefore that the FAC on 23 June adopted Council conclusions to mark the tenth anniversary of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders, reiterating its support for human rights defenders across the world.<\/p><p> The adoption of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders in 2004 was one of the key priorities of the Irish Presidency of the EU in the field of human rights.  The guidelines have brought more coherence to the EU&rsquo;s policy in this area.  In line with the priority that Ireland places gives to the issues of civil society space and protecting human rights defenders, our permanent representation in Brussels hosted an event on 17 June marking the tenth anniversary of the EU guidelines.  The Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Joe Costello, addressed the event, which was very well attended, and reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s support for the work of human rights defenders.<\/p><p> That concludes my overview of discussions at the most recent Council meetings.  As always, I would be more than happy to address any questions you may have, and look forward to hearing the committee's perspectives on the many foreign policy challenges we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500002#A00400","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403695200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his very comprehensive overview and presentation of what transpired at the meeting last Monday.

In the course of that visit I had a meeting with the various organisations lobbying on the immigration issue on behalf of the 50,000 or so undocumented Irish in the US and who have been working with other groups for comprehensive immigration reform.  Following that I had a series of meetings on Capitol Hill with representatives from both sides of the House of Congress.  I met the leader of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the leadership of the Republican group, including Paul Ryan.  There was a leadership election taking place on the Republican side, following the unexpected defeat of the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, Congressman Eric Cantor, in his primary.  I also met Cecilia Mu&ntilde;oz, the adviser on domestic policy to President Obama.<\/p><p>  Prior to my visit, a degree of momentum had been building towards comprehensive immigration reform.  The Senate passed a Bill on this issue last year, which would have addressed the Irish problem and provided a path to legalisation for the 50,000 or so undocumented Irish and would also have provided for an E3 visa for new Irish immigrants.  Members of the House of Representatives took the view that they wanted to pursue their own legislation.  That has been under discussion for some time, particularly on the Republican side, which has a majority in the House of Representatives.  It was the assessment of our embassy that progress was being made along those lines.  When we planned the visit to Washington D.C. the expectation was that it would be a visit to try to give added impetus to that momentum and in particular to ensure that the issues of Irish interest would be addressed in any legislation.<\/p><p>  The press reportage of the unexpected defeat of Eric Cantor speculated that this was related to the immigration issue.  In my discussions the general view emerged that this was not an immigration related defeat, there were other factors involved.  His defeat could, however, have an implication for the progress of the immigration issue. <\/p><p>  When I was there last week it was difficult to read just how extensive that implication would be.  I got the sense from people I talked to that there is a wish to advance immigration reform.  Everybody accepts that there is a certain political imperative to getting an immigration Bill passed.  It is a difficult political issue in the US, as we know.  Congressional mid-term elections are coming up in November.  It is a question, therefore of timing.  There is a window in July when I hope something can be done.  If it goes past the summer it will be more difficult in the run-in to the November elections, which will then leave the possibility of something being done in what is known as the \"lame duck\" period or in early 2015.  If it does not happen in that period, the danger is that it will become enmeshed in the lead-in to the presidential election in 2016.<\/p><p>  In a nutshell, when my visit was planned some weeks ago we were seeing momentum.  The Eric Cantor defeat put that on pause, but I came away from Washington more optimistic of progress than I was when I went there.  It seems to me that if it were put to a straight vote in the House of Representatives now there would probably be a majority for approving immigration legislation but it is not as simple as that because a range of political factors come into play.  While I was there an issue very much to the fore of public consciousness was the movement of children across the Mexican border, as many as 50,000, in many cases unaccompanied.  That was playing into the discussion too. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500005#D00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1403695200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for making the visit.

I commend him too on his ongoing efforts in regard to the immigration reform legislation which we have discussed at question time in the D&aacute;il and at the committee.  It is very important to many families throughout our island.<\/p><p>  In my limited time as a member of this committee the list of conflict areas seems to have grown.  The T&aacute;naiste's report on meetings over the past three months indicates that.  Unfortunately, the intensity of conflict grows too.  My colleagues will take up issues relating to other areas but with regard to Ukraine I understand that hundreds of people have lost their lives over the past two months.  Decisions were made at the weekend when President Putin cancelled the ruling that allowed Russian soldiers cross the border.  The separatist leaders agreed to a ceasefire proposed by Kiev.  That ceasefire was agreed on Monday evening.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, a Ukrainian helicopter was shot down on Tuesday evening, resulting in the loss of nine lives.  In that context, further questions now arise in regard to the possibility of ending the conflict.<\/p><p> With regard to the Council meeting on Monday, I understand President Putin spoke by telephone to the authorities in the United States, Germany and France.  Did the T&aacute;naiste detect among the Germans and French any sense of confidence regarding the making of progress on ending the conflict?  There were indications that the European Union and United States would move on the basis of a common sanctions option.  It was indicated that those sanctions might be announced at the Council meeting at the end of this week.  Is that likely to happen?  Is the Union moving away from the idea of imposing more sanctions on Russia that would reduce the amount of commerce and business between both blocs?  Has the imposition of sanctions by the United States and European Union on entities and individuals been effective in any way?<\/p><p> With regard to Palestine and Israel, I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste has condemned very strongly the abduction of three young Israelis in the occupied territories.  It is a desperate deed.  The T&aacute;naiste referred in his contribution to the rapid deterioration of circumstances on the ground.  I welcome his clear statement that the European Union needs to play a more active role in confronting the obstacles impeding a negotiated two-state solution.  A predecessor of the T&aacute;naiste many decades ago, Mr. Brian Lenihan, was a great advocate of the two-state solution.<\/p><p> With regard to the expansion of settlements, to my knowledge there has been little, if any, progress in regard to the labelling of products from the settlement areas.  There are options for labelling requirements, be they imposed at EU level or within our own national competence.  Some commentators and advocates, particularly the non-governmental organisations, welcome the labelling requirements that have been imposed by the British and Dutch.  This affects not only products coming from the settlement areas but the general business and commerce between the settlement areas and their own countries.  Is the Government supporting the T&aacute;naiste on expanding or following the British and Dutch model of sanctioning?  Is there EU-wide agreement to the imposition of such sanctions at EU level?<\/p><p> Once again, unfortunately, there have been mass killings over the past few weeks in Iraq.  There has been considerable loss of life and hardship imposed on so many people.  I understand the militant extremists extended their control to the country's entire western frontier.  Is it accurate to suggest that most of the official border crossings with Syria - there is only one to Jordan - have been secured by the militants?  If so, I presume it ties in with their stated intention of creating a new independent state in the region.  If this is the case, it is a further worrying and dangerous development.<\/p><p> With regard to South Sudan, some Irish non-governmental organisations made a presentation here recently on the desperate humanitarian situation in the region.  There has been considerable loss of life in the conflict which erupted in December 2013.  I believe 1.4 million people have been displaced, and 5 million people are in urgent need of assistance.  I believe 5 million is nearly 50% of the entire population.  I am open to correction on that.  If I am correct, it is a significant humanitarian issue that requires further attention on the part of the international community.<\/p><p> With regard to Syria, there is a need for the international community to step up to the plate on the commitments made to provide much-needed additional humanitarian assistance.  I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste has raised this consistently at EU level.  Is the issue given the attention it merits by the European Union and international community?  There is concern, including in respect of Syria and South Sudan, that the most needy, deprived people are still not getting any humanitarian aid.  It is not reaching those areas most in need.<\/p><p> I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his very detailed contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500005#D00500","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403695800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  He referred to Ukraine and the sanctions.  The mood music coming out of Ukraine has been somewhat positive.  A temporary truce has been established.  The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has spoken about formally taking Russian military intervention in eastern Europe off the table as separatist leaders agree to a ceasefire.  The Russian Parliament is talking about revoking its ruling in March stating that Russia could deploy troops in Ukrainian territory.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe there is now potential for a peace process in the region?  Does he believe the sanctions have actually helped?  There has been talk of strengthening the sanctions.  Would this help conditions on the ground in regard to the mood music I am talking about?<\/p><p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that the rushing of the EU&ndash;Ukraine trade agreement, which is due to be signed on Friday, will have a negative or positive impact on potential talks?  The austerity of the agreement will probably put more vulnerable and less well-off people under pressure.  Will this have an impact on the Ukrainian Government?<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the rise of ISIS in Iraq.  There is concern about the additional financial and military resources it has after taking over many cities.  In Britain, the focus has been on the number of people from that jurisdiction who have joined ISIS.  There was concern over the number of Irish involved in the conflict.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a sense of how many Irish are involved?  There is talk of the radicalisation of many young men and the consequences on their return to Europe.  Is this a concern of the Irish Government?<\/p><p>  The main concern is the impact on neighbouring countries.  In this regard, reference was made to the border crossings to Jordan and Lebanon.  What is the position on this?  What can the European Union and Irish Government do about this?  I presume there will be considerable additional pressure, if that is possible, on these regions.  What extra assistance can the Irish Government provide?  Are there concerns about the potential for movement across the border into countries such as Jordan, thereby spreading the conflict?<\/p><p>  Mention was made of the Israel-Palestine problem.  There is now talk of a potential end to the hunger strike.  Has the T&aacute;naiste any information on that?  He mentioned the kidnapping of the three young Israeli settlers.  We hope they will be released.  The collective punishment of the Palestinian people in the occupied territory continues.  There has already been a search of 1,150 locations by the Israeli military.  We have noted the killing of three Palestinians, one of whom was a 14 year old child, Mohammed Jihad Dodeen.  He was shot with live bullets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500006#E00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1403695800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>The Deputy should ask questions, if possible, because time is limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500006#E00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1403695800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Ireland clearly needs to be standing on the side of human rights and equality.<\/p> <p>Is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about the hunger strikes and their implications?

I have noted the elections in Afghanistan and Iraq and I have been struck by how people go to such lengths and put themselves at risk to vote.  Ireland has a low turnout at elections and I am struck by the contrast with other countries.<\/p><p>  One can link the issues in Ukraine and Palestine.  The report referred to European Union sanctions imposed on entities based in Crimea but such strong moves have not been made relating to Israeli settlements in Palestine.  The UK published an overseas business risk report and the Dutch and Norwegian Governments give examples of good practice.  Hitting people in their pockets is the most effective way of dealing with these issues.  It seems that a great deal has been done on one issue but only lip service has been paid to another.  There have been reports of air strikes in the Golan Heights region and I wonder about the safety of our troops there.<\/p><p>  The BBC reported this morning that the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr. Nouri al-Maliki, has rejected a call for a national unity government.

There are serious issues relating to the Rohingya people and I have raised this before.  The situation is worsening.<\/p><p>  Last week, there was a presentation here on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and there seems to be blind faith in this agreement.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's opinion on this?  We need an open debate with independent economic analysis of the implications.  There are dangers for Irish industry and threats to human rights so we must ensure this is not dominated by corporate interests.  It links to the proposed EU free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru.  Will there be an opportunity to debate this because it has wider implications?  It goes back to the economic partnership agreement.  When the President of Ireland, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, was here as a Deputy in 2010 he demanded these partnership agreements should be fully debated.  There must be a debate on these free trade agreements and TTIP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500007#F00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1403696400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his officials and I will not go back over what has been covered.

There is a concern that humanitarian aid is not reaching those most in need.  Has consideration been given to the idea of Ireland deploying its aid through the United Nations, UN?  The UK Government mostly channels its aid through non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  Should we consider this, given that our aid does not seem to reach those most in need, especially those in areas controlled by opposition groups?  This is a major concern for human rights activists, particularly Human Rights Watch.<\/p><p>  Is it likely the schoolgirls abducted in Nigeria will be located and reunited with their families in the near future?

I will focus on the issue of the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the US and the meetings the T&aacute;naiste has had on this matter.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy has been promoted and I hope he may be elevated further in the US House of Representatives after the election in November.  The T&aacute;naiste correctly pointed out that the opportunity still exists to assist the 50,000 still living in the shadows.  The members of this joint committee have proposed to travel to the US to lend our weight to the effort, if appropriate.<\/p><p>  Thousands of Irish graduates have benefited from the intern work and travel, IWT, programme in the US in recent years.  The programme was initiated in 2008 but is to cease in October 2014.  Can the T&aacute;naiste update the joint committee on the Government's attempts to ensure the IWT programme will be extended?  Universities have contacted me on this issue.<\/p><p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work he has done to assist those who discover their passports are out of date shortly before they are due to travel.

We do not contact embassies or consulates because we want to have a chat with the ambassador or the consul in order to discover how things are going.  We need direct contact but we are informed that it is not possible for us to be given the mobile numbers of ambassadors or consuls.  The T&aacute;naiste, other members and I have the numbers of various such individuals because we asked for them directly.  I do not believe it is too much to ask that when members contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to obtain the mobile numbers and other contact details of duty officers, etc., these should be supplied.  Given the time differences which often apply and the fact that we might be trying to contact someone out of hours, it makes our job in following up on representations we have received from people who are in dire circumstances that bit more difficult.  In such circumstances, I request that the Department put in place a system whereby Oireachtas Members might be given direct access to our consulates and embassies abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500007#F00400","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403697000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.

The number of such zones - in countries such as Iraq, Nigeria, South Sudan, Egypt and Syria - appears to be increasing.  The degree to which human rights abuses continue to take place as a result of either war or a lack of democratic structures is a matter of concern.  To what extent does the international community have influence in respect of the situations to which I refer, particularly when those who perpetrate human rights abuses are under the impression that they can act with impunity because there will be no retribution against them?  To what extent can the European Union, which is a fairly powerful body, bring some meaningful influence to bear, be it in the form of sanctions or whatever, in respect of these perpetrators?  The list of conflicts appears to be growing and the type of atrocities committed appear to becoming worse.  Once perpetrators realise that no action will ever be taken against them, that they will not be charged with war crimes and that they will not be subjected to retribution, they are prepared to continue with their activities.  It must be extremely frustrating for the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues throughout the European Union that this seems to be the case.<\/p><p>  Has a policy review taken place, or is one likely to be carried out, as a result of the failure to satisfactorily close the gap with regard to the position in Ukraine and other eastern neighbourhood countries?  Have any lessons been learned in this regard and is it possible that in the future the European Union will not be treated as it was in this instance?<\/p><p>  My final point relates to Boko Haram.  The intentions of that group seem to be quite clear.  It is obvious that Boko Haram intends to continue with its nefarious activities, including the abuse and abduction of women and children.  The international community seems to be powerless in the context of making any positive intervention to deter this group from continuing with its activities.  Effectively, Boko Haram is treating the European Union and the wider global community with contempt.  As long as this continues to be the case, there will be further outbursts of violence and human rights abuses literally on a daily basis.

In the context of his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I wish him to provide us with an overview of his attitude to what is happening in the world today in respect of a number of issues.<\/p><p>  In the first instance, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate whether a there is a war taking place between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims and will he indicate whether it is religious, ideological, tribal or economic in nature?  Tragically, millions of people - Christians, Jews, and the members of minority groups in various parts of the world - are caught up in the conflict to which I refer.  Could it be said that this war is being fuelled by two major powers, that is, Iran, which takes the side of the Shi'ites, and Saudi Arabia, which takes the side of the Sunnis?  I accept that I might be completely misreading the struggles that are taking place and the consequential slaughter of frightening barbarity of human beings on one side or the other.  That slaughter includes the dropping of barrel bombs on civilians and the massacre of Sunni troops in Iraq.  Kenya is extremely close to our hearts, particularly as we are opening an embassy there, and we are all aware that the son of the former Kenyan ambassador was slaughtered by so-called Muslim extremists.  There are struggles in so many countries, including Sudan and the Central African Republic, between Christians and Muslims and terrorist groups are operating out of Mali, Mauritania and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline his views on what is destabilising global society?  Is it overly simplistic to suggest that there is a worldwide struggle for religious supremacy or that both sides in this struggle are supported by a world power?  What are the ramifications for Africa in the context of the struggle between the Muslim north and the Christian south in countries such as Nigeria and Niger and elsewhere?

He referred to the OSCE's activities in Ukraine and the fact that five Irish personnel are serving on the observer mission there, which is good.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the Helsinki+40 process, which obviously may be a factor in resolving issues, and on the role of our ambassador, Philip McDonagh, who is well equipped to provide effectiveness and efficiency in the context of Ireland's permanent mission to the OSCE?  I am of the view that Mr. McDonagh could have a positive impact on the process.<\/p><p>  How many refugees will Ireland be accepting from the Syrian conflict?  In the context of ISIS, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the threat, which is probably real, to both Lebanon and Jordan.  ISIS forces seem to be continuing to gain footholds.  There was speculation about a threat to Europe and Spain was mentioned in that regard.<\/p> <p>What preparatory discussions are taking place within Europe to protect itself from such organisations ultimately breaching European Union borders?  I refer in particular to countries where there are not sufficient armies to protect the frontiers?  I would like to hear what is being done in that regard.  There is a danger that Europe has been reacting rather than being proactive in response to the Ukrainian issue in particular.<\/p><p> On Palestine, I am pleased to note the decision on the three prisoners.  Six Palestinians, including two children, were killed by the Israeli military within the past ten days.  Such incidents seem to continue without much reaction from the international community to any great extent.  I note what has been said about banning goods produced in settlements, which was an issue the committee discussed.  I also note that such an approach is being applied in the Crimea, which is a recent conflict.  I hope the approach will be effective.  I do not understand why we do not take a similar approach to the occupied Palestinian areas.  Europe is failing in that regard.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the unity government within Palestine?  I have seen the Israeli reaction to it.  Given our experience with the peace process in Northern Ireland, I would have thought the involvement of Hamas with President Abbas creates a foundation upon which a sustainable peace could be achieved through negotiation.  Could the T&aacute;naiste please comment in that regard?<\/p><p> I note what has been said about Boko Haram in Nigeria.  The group became a big issue approximately one month ago when the abductions took place.  Surprisingly, the media only focused properly on the incident about three weeks after it occurred and it seems to have gone into the background now.  The international community must address what is happening.  The conflict has been ongoing for up to five years and many atrocities have taken place, including other abductions since the horrendous abduction of the schoolgirls.  Effective action must be taken.  There is a view that the Nigerian Government needs some support.  Has any consideration been given to such an approach?<\/p><p> I note that the T&aacute;naiste has received a communication from Ireland Stand Up on the Vatican Embassy being located in Villa Spada for the historic reasons the group outlined.

If I miss individual questions I will happily follow them up if members wish.<\/p><p>  The general theme referred to by Deputies Smith, O&rsquo;Sullivan, Durkan and Byrne was the growing number of conflicts in the world at present.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan drew an analogy between the enthusiasm of people in countries that have been long deprived of democratic rights to exercise their vote with the complacency we are beginning to see not just in this country but in many democratic countries where there is an attitude that democracy can be taken for granted, that somebody else will decide, and that there is no responsibility on citizenship.<\/p><p>  First, we must reflect on the fact that we are fortunate to live in a part of the world where we have democratic governance, where we can elect and change governments by exercising the will of the people.  We live in societies where we have fundamental, democratic civil rights, where human rights are protected by law, where the rule of law prevails and compared with the appalling poverty we see in many parts of the world we have relatively good living standards.  Let us contrast that with what we now see, namely, the situation right across north Africa, the Middle East, Ukraine and what is happening in central Africa, which has been taking place over a period, where there is a growing number of conflicts.  What is happening in Syria is astonishing in terms of its scale.  The worst humanitarian crisis we have seen in modern times is occurring in Syria and it has disappeared off the media radar.  It is no longer a news item.  We are talking about a situation in Syria for example where deliberate attempts are being made by the regime to starve people out of cities, to close the cities down and force people to surrender through starvation, yet what is happening in Syria has disappeared off the radar.<\/p><p>  Discussion is taking place on a period of commemoration of the events that happened 100 years ago.  Arguably, this time 100 years ago, before the First World War started, the world was a more peaceful place than it is today.  We have lived through a period of relative peace, certainly in this part of the world, in recent decades but that is at risk.  When one looks at the range of conflicts that is taking place and the interlocking nature of some of the conflicts &ndash; probably the most dramatic example of that is Iraq and Syria at the moment - it is correct to say that, for the most part, the border posts between Iraq and Syria are now under the control of ISIS.  Of note is the scale of the displacement of people, the suffering, the killings that are taking place and the fact that those conflicts are either being engineered, orchestrated or exploited by forces who have a deeply anti-democratic, fundamentalist, reactionary agenda that will drive society backwards.<\/p><p>  The nature of conflict now is very different from 100 years ago.  Young people from various countries are participating in the conflicts of other countries and taking their skills home with them.  That is happening in Kenya, for example.  When I was in Kenya I spoke to people there about the extent to which for example, young people from poor areas of Nairobi are recruited by al-Shabab.  They do their bit in Somalia and then go back home bringing their terrorist trade home with them.  There is a degree of complacency about what is going on.  We are going through a period in our history that is extremely dangerous, which has the potential to cause conflict on a scale that we have not known in our lifetime that will have an impact on the lives of people who live in comfort in western societies such as Ireland that is far deeper, longer and worse than the cost of petrol rising in forecourts of petrol stations.<\/p> <p>The frustrating aspect is the inability of the international community in many respects to deal with it.  The structures of the United Nations, particularly the structures of the Security Council, are not fit for purpose in the modern world.  I refer to the idea that a number of large states could have inherited a veto from the end of the Second World War and apply that now in circumstances where we need international institutions to be able to respond quickly and effectively.  That is the kind of environment in which we are operating.<\/p><p> On the issue of Ukraine, the questions asked were on our position with regard to sanctions.  The Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Minister Klimkin, came to the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and gave us a comprehensive briefing on the 15-point peace plan proposed by President Poroshenko.  We have to take some positives from some of the actions taken by Russia including the fact that there has been some change in the decisions with regard to troops and the mandate given for, effectively, invasion of Ukraine; the fact that there is some dialogue between President Putin and President Poroshenko; the three-way discussions taking place between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE; and the important role the OSCE is playing in that area.<\/p><p> In that context, the European Union is continuing to provide the financial supports it has committed to Ukraine to help with its economy.  The decision has been made to go ahead with the remaining parts of the association agreement, including the trade agreement element of that, and we expect that will be signed at the European Council meeting later this week.  There is also the agreement to send out a Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, mission on civilian security.<\/p><p> Work is continuing on the preparation of the third phase of sanctions.  It was always envisaged that this third phase of sanctions would be exercised if the situation deteriorated, and that remains the position.  We want to see progress made, and there is potential and some positive signs in that regard, and we will encourage that.  The European Union will be ready with the third phase of sanctions if that becomes necessary.<\/p><p> Some Deputies asked about the position on ISIS and people from different countries becoming involved in ISIS.  While I am sorting my notes on that I will refer to the Middle East peace process.  In reply to Deputy Crowe, my understanding is that the hunger strike is ending.  My information on that is relatively fresh.  The intention is that the Middle East peace process will be discussed at the July meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The approach the European Union has taken was very much to support the initiative taken by Secretary of State John Kerry and the United States Administration in seeking to get an agreed settlement.  There were very high hopes that this would succeed.  We had a discussion in Vilnius last September with Secretary of State Kerry at the beginning of that process where the approach taken by the European Union was to support what Secretary of State Kerry was doing, work very closely with him, as we have done, and try to get that to work.  Those discussions have now stalled.  That is a pity.  Now that they have stalled the European Union has to consider the steps it needs to take to assert its own position on the Middle East peace process.  <\/p><p> I have been pressing for a comprehensive discussion on the Middle East peace process at the Foreign Affairs Council for some time.  That will now take place in July.  It is my view that we have to take very firm action with regard to the spread of settlements.  The continuing spread of settlements will make the two-state solution physically impossible.  In terms of the response required, earlier this year the European Union issued guidelines on research activity.  That had a significant impact.  We have to take a very robust position on business activity in the settlement areas, discouraging European companies from engaging in business activity in the occupied territories.  The plan was that there would be a European Union-wide guidelines on labelling.  We will support that.  That would be very effective if it is done across the European Union.  I have always said that if it was not possible to get agreement at European Union level, Ireland would consider doing that independently as a state.  That remains the position but I am reasonably confident that agreement can be secured at European Union level on a labelling regime, and I hope that will be the outcome of the July meeting.<\/p><p> Various other issues were raised.  The humanitarian situation in south Sudan is very serious.  There are concerns about food security.  Our information is that as of 9 April, there were 803,200 internally displaced persons, IDPs, reported.  This issue is receiving a good deal of attention from Ireland.  <\/p><p> Regarding Irish support to south Sudan in 2015, Irish Aid disbursed &euro;2.5 million to the common humanitarian fund for south Sudan.  We have also provided a further &euro;1.5 million this year to that fund.  In addition, since January, 45 tonnes of emergency supplies worth approximately &euro;400,000 have been supplied, and a further 36 tonnes worth &euro;370,000 have been supplied.  A further &euro;1.3 million has been provided to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in the area.<\/p><p> On the arrest of Ibrahim Ishag, I welcome the release of Ms Ishag and her children from prison in Sudan on Monday.  I understand the family were detained at Sudan Airport yesterday and that there are some issues to be resolved before the family is free to travel.  We will keep a very close eye on that situation.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the free trade agreements.  With regard to the position on the Colombia and Peru-EU free trade agreement, the intention is that this will be brought to the D&aacute;il for approval.  There will be debate and a vote on it.  My understanding is that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will bring that to the D&aacute;il some time in the course of the year.  I should add that a standard feature of trade agreements between the European Union and other states is a robust human rights clause.  Furthermore, the Government agreed this week to the adoption of a national plan here for dealing with the issue of human rights and business activity.  The United Nations adopted guidelines to address the interface between human rights and business activity in 2011.<\/p> <p>This became part of the European Union's framework document on human rights and this week, the Irish Government agreed there will be an Irish national plan to give effect to that and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be the lead Department in its development.<\/p><p> On the opening of the Irish Embassy in Bangkok, members are aware that last January, as part of its decision to open eight missions, the Government decided that Bangkok would be one of those.  This of course was before the military takeover in Thailand.  While the Government must consider this again in light of what has happened there, the number of Irish visitors to Thailand is very high, at approximately 65,000 per year.  There is a high demand, for example, for consular services.  The existence of diplomatic relations and the location of embassies are not based on whether one does or does not like a particular government or regime in a country.  The Government must address this on the basis of what is the need for services.  The current position is that Ireland has proposed an ambassador for Thailand, which requires the agreement of the Thai Government.  We are awaiting its response on that and obviously, in the meantime we are considering the practical arrangements for it.<\/p><p> On the issue regarding the Golan Heights region raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, there was a series of Israeli air strikes on Syrian army targets in the Golan Heights area earlier this week, following the killing of an Israeli teenager.  My information is that all the necessary precautions were taken by the Irish contingent in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights and that all the personnel are safe.  I will take this opportunity to convey to all our troops who are working in peacekeeping missions abroad my best wishes and support.  I am sure I echo the position of the joint committee regarding those who serve for Ireland on missions abroad such as the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, UNDOF, as well as many missions in Africa, training missions and so on and it is opportune to send them our best wishes.  On the issue of the embassy to the Vatican, the Villa Spada now is the embassy and residence of Ireland's embassy to Italy.  The arrangement for the embassy to the Holy See will be that rented premises will be obtained for it.  Ireland recently has appointed an ambassador to the Holy See, namely, Ambassador Emma Madigan and I am sure the joint committee will wish her well in her new posting.<\/p><p> The question was raised on what is the information with regard to Irish people participating in fighting in Syria.  This is a matter that is being monitored closely by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda.  It is a matter of grave concern to Ireland and to all European Union member states that citizens or people from European states are involved.  My understanding is the estimate of Irish nationals who have gone to fight in Syria is somewhere between 30 and 40.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been engaged proactively in outreach to the Muslim community in Ireland for more than a decade with a view to enlisting its co-operation, which has been secured, in countering radicalisation.  This programme is widely admired internationally as best practice and the Garda has been asked to share its experience on that matter with other European Union member states.<\/p><p> May I ask whether there is a particular matter on which I have not picked up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500009#H00300","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403698800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>What of the reports regarding the threat of invasion to Europe from ISIS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500011#K00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to give an assessment of that.

While it is not just ISIS, that organisation is at the core of it and the lesson to be drawn from this is that where one has a well-organised and tight revolutionary organisation in a fragile situation, it can seize control very quickly and pose a threat both in the country involved and, in particular, to neighbouring countries.

There undoubtedly are strategic issues involved, as well as economic issues that come into play.  Clearly, however, the sectarian dimension certainly is at the heart of the conflict there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500011#K00800","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Senator Daly asked a question on the intern work and travel programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500011#K00900","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I will be obliged to revert directly to Senator Daly as I do not have a note on this issue to hand.

The Government is deeply aware of this from its own involvement with NGOs and UN agencies working on the ground.  The problem is the United Nations Security Council resolution that should have allowed for access for aid is not being implemented.  The regret is that the aforementioned UN resolution did not contain a means for enforcing it and again, that comes back to the point I made earlier about the way in which the veto is being used at the Security Council.  While the Security Council resolution that was adopted was the best that could be achieved in the circumstances and was the one for which agreement was reached, it did not provide a means.  Efforts are being made to try to get a more robust resolution that is enforceable and obviously, that is something Ireland is pursuing.  As the issue of accountability was raised, I might add that Ireland has argued consistently that those who are responsible for the atrocities in Syria should be brought before the International Criminal Court and we continue to pursue that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014062500011#K01300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for engaging with the joint committee in an open and constructive way.

Information notes have been circulated and I hope the information has been of assistance.  The agenda for the meeting was lengthy.  There was a range of information and any other business points on which there was little or no discussion.  This morning I will concentrate on the main items of substance, particularly those of relevance to Ireland.  I will give the committee a brief flavour of the discussions on these items and provide an indication of Ireland's position on the relevant issues, where applicable.<\/p><p>  The meeting commenced on the Thursday morning in the Home Affairs formation and the first substantive issue for discussion was the proposed Europol regulation on which a general approach was agreed by the Council.  Ireland is broadly supportive of the Europol proposal and exercised its discretion to opt into it under Article 3 of Protocol 21 to the treaties.<\/p> <p>Equally, Ireland had no particular concerns with the Presidency compromise text, as it goes a considerable way towards addressing its initial concerns regarding the proposal.  In particular, like many other member states, Ireland was unhappy with the Commission's original proposals to absorb the European Police College into Europol.  This now is not happening and those provisions have been removed under the general approach that was agreed by the Council on the Europol regulation.<\/p><p> The next two items of relevance to Ireland from a policy perspective concerned counter-terrorism policies and there was a lot of discussion on this issue at the meeting.  The EU's counter-terrorism co-ordinator updated Ministers on developments relating to the issue of foreign fighters and the ongoing efforts at EU level to assist member states in addressing this problem by way of prevention, information exchange, criminal justice responses and co-operation with third countries.  The foreign fighters phenomenon has to date seen an estimated 2,000 European citizens travel to fight in foreign conflicts, particularly the conflict in Syria.  There is no evidence of any slowdown in fighters heading to Syria.  There is serious concern over the radicalisation and security risks these individuals may pose on returning to their home countries in the EU.  The dangers involved have been starkly illustrated by the recent atrocity in the Jewish Museum in Brussels.  To date, approximately 30 individuals have travelled from Ireland to the conflict zones in question and there have been three known fatalities.  The Garda is monitoring the situation and in line with best international practice is actively engaging with those who have returned from Syria.  Its overall assessment, however, is that the threat to Ireland from international terrorism remains low.  The next and closely related item was the adoption by the Council of a revised EU strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.  In June 2013, Ireland's EU Presidency had secured the agreement of member states that the strategy should be updated.  This was prompted by concerns that the existing strategy, which dated back to 2005, had not kept abreast of recent developments and in particular, the phenomena of lone wolf terrorists and foreign fighters.  The new strategy provides a comprehensive set of options for member states to consider in addressing the threats of radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism, both domestically and in the wider context.<\/p><p> The Home Affairs session was followed in the afternoon by a joint session involving both Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.  The first item for discussion was future developments in the Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, area.  This arises from the need for a successor to the Stockholm programme, which expires at the end of 2014.  In this context, Article 68 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that \"the European Council shall define the strategic guidelines for legislative and operational planning within the area of freedom, security and justice\".  The intention is that the guidelines, which are due to be adopted at the European Council meeting which takes place tomorrow and Friday, should shape future work in the JHA area between 2015 and 2020 and will comprise the new agreed programme of priorities.  One point made by Ireland and a number of other member states was that a huge legal framework has been put in place in the JHA area over the past ten to 15 years.  From the outset of the year-long debate within the Council on the future developments, Ministers were united in the view that a period of consolidation and reflection was required.  At the discussions, this became clear and Ministers once again stated they believed the top priority for the coming years should be to fully implement and evaluate the framework that was in place and to ascertain what is working well and what required further attention.<\/p><p> To give an example, Ireland recently completed the legislative work on the DNA database and obviously international co-operation is an important part of that.  It is an example of where the legislation is in place in various countries and to focus somewhat on its implementation; it is a question of monitoring how that legislation works across the Union.  Having said that, Ireland and others stressed the guidelines should be flexible enough to allow for further legislative measures where there is clear and objective evidence that these are necessary and that any additional costs are justifiable.  Council consensus or near consensus has also been reached on a number of other themes that should inform the strategic guidelines and these include cybercrime, human trafficking and improving the links between internal and external JHA policies.  This pertains to better co-operation on the foreign affairs side and the justice and home affairs side at an internal level.  In general, Ireland is satisfied with how the Council debate has progressed and that its outcome reflects most of the main priorities and concerns it has expressed since the debate began.<\/p><p> The next item under discussion was on the ongoing preparations for the United Kingdom's impending opt-out of all pre-Lisbon treaty policing and criminal justice co-operation measures and its simultaneous application to rejoin 35 of these measures.  As members are aware, the United Kingdom has opted out but has chosen to opt back in to 35 of the measures.  This is because last year, the United Kingdom exercised its unique discretion under Protocol 36 to the treaties to opt out of all such measures on 1 December 2014, this being the date on which the measures become subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Commission's oversight and enforcement procedures.  The protocol also provides that the UK may, as I stated, rejoin some of the measures and in this regard, Protocol 36 provides that the UK must reach agreement with the Council in respect of Schengen measures and with the Commission in respect of non-Schengen measures.  A \"Friends of the Presidency\" group was established by the Hellenic Presidency in February to address all of the legal and technical difficulties that a UK withdrawal would raise.  At the Council, the Hellenic Presidency reported that its work on agreeing the relevant lists of measures, that is, the agreement about the measures into which the United Kingdom would opt back, had been proceeding satisfactorily.  I can confirm to the joint committee that last week, the UK Government reached an understanding with the Commission on the 35 measures it will opt back into on 1 December.  This is critical from Ireland's point of view.  The biggest concern of everybody at the meeting and of all the stakeholders was to avoid the risk of any legal or operational gap between the UK opting out of particular measures and opting back into them.  A legal formulation needs to be found which will ensure a seamless transition on 1 December and this work will be taken forward by the incoming Italian Presidency.  This obviously is a critical issue for Ireland and if members are interested, I can comment further on it later on.  The measures into which the United Kingdom has agreed to opt are important from Ireland's point of view because it means co-operation can continue on policing and criminal justice matters.  As I mentioned in my note to members, the areas into which the United Kingdom has opted include the European arrest warrant, Europol and a range of mutual assistance measures, including the Naples II Convention on mutual assistance in customs matters.<\/p><p> This issue was followed by a discussion on the fallout from the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union to strike down the data retention directive on the basis of incompatibility with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The European Commission is examining the judgment, including its implications for other measures and proposals, and the incoming College of Commissioners will examine the question of bringing forward a replacement data retention proposal.  As the joint committee is aware, the legislative basis in Ireland for implementation of the data retention directive is provided in the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.  The possible implications of the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment for the 2011 Act are under consideration at present.  However, although the European Union basis for the Act now has been removed, it remains in force unless the High Court finds it unconstitutional.<\/p><p> The next item was the adoption of Council conclusions on the EU anti-corruption report, which looked in detail at each country.  While it did not make particular recommendations across the Union, it went into detail on what was the position within each member state in this regard.  Ireland welcomed the publication of the Commission's anti-corruption report as a first step in the further development of a European Union response to the problem of corruption.  At the same time, Ireland submitted that significant improvements can be made to the methodology of the report in future, including more consultation with member states.  Ireland also seeks progress on the evaluation of EU institutions themselves and in this context, an acceleration of the process of EU accession to the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, which is generally perceived to be operating at a very high level in this area.  The joint session concluded with presentations on the annual reports of the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency and of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  Both reports obviously are available online and provide a good summary of the challenges in Europe with regard to dealing with the drugs issue in terms of availability, supply and treatment issues and on how states are doing.<\/p> <p> The Council resumed the following morning in its justice format, the first item being the agreement of a general approach on the proposed directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings.  I was pleased to inform the Council that, while Ireland had not opted into the proposal as presented owing to concerns relating to the functioning of our legal system, the matter had been reconsidered in light of recent domestic developments.  I refer particularly to the attendance of a solicitor when suspects are being questioned.  I expressed the hope that Ireland would be in a position to opt into the measure as soon as possible after its adoption, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The Council discussed the structural aspects of the proposed European public prosecutor's office, EPPO.  Ministers confirmed the principles of a collegial structure for EPPO as a basis for further discussion.  They also confirmed the principle that the EPPO should have a priority competence to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the Union's financial interests.  Members will be aware that Ireland has not opted into the EPPO proposal as presented by the Commission, owing to concerns over its implications for fundamental aspects of our criminal justice system.  However, we are engaging constructively in the negotiations with a view to possible participation in the longer term depending on the final outcome of negotiations.  What I can say is that a collegial model would be more conducive to Irish participation in EPPO than the hierarchical model proposed by the Commission.  That view was shared by quite a number of member states.<\/p><p> The next item comprised a discussion on aspects of the draft Eurojust regulation, particularly the structure and governance arrangements for the agency.  In this regard, it was agreed that the revised text prepared by the Presidency should form the starting point for further discussions at expert level.  While supporting the revised governance structure, a number of Ministers, including myself, made the point that the overall Commission proposal does not give full weight to the distinct differences that exist between criminal justice systems in the Union.  The proposal, particularly Article 8, which prescribes certain powers for national members of Eurojust, is problematic for Ireland and, as such, we have not opted into the proposal.  However, we will consider doing so if the measure as finally agreed is sufficiently compatible with our criminal justice system.  As the committee can see, in a number of areas the issue that arises is a question of the compatibility of our justice system with some of the proposals being put forward.<\/p><p> The general data protection regulation was considered next.  The Council agreed a partial and conditional general approach on key aspects of the draft general data protection regulation, including the provisions on territorial scope and on international data transfers.  Ireland was supportive of that approach.<\/p><p> The Council also held an orientation debate on the one-stop-shop provisions of the draft regulation on the basis of a Presidency proposal that outlined a compromise approach developed in recent working party discussions.  There was a lively debate about how data could be shared across the Union.  The approach would give the data protection authorities of individual member states a greater say in dealing with complaints made by their citizens against data controllers that operate in their jurisdiction but that are headquartered in another member state.  At the same time, the essential principle of the one-stop shop, which is that businesses operating in multiple member states need only deal with a single national data protection authority, would be preserved.  Ireland has been a strong advocate of the one-stop shop and, in common with a majority of member states, we are generally happy with the direction in which the discussions on this important matter are proceeding.<\/p><p> There was a short update on the proposed data protection directive which, along with the aforementioned draft regulation, forms part of the data protection reform package launched by the Commission in January 2012.  The proposed directive sets out new data protection rules in respect of personal information collected and shared by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of detecting, investigating, prosecuting and preventing crime.  Working party discussions on the proposal have been proceeding at a slow pace, with many member states still unconvinced of the merits of replacing the relatively recent framework decision that governs this area.  Ireland is generally supportive of the proposal.<\/p><p> The final substantive item on the agenda was the proposed insolvency regulation, on which a general approach was reached on the understanding that some outstanding technical provisions would need to be re-examined by the relevant working party to ensure their clarity and accuracy.  Ireland supported the general approach.  Overall, Ireland recognises the proposal as an important contribution to modernising EU cross-border insolvency procedures with a view to assisting economic recovery and supporting a second chance for viable businesses and individuals.  The priority afforded to the dossier by Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union, under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, gave the measure a strong political impetus from the outset.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I hope that gives the committee a good summary of the various issues that were discussed at the Council meeting and Ireland's approach to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500002#A00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403689200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>There were a lot of complex and important issues discussed at those two meetings.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned the foreign fighters at the beginning.

From our own perspective, the point I made is that a small number - approximately 30 individuals - from a Muslim population estimated at 50,000 have travelled from Ireland to the conflict areas.

I congratulate her and wish her well for the future.<\/p><p>  To follow the Chairman's question on the Minister's report on foreign fighters, the Minister stated that there are 2,000 Europeans travelling to the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.  My problem is that at a European level - I am seeking answers not on the policing aspect but on the political dimension to the meeting - some European Union member states encouraged such persons to go and bring down Assad in Syria.  We cannot have it both ways, with 17 year old children being radicalised and encouraged to go and bring down a particular regime.  Ireland needs to be more assertive with a different, independent foreign policy line to stop what is going on.  We do not want to see, as the Minister stated, that 30 individuals from Ireland have left for the conflict zone.  Many of us suspect their number is higher.  I would have concerns.

Up to 2,000 EU citizens, primarily of a Muslim background, have travelled to fight in Syria.  There is concern that some of them have signed up with extremist groups.  The reasons individuals travel are varied.  Some travel out of a sense of solidarity with their fellow Muslims and some are recruited by extremist groups, which is a concern.  Others travel for personal reasons, perhaps for adventure without realising the seriousness of the circumstances.<\/p><p>  There are areas in respect of which EU action in support of member states' efforts can take place.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that prevention is important in reducing the flow of individuals to the countries in question.  There are a number of specific initiatives that those involved in counter-terrorism and experts in the area are referring to.  First, they are suggesting the creation of a Syria strategic communications advisory team.  Second, they refer to the creation of an EU web portal to list, publicise and co-ordinate Syria related humanitarian volunteering opportunities.  Members will find this quite interesting.  I am not necessarily saying those likely to join an extremist group would be involved.  The Deputy mentioned young men, in particular.  If one could prevent 16 and 17 year olds from travelling in the first instance, it would be desirable.  The two suggestions would help in managing the issue.  Better information exchange between member states is important also.  There are criminal justice initiatives on which there could be some co-operation but the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Ireland&rsquo;s prosecutorial system would have to be taken into account.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's question about the Garda, the matter really is an operational one.  The Garda is doing ongoing work with the Muslim community here, building good relationships and responding to any issues the community might have.

This is an important balance to strike.<\/p><p>  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the recent report from Vodafone.

Both the directive and the Irish legislation provide for retention periods - the maximum amounts of time for which the data can be retained before it must be destroyed.<\/p><p>  From a domestic perspective, it is clear that the High Court will take account of the judgment in its deliberations on the digital rights case.  I have said already that the implications of the judgment for the 2011 Act are currently being examined by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality.

The ICCL believes that too broad an interpretation is allowed under the existing legislative base.<\/p><p>  I am asking the Minister to reflect on these questions, including what the ICCL has said.  The Government needs to demonstrate that, in the current environment of reviewing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and oversight matters, it will examine these Acts to see if we can put in place a more accountable oversight system.  That would demonstrate to citizens that the only basis on which we seek access to that type of data is when there is an identified threat to the security of the State which, of course, we all assume is the case.

Something that began as a benign means of protecting human rights campaigners from surveillance by some regimes that abuse their powers is now, unfortunately, being utilised by some of the vilest people who facilitate child abuse.  There has been an international focus on zoning in, using every means available, to pursue that vile industry.  I am sure every citizen would support such measures.  Perhaps the Minister could report back to the committee at some stage on what is being done at European level to combat this new threat. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500006#E00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1403690400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point illustrates the challenge involved.

We will have to wait and see what emerges from those discussions between the Heads of State and Government on the priorities.  It is part of the in-built process that those priorities go to that Council for its reaction.  The last programme, called the Stockholm programme, provided a major legislative basis and cornerstone for a stronger area of freedom, security and justice.  Ministers at the meeting were united in their view that now is the time for consolidation and implementation of what has been put in place, with a shift towards ensuring quality and consistency in implementing that legislation.<\/p><p>  There was also a strong view about the need to gather evidence so that any new initiatives would follow an evidence-based approach to new legislation.  It was felt that we should look at need, impact assessment and cost efficiency.  It was also felt in the discussion that a period was now required in which to examine the legislation that has been put in place, as well as looking at its implementation and monitoring its effectiveness.  I also mentioned new technology, as we have just been discussing, and it is seen as a priority area.<\/p> <p>In the field of asylum for example, the effective implementation of the common European asylum system was considered a priority as was legal immigration and border control.  That continues to be a priority area.  There was also a consensus among Ministers on the need to strengthen efficient return policies with linkages between visa facilitation and readmission agreements and on the fact that solidarity must be understood in the broader sense and not limited to redistribution of people.  That whole area, getting the balances right and putting in place efficient systems, is important.  Visa policy for bona fide travellers was also very important and we have taken a number of initiatives here on that.  The previous Minister did some very innovative work in that area.  Improved integration of third country nationals also featured in the debate as did mutual recognition in civil law with the removal of barriers to mobility for EU citizens and businesses.  All of those areas require further work.<\/p><p> On the security side, there was general agreement that one of the priority areas must be combating organised crime and terrorism with, as we have already discussed here, a particular focus on the radicalisation issue.  That needs a great deal of attention.  Cyber security was also discussed.

One can begin to see the scale of the issue of where drugs become available on the Internet illegally.

The PRA's primary statutory function is to manage and control the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry.  It is also a function of the authority to complete the Irish land register, which will lead to a single system of title registration supportive of Government policies on e-registration, e-conveyancing and the emerging Irish spatial data infrastructure.<\/p><p>  The key contribution of the PRA to the economy is the provision of a register of title to land which guarantees security for those dealing with property.  By international comparison, Ireland has a very extensive and well developed system of land registration with approximately 94% of the total land mass of the State and approximately 90% of the legal titles in Ireland now registered in the Land Registry.  In the case of the residue of unregistered land, that is, land that is not registered in the Land Registry, title must be proved for every transaction.  This can be a complicated and expensive process.  The PRA has an active programme to close this gap and add to the approximately 2 million individual legal titles already registered and complete the land register.<\/p><p>  From the delivery of the Law Reform Commission report on e-conveyancing in 2006, the PRA was conscious of the key role it would have to play and it set about developing the electronic services that would have to be provided to interact with and support the wider e-conveyancing process.  To this end, the PRA has always adopted an open and collaborative approach in its development of the services.  The terms e-conveyancing and e-registration are often confused and used interchangeably.  While electronic registration or e-registration is a key element of the e-conveyancing system, it only concerns the registration process, including online access to the digital register and map.  Electronic conveyancing envisages paperless transactions through most or all stages of the conveyancing process, from pre-sale to post-completion, including contracts, planning, property surveys and the dispersal of funds among all involved parties.  The PRA has designed the e-registration process with a view to ensuring interoperability with the e-conveyancing process.<\/p><p>  The PRA has also offered online access to the Land Registry since 1999 and it has successfully implemented a number of major technology projects.  E-discharges was the first e-registration service offered by the PRA.  The existing process was redesigned to allow lenders to apply securely for the cancellation of a charge or mortgage on an electronic basis without the need to lodge any paper documents.  This is done almost instantaneously.  All development was undertaken in-house by PRA staff and the system was launched in 2009.  All of the major lenders and a number of local authorities use the system to cancel their housing loans and almost 60% of all discharges are now processed through the e-discharges system.  E-charging orders were developed as a collaborative process between the PRA, the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the legislation which underpins the nursing home support scheme, which is known as the fair deal scheme, to provide for the lodgement of electronic charging orders by the HSE.  The development of the system was undertaken in-house and built on the existing e-discharges platform. <\/p><p>  The success of e-discharges and e-charging orders has given the PRA the momentum to proceed to develop further e-registration services.  In keeping with the collaborative approach adopted throughout this project, which includes all stakeholders having representation on the project board, the PRA undertook a substantial exercise in stakeholder engagement.  Phase 2 of e-registration began with a number of workshops with members of the legal profession and the lending community.  The scope of the project was agreed by all parties through their representation on the project board and was confined to the elements pertaining to registration.  It did not include elements of conveyancing outside of the registration process.  The system, which was launched late in 2013, allows users to draft and circulate deeds of transfer of registered property in a secure electronic environment.  The drafting process allows for interaction with the land register, including the digital map, and the system ensures that the correct form of transfer is produced, thereby reducing opportunities for error.  Other features include the facility to pay fees by variable direct debit and to correspond electronically with the PRA.  The facility to draft deeds of charge will be available shortly and a facility to electronically apply to protect priority - e-priority - entry on the register will follow.  A working group comprising equal representation from the PRA, the Law Society and the Irish Banking Federation is currently being formed to design the process for these new services.  Also, for the first time, the PRA has made available the schemas which will allow designers of practice manager systems to develop their systems to interface with those of the PRA.  In tandem with this, the PRA has engaged actively with other public sector bodies which hold relevant information, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Courts Service and the Companies Registration Office, to identify methods of improving interaction between these bodies. <\/p><p>  In the recently published Construction 2020 policy paper for the construction sector, the Government highlighted the critical role of e-conveyancing in providing a modern, efficient, cost-effective and secure system to support transactions in the property market.  The PRA is fully supportive of the further development of e-conveyancing while also acknowledging the difficult challenges that delivering end-to-end conveyancing presents.  In support of Government policy and as the statutory body with responsibility for property registration, the PRA will actively contribute to the review and will continue, in consultation with other stakeholders, to facilitate e-conveyancing through the ongoing development and further roll-out of e-registration services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Treacy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403692500,"counter":311,"content":"<p>The PRA is doing a considerable amount of work.

I should commence by clarifying that in my current role as Commissioner of Valuation, I do not have any direct involvement in e-conveyancing.  However, during a previous stage of my career, between 2003 and 2006, I was a member of a working group established by the Law Reform Commission which examined and reported on e-conveyancing.  The committee will be aware that the Government is proceeding with a merger of the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, who will be the line Minister, has recently approved Tailte &Eacute;ireann as the name of the new organisation.  As chief executive-designate of that new organisation, I am keenly interested in the e-conveyancing project and look forward to assisting the committee in its consideration of it.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that Tailte &Eacute;ireann will, when established, be responsible for providing the authoritative national property registration system, the national mapping and surveying infrastructure and State property valuation service.  As such, it will be the primary source of property information and location based data in the State and will assume a lead role in the development and delivery of land information services.  All of this is, of course, subject to the passage of the establishing legislation through the Oireachtas in due course.  I have provided in the appendix to my submission additional briefing material on the prospective future role, vision and mission of the new organisation.<\/p><p>  The case for implementing a national system of electronic conveyancing has been well articulated on a number of occasions, most notably in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on e-conveyancing, Modelling of the Irish Conveyancing System, published in 2006 and in a Law Society task force document, eConveyancing: Back to Basic Principles, published in March 2008.  There are also several reports and studies of the subject in the international domain and there is a general consensus that the introduction of such a system is worthwhile.  E-conveyancing has also been considered recently in the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020: a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, which was adopted by a Government decision of 16 May 2014.  I have included an extract of the relevant part of the Construction 2020 report as an appendix to my submission.<\/p> <p>The report concludes that &ldquo;a system of eConveyancing which harnesses modern technology to assist in the timely transfer of property ownership would provide a more modern, efficient, cost effective and secure system to support transactions in the property market in the future&rdquo;.<\/p><p> It is appropriate to acknowledge the progress that has been achieved already and the committee will hear this afternoon of the relevant work undertaken by the Property Registration Authority, the Law Society and others.  Construction 2020 acknowledges this progress but correctly recognises that &ldquo;moving to a full eConveyancing system will require a number of further elements over and above existing and planned developments to be put in place&rdquo;.  It identifies, in particular, the need to provide for the secure transmission of communications, the management and disbursement of funds between parties and the creation and management of digital signatures.  The report goes on to recognise that future progress &ldquo;will require representatives of the legal profession, the banking sector and the relevant statutory agencies to work together closely, and could build on work already completed on this issue under the aegis of the Law Society&rdquo;.<\/p><p> I welcome the commitment to e-conveyancing in Construction 2020 and I believe that this complements the mission of Tailte &Eacute;ireann and the vision which has been articulated for the new organisation.  Location-based, or geo-spatial information as it is sometimes called, is central to the business of both Government and the private sector.  One of the roles envisaged for Tailte is in developing and leading the implementation of a national spatial data infrastructure, NSDI.  This will result in Tailte co-ordinating the use of such information across Government and establishing and managing the standards behind such information.  In line with the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, this will facilitate and support evidence-based decision making across the relevant Government sectors and beyond.  The development and implementation of a national spatial data infrastructure by Tailte &Eacute;ireann is potentially a very significant and welcome development for e-conveyancing.  However, as with other possible technical approaches and potential solutions for e-conveyancing, this is something which could be explored as part of the review envisaged in Construction 2020.<\/p><p> While the case for e-conveyancing is very attractive, there are also substantial risks which must be quantified and managed.  Though the future strategy for Tailte &Eacute;ireann has not yet been developed, it is apparent from the preliminary work conducted to date in this regard, and outlined in the appendices, that the new organisation will be keen to play a central role in the future of e-conveyancing and will do so in partnership with its key public and private sector stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403693100,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The Law Society is very glad to have been asked to assist the committee in its review of the progress of the implementation of e-conveyancing.

This old, traditional, cumbersome and paper-based process does not serve Ireland or its citizens well.  It is costly, inefficient and in urgent need of reform.  As the committee has heard, e-conveyancing is a secure, paperless, electronic, end-to-end, pre-sale to post-completion conveyancing process.  It moves the procedures to electronic delivery via information exchange between key stakeholders, initially solicitors, lenders and the Land Registry.  Later releases would include other stakeholders, for example local authorities and planning authorities.<\/p><p>  When introduced, e-conveyancing can deliver a property transfer process that will be a world leader in efficiency, security and cost effectiveness.  It has the capacity to streamline and modernise property transactions, delivering real and substantial benefits to a range of stakeholders including Government and consumers.  Benefits to consumers can include reduced conveyancing transaction time, potentially of five working days; reduced costs due to a leaner and quicker system; reduced fraud due to built-in security checks with State agencies; and reduced errors and delays due to all stakeholders being on the one platform.  It can also improve the transparency of the process with greater transaction traceability; reduce risk due to reduced gaps in the process and secure transfer of funds; meet the demand for electronic service delivery with speed and efficiency; and increase consumer confidence in the process with modernisation, simplification and standardisation.<\/p><p>  These and other benefits are outlined in the briefing material the members received.  My colleague and I would be happy to provide further detail on these aspects or other benefits during questioning.

As has been referred to, e-conveyancing was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2006 and endorsed by the Government in the recent 2020 construction strategy, which acknowledged the work done to date on this project under the aegis of the Law Society.  The European Commission in its 2014 Assessment of the National Reform and Stability Programme for Ireland urged e-conveyancing to be progressed and identified it as an important factor in improving Ireland&rsquo;s business environment.  The project aligns with and facilitates implementation of the Public Sector Reform Plan, eGovernment strategy 2012&ndash;2015, which will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a leader in e-Government and e-commerce, improve our international ranking in property benchmarks, contribute to the green agenda and deliver efficiencies in revenue collection and electronic funds transfer thereby increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.<\/p><p>  The transformation to e-conveyancing also fits with the streamlining of Government land administration services through the merger of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority into Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The Department of Justice and Equality is the lead Government Department for this initiative.  While the Property Registration Authority has made great strides in advancing the electronic registration element of the process, and these initiatives have been actively supported by the Law Society and its members, much remains to be done to achieve full e-conveyancing.<\/p><p>  The support across the board for this project is not surprising as it is a simple, innovative and effective approach to modernisation that is being achieved in other common law jurisdictions such as Australia, Scotland and Canada, which have realised the strategic benefits.  These include the opportunity for inward investment and benefits for all owners and investors in the property sector.  Implementation is achievable only if the funding and mortgaging aspect of the conveyancing transaction is included.  The Law Society would like to see the lenders commit fully to the implementation of this modernisation program and work with the Law Society, the Property Registration Authority, Tailte &Eacute;ireann and all the other players to make e-conveyancing a reality for the benefit of Irish consumers in recognition of the fact that this project is one of critical national importance and has core Government and cross-party support.

Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here and meet the Chairman and members.  I am the chief strategy and integration officer for Teranet, an international leader and pioneer in electronic registration systems, e-conveyancing and eCommerce.  I have led the Ireland e-conveyancing project on behalf of the company since the fall of 2011.  Teranet is based in Ontario, Canada and has 20 years of experience in modernising and managing land registration systems and e-conveyancing solutions.  We have modernised and digitised approximately 5.9 million land records, or land titles, and have digitised 90 million documents and approximately 500 million pages of information in the process.  Teranet developed, owns and operates Ontario&rsquo;s electronic land registration system, ELRS, and facilitates the delivery of electronic conveyancing and land registration services on behalf of the province.<\/p> <p>Teranet built the world&rsquo;s first electronic land registration system with full digital submission, collaboration and validation capabilities.  We are now into our second large scale re-engineering and it remains one of the world&rsquo;s most sophisticated, efficient and modern systems.  We have 475 knowledge workers who facilitate that process on behalf of the government.  Teranet offers robust features and access options to consumers and customers in the real estate, legal and financial industries as well as governments and utility companies, in addition to the collection and disbursement of appropriate fees to the government.  Our products include the capability to provide electronic mortgage instruction and the electronic transfer of mortgage funds in a secure real time environment, which is a critical aspect of e-conveyancing.<\/p><p> Teranet has successfully leveraged its partnership with the government, lenders and legal community to deliver end-to-end e-conveyancing solutions across Canada, while maintaining and enabling statutory obligations and adhering to existing government policies and business rules.  Teranet&rsquo;s conveyancer solution is the dominant legal work flow solution in Canada.  It is in a competitive environment.  We probably process 65% of all property transactions through that software.  Demonstrating the province&rsquo;s confidence in Teranet, the government of Ontario, Canada&rsquo;s largest province, extended its exclusive relationship with the company by 50 years in 2010.  The ability to negotiate a contract to protect the government's interest for 50 years was significant given issues such as fee certainty, data protection, privacy and ownership of the system.  We have a concession and we negotiated that at the end of 50 years, the government can take back the system if it so desires and we have a process in place to deal with that.<\/p><p> In 2012, the province of Manitoba signed terms for an exclusive 30-year licence to operate the end-to-end property registry agency and modernise its land registration system and processes.  Teranet is a wholly owned investment of the Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System, OMERS, through Borealis Infrastructure.  What is nice about our organisation is the profits go to public service pensioners and, as such, Borealis Infrastructure has a long-term, low risk investment profile for opportunities.  OMERS is one of Canada&rsquo;s leading pension funds with than $55 billion in assets.  Borealis Infrastructure has proven experience and a sound reputation as an effective partner with a patient, long-term, low risk investment model.<\/p><p> The combination of Teranet&rsquo;s intellectual capital and operational expertise with Borealis Infrastructure&rsquo;s financial capital and infrastructure investment-financing expertise creates a unique value proposition for Ireland as Teranet seeks to expand internationally.  Teranet, through a long-term partnership with the Law Society and in co-operation with Revenue, the PRA, and lenders, seeks to significantly improve the efficiency, transparency, speed, predictability and cost of the property transfer system in Ireland through the automation of the routine aspects of the conveyancing process and the use of an electronic conveyancing hub by all solicitors and lenders.  A direct link to the PRA is envisioned to secure virtually real time registration and also to Revenue to facilitate payment of transfer taxes and property taxes.  On transaction close, the system will ensure all requirements of the conveyance have been satisfied and all relevant parties&rsquo; obligations have been met.  Funds will flow electronically on the day of close to ensure all disbursements have been completed and confirmed.<\/p><p> Teranet proposes to fund the design and build, and to own and operate the e-conveyancing system and will generate revenue through value-added transaction fees collected by solicitors on behalf of their clients.  Interfacing with the hub will bring significant benefits for all stakeholders, including increased efficiencies, reduced costs, reduced risk and improved reporting capacity on conveyancing transactions.  We see contracts being developed to ensure everyone's interests are protected through this process.<\/p><p> We have invested more than &euro;300,000 over the past 36 months to complete a preliminary assessment and due diligence study, working in formal partnership with the Law Society and with the support and involvement of the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, the PRA and BearingPoint Ireland to assess the feasibility of an electronic conveyancing system for the Republic of Ireland.  Through an extensive stakeholder consultation process, we collectively have confirmed that e-conveyancing is an achievable goal with significant benefits for all stakeholders.  It is supporting the Government&rsquo;s e-business initiatives and is a sustainable business model.  Solicitor and lender consultation has reinforced the acceptance of the need for change, a recognition of the productivity and efficiency gains and a better conveyancing experience for citizens and stakeholders.<\/p><p> We have also engaged local legal counsel to understand the competition, data protection, intellectual property, privacy and consumer protection legislation and regulations and we are confident that the structure of our model and agreements that would be negotiated would satisfy and-or exceed all Government and stakeholder interests.  Under the envisioned model, Teranet Ireland - we would set up an organisation in Ireland - is committed to expend approximately &euro;500,000 to establish a corporate entity in Ireland to manage the development, roll-out and operations of the e-conveyancing system and to invest &euro;6 million to design and build a world class bespoke end-to-end conveyancing system with our strategic partner, BearingPoint Ireland.  We will leverage our experience, intellectual property, capabilities and systems that we have developed in Canada.  However, the service will be built in Ireland and serve the specific needs of the Irish e-conveyancing community.  Initially, we will create ten to 12 full-time positions in Ireland and utilise an Irish IT firm to host and support the e-conveyancing system in Ireland, and we will make a direct contribution to the economy of approximately &euro;50 million in operational expenditures over the life of the long-term contract.<\/p><p> We look forward to working in close co-operation with all stakeholders and State agencies to design, build and implement an e-conveyancing solution which has robust governance and oversight arrangements in place to protect the interests of all parties, including consumers.  We are confident that the combination of our reputation and success in working with government agencies, solicitors, lenders and other partners will enable us to collaboratively facilitate the reformation of the e-conveyancing processes in Ireland for the benefit of citizens today and in the future.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500012#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dennis Barnhart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403693700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>That was an interesting presentation.

There is a competitive environment between solicitors as conveyancing is a very competitive business.  It is interesting that many of the big Dublin firms do not bother with residential conveyancing except for their very expensive clients because they cannot make money at it.  There is vigorous price competition in the market and if the process is made easier and quicker the facility for solicitors' fees may well be reduced.  More significantly, in any conveyancing transaction there are a number of outlays such as law searchers' fees, commissioner for oaths' fees and other such matters which typically cost &euro;200 or &euro;300 per transaction.  These will be eliminated under the new system so there will be immediate benefits for the consumer.<\/p><p>  There may also be more indirect, but nevertheless tangible, benefits.  In our model we could reduce the transaction time from two or three months as it is at present to four or five days.  Typical residential buyers of property are renting and if they can get into their new home in one month rather than six months it will save them several thousand euro in rent.  Legal fees will probably decrease further.  There is no doubt that outlays associated with conveyancing transactions will be eliminated and more intangible savings will doubtless be made by consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403694300,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dorgan for his reply because it is very good news for consumers and should be highlighted.

It reads: \"In collaboration with key stakeholders (the legal profession and the banking sector) we [the Government] will review and report on the steps required to deliver a system of eConveyancing in Ireland, including the resource implications and timeframes for delivery.\"  The Government stakeholders will include the Department of Justice and Equality, which I believe will be the lead Department as the responsible body, the PRA and other relevant Departments and stakeholders, for example, the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  The review and the report that will follow from it comprise the key step in addressing the matters that the Senator raised.  Therefore, there is a mandate to go to the next stage and examine the situation.<\/p><p>  There will be several key considerations.  The Senator adverted to some of them.<\/p> <p>For example, in terms of legislative implications certain provisions of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000 would have to be implemented.  In regard to whether participation would be voluntary or mandatory and so on, issues such as competition, procurement and so on will be looked at as part of the review.  I would envisage that the Department of Justice and Equality will lead that review, which appears to be what is mandated under Construction 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500015#O02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403695500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>From our perspective, it was envisaged initially that the relationship would be with the Law Society rather than Government.

The steering committee was structured in a manner which provided for involvement of these groups such that as we worked through the assessment of the opportunity, we involved Government stakeholders.

Perhaps for the assistance of the committee I should explain what e-conveyancing is and is not.  In case the impression was created that e-conveyancing will be a giant new behemoth with its foot on the neck of the consumer, it will be nothing of the sort.  As everybody will be aware, what currently happens is that solicitors, through a conveyancing transaction, interact principally with each other but also with banks, auctioneers and, in particular, the PRA and the Revenue Commissioners.  Nothing in that regard will change, except that the process will be electronified.  As stated by some speakers, there is already in effect compulsory electronic interface in the case of the PRA and the Revenue Commissioners in that solicitors can no longer pay stamp duty for their clients by way of cheque and must do so online.  This change has been embraced by the profession.  Also, there has been astonishing progress made by the PRA in the implementation of its own electronification regime, which we acknowledge.  As also stated earlier, a number of these processes are already carried out electronically.  All that this process will be is an extension of that in order that solicitors will engage with each other electronically and, in particular, engage electronically with the banks in order that funds transfer electronically such that cheques, bank drafts, pieces of paper, cash and so on are not flying around the place in an indiscriminate and uncontrolled manner.  That is all this system is about.<\/p><p>  When this system was first considered, the thinking was that a giant beast would be created.  We quickly found that was not going to work.  We then began searching worldwide for providers in this area and found Teranet Inc., which appeared to us to be world leaders in this type of business.  Having investigated the Irish regulatory, political and economic environments and every other environment involved, Teranet reached the decision that it could make a business case to partner with the Law Society in electronifying the existing process.  That is all it is.  As I said, everybody is on board, with perhaps one exception.  In terms of what we are looking for, there is a clear political consensus and a policy statement that this is a good way to go but the words Hamlet and the Prince come to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403695500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dorgan for his very helpful clarification that what is proposed is not in fact a major change but a change in process rather than substance.<\/p><p>  I have one follow-up question, if I may.

It is perhaps linked to the earlier point in regard to legislative change to the Electronic Commerce Act.  The wording of section 10 of that Act is a little odd in that it appears to allow electronic contracts but not electronic deeds.  For the PRA to implement e-registration, a statutory instrument to remove that would be required.  That is the only immediate legislative change we have identified.  Obviously, this process requires electronic signatures.  A number of other jurisdictions have introduced an advanced electronic signature provision under which a solicitor receives authority from the client to engage on his or her behalf with the hub or electronic environment.  We initially proposed to go that route on the basis that it was the route chosen by other jurisdictions.  However, when we consulted solicitors on the matter, they were concerned about the potential risk implications of that and felt we should look to a process whereby clients would have their own electronic signature but would still have to go the solicitors office to apply that signature.  We are now looking at the provision of a one-time only electronic signature which would cease following a particular transaction.  Because people often only purchase a property once in their lifetime, an advanced electronic signature is only required once.  This perhaps fits into the broader e-Government agenda.  There may be need for engagement between the State agencies and Government on how we could implement this so that it would fit into other proposals, for example, e-litigation, e-Courts Service and so on.  There is a broader agenda that needs to be looked at.  As I said earlier, we have identified a need for only one statutory instrument at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500016#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403695500,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their interesting presentations.

If the Government and all other interested parties move on this, and all those present have made a good case for the importance of e-conveyancing to our economy and so on, could procurement issues arise?

We got to a point in approximately March 2013 where the banks had been given some time to do their homework, and at that time a project manager was appointed to do a business case for the banks.  We gave them extra time to do the business cases and they eventually reverted to the society in November 2013, setting out a number of concerns.  One of the major concerns was that \"during the course of the investigatory phase, consideration of the role of government both from a regulatory and sponsorship perspective was deemed critical to the success of the project\".  At that point it appeared that the banks were saying that if we could get the Government to endorse the project, they would be happy and we were delighted, as I mentioned, that the 2020 initiative gave such Government endorsement.

ESC rights are those human rights relating broadly to issues such as health care, education and an adequate standard of living, which includes the right to adequate housing.  Along with civil and political rights they are part of the international body of human rights.  Amnesty International Ireland has launched a report, and the Chairman attended the launch, \"Bringing ESC Rights Home\", a copy of which has been circulated electronically to the committee.  We also have printed copies for the members.  This report provides greater detail on some of the points we will outline today.<\/p> <p>Legal protection of ESC rights is by no means a new or radical idea in the Irish context, or globally, and is very much within our political tradition.  In 1937 the framers of the Constitution put some of these rights in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann before they were ever set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UDHR.  The UDHR declaration was drafted in 1948 and makes no distinction between civil and political or ESC rights.  Over the years, legal protection has also been granted to ESC rights in various treaties which Ireland has signed up to, both at an international and regional level.  For example, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 is a creation of states themselves, and was intended to be binding.  Ireland ratified the ICESCR convention in 1989 thereby agreeing to be bound by its provisions.  At a regional level, the European Social Charter also affords protection for these rights, along with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.<br\/><b><\/b>Let me answer why ESC rights should be made enforceable.  First, at the heart of human rights law, and expressly stated in the UDHR, is the right of everyone to an effective remedy.  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the UN expert body charged with overseeing the implementation of the ICESCR, has said that it would be difficult for a State which has signed up to the ICESCR, to justify its failure to provide any domestic legal remedies for the violation of ESC rights.<br\/>The right to a remedy does not mean that everyone should be able to run to the courts whenever something goes wrong.  This is not what human rights law envisages.  Remedies take different forms.  We already have some bodies and structures in place in Ireland, such as the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Ombudsman, the Equality Tribunal or administrative complaints mechanisms.  Parliamentary committees also play a vital accountability role.  For example, in Amnesty International's report, we highlight the distinctive role that the parliament's constitutional law committee plays in Finland.  These bodies and processes play a crucial part in ensuring Government accountability but operate within specific mandates and limitations.  None can take the place of judicial remedies and people should have access to the courts, as a last resort.  International bodies and procedures have on several occasions recommended that ESC rights be made legally enforceable in Ireland yet no steps have been taken in this direction.  As Justice Albie Sachs, former judge of the South African Constitutional Court says in the foreword of our report, the Constitutional Convention recommendation is the golden opportunity for the Government to make this happen.<br\/>Second, making ESC rights legally enforceable provides individuals and groups with a means to hold the Government to account.  ESC rights litigation can also function as a corrective mechanism for the political system, shining a light on issues that otherwise might not be addressed.  Case law on ESC rights from other states gives examples of how neglected issues have been brought to the fore and resulted in positive changes in law and policy, therefore directly impacting on people's lives.<br\/>Third, ESC rights are as much a tool for government as they are for civil society.  When we talk about accountability we are not simply talking about a means through which we react to or repair failure or wrongdoing.  Accountability is a vital tool for those charged with making complex and difficult decisions; one that can guide and strengthen decision-making and the development of law, policy and practice.  ESC rights are outcomes focused on but also concerned with the process that is used to achieve same.  For example, ESC rights require the Government to take steps, over time, to deliver on those ESC rights outcomes identified in international law.  They do not specify the policies that must be pursued to deliver on these rights.  They require that the Government adopts appropriate processes for planning and decision-making and that decisions are made in a transparent, participatory manner, using reliable evidence.<br\/>Government decisions and expenditure must be geared towards those outcomes.  For example, one outcome is that everyone has access to health care without discrimination, when they need it.  This includes affordability of health care.  How that is done is up to Government.  For example, human rights law does not prescribe public health provision over private only that all are able to access it without discrimination.<br\/>Accountability has become the byword in recent years for the promise to do things differently, to make better decisions and deliver better outcomes.  If we look at how courts have protected ESC rights in other countries, like Latvia and Germany, we see a focus on good process.  The courts ask the question whether decisions have been made in a transparent manner, using reliable evidence.  Real accountability, also requires that decision-makers consult with those affected by their decisions and when implementing these decisions.  In this way accountability becomes a vital tool to inform good decision-making and ensure that policy decisions serve the people they most affect.<br\/>Fourth, making ESC rights legally enforceable, would show that the Government attaches the same importance to all human rights, civil and political, economic, social and cultural.  While we are slowly emerging from the economic crisis, this is still not felt by many people who are currently affected by issues such as access to health care, and adequate housing.  Showing a strong commitment to the protection of ESC rights has never been more important and what better way to do this than in the Constitution, the basic law of the State?<br\/>Finally, making these rights legally enforceable, would also bring Ireland in line with a growing trend among many countries to legally recognise ESC rights as enforceable.  Around the world the right to  health care is included in 133 constitutions, the right to housing in 81 constitutions, the right to work in 136 constitutions, to name but a few examples.<br\/>What is stopping us?  In Ireland, as sometimes in other countries, myths and misconceptions around ESC rights have hindered their application in the domestic legal system.  These myths and misconceptions often relate to the nature and definition of ESC rights and the resources involved.  In the interest of brevity I shall only speak about two misconceptions here but we address more of them in chapter 2 of our report.<br\/>Regarding resources, there is a fear among some that ESC rights require huge levels of resources and that it is a reason they should not be given legal protection.  International human rights law recognises that no government has infinite resources and cannot be held to an impossible standard of perfection.  Important checks and balances are put in place.  Under the ICESCR, states must progressively realise the rights in the convention, subject to the maximum amount of resources available to it.  This phrasing is directly reflected in the full recommendation of the Constitutional Convention.  These may seem like abstract concepts, but the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has laid out clearly what the concepts mean in practice.  This is outlined further in our report.  It is not about spending more and more but ensuring that the resources we do have are used appropriately, in a transparent and evidence-based way, delivering equitable outcomes for all.<br\/>A particularly prominent argument against enforceable ESC rights is the separation of powers argument.  It is claimed that legally enforceable ESC rights distort democracy as the Judiciary become unelected decision-makers.  ESC rights throw up complex and difficult questions.  But if we look at the body of case law on ESC rights from other jurisdictions, it shows that courts have found ways of dealing with these issues that are appropriate to their respective legal system and respects the separation of powers.  For example, the South African Constitutional Court has adjudicated on many ESC rights cases but limited its judgments to its appropriate role.  It has made clear that when considering the reasonableness of state actions, it would not look at whether better measures could have been adopted or public money could have been better spent but whether the measures that were adopted were reasonable.  In our report we show how countries such as Portugal, Finland and Germany have enforced ESC rights.  Different approaches can be adopted in different national contexts.  These approaches are outlined in greater detail in our report.  It is clear that it is possible to adjudicate on ESC rights in a way that respects the separation of powers between the different branches of government.  Examples from these jurisdictions also show that it is possible to take what might appear to be abstract ESC rights related obligations and apply them in domestic legal systems.  There is no reason that the same cannot be done in Ireland.<br\/>In conclusion, time and again we have seen the public support that exists for ESC rights.  In polls carried out by Red C on behalf of Amnesty International this year, 71% of people polled believed that the Constitution should be amended to protect additional ESC rights.  The Constitutional Convention overwhelmingly voted in favour of strengthening protection of ESC rights in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Also, according to the terms of reference of the convention, the Government now has until the end of July to respond to its recommendation.<br\/>Amnesty International Ireland urges the this committee to press for the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Constitutional Convention on ESC rights, that the Government engages robustly on the issue, and that it ensures full transparency and clear timelines in any measures adopted to take the matter forward.  Giving greater legal protection to ESC rights in the Constitution would not cure all our ills.  It would require that the Government designs systems that prioritise good, evidence-based decisions, in the interest of all our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500018#R01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403697300,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Gorman for his presentation and I call Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500019#S00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1403697900,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Gorman and thank him for sending us the hard copy of the document which, I confess, I have not read from cover to cover.

When we talk about accountability and effective remedy, it does not mean that people find themselves taking the State to court on a routine or regular basis but that a whole range of remedies are provided, starting with the administrative which are meant to be corrective and engaged to identify and address problems rather than an almost a punitive mechanism where the State is being brought to court in some way.<\/p><p>  The reason we flagged that is that first of all, it is a critical point and a really core principle but also to try to encourage decision-makers to engage with the concept that these kinds of processes support effective decision-making.  They are revelatory rather than adversarial, so we reveal where a difficulty or an issue arises and an approach is adopted to it which is about identifying and constructively engaging to address an issue and to inform the development of a solution.  Of course, in situations where a difficulty is intractable and where somebody, therefore, needs a remedy before the courts, that needs to be available to people as a last resort.  <\/p><p>  It is important to recognise that the Irish Constitution has ESC rights provisions in it.  There has been jurisprudence on ESC rights in the Irish courts.  If one looks at some of the cases taken over the years on the right to education, for instance, it demonstrates the Irish courts can adopt an approach, adjudicate on these issues, deal with complex issues and can engage effectively within their role to reveal where problems are and then it is back to the Legislature - the Oireachtas - to address whatever those difficulties might be.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500020#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1403697900,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Gorman mentioned South Africa and that Justice Albie Sachs, former judge of the South African Constitutional Court, said that the Constitutional Convention recommendation is the golden opportunity for the Government to make this happen.

That is not, in any way, to take away from the very significant rights issues that still exist in South Africa, including economic, social and cultural rights issues.  Flagging South Africa as an example is to flag a constitutional model that has been able to work from a judicial perspective - a court perspective - and which has demonstrated an ability to deal with incredibly complex issues from very broad issues such as the supply of antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV to very specific issues such as a case taken by an individual who felt he was being denied his right to health because he could not access dialysis.  The court made a challenging but really thoughtful decision to say that it is reasonable for the State not to provide a health service to this individual on the basis of likely outcome for the individual and scarce resources and that it had an obligation to consider, and it was reasonable for the State to consider, the broad needs that existed and that might mean that an individual case's specific needs were not addressed.

It is precisely when one has fewer resources that one needs a framework that very clearly identifies the criteria we use to decide how one will spend those resources.  It is precisely at a time when one has limited resources that one needs really good decision-making - evidence-based, outcomes-focused and transparent decision-making.  That is exactly what one needs when one has limited resources.<\/p><p>  Human rights law does not say that states must sign a blank cheque but what is says instead is that within the limits of available resources, there is a framework which has to be applied in how states decide how they are going to allocate those resources.  It is about minimum obligations.<\/p><p>  When we talk about minimum obligations in that regard, we need to remember that this convention was adopted in 1966.  Sometimes people talk about ESC obligations as if these are wildly aspirational, way off concepts.  These were minimum obligations states agreed were appropriate in 1966 when the world was a much poorer place.  Countries like Ireland were much poorer.  These are standards Ireland signed up to in 1989.  I left Ireland in the flood of emigration in 1986 and at a time when Ireland had a very depressed economy and yet in 1989, Ireland believed that it could sign up to the binding obligations.<\/p> <p>Consequently, that argument based on limited resources is compromised for many reasons but fundamentally because it is when one has fewer resources that one needs better decision-making.  One needs transparency, clarity of purpose, outcome-focused decisions and decisions that are solidly grounded in evidence.  This is what a human rights framework would require.  Governments decide what they can do within the maximum of available resources and the focus is on the process that is used, not the amount of money involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500020#T01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Gorman thinks it would lead to the prioritisation of resources and bring out the best and most effective-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500021#U00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403698500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500021#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I will give Mr. O'Gorman the example of an adult with an intellectual disability whose parents, one of whom has dementia, are in their 80s and 90s and for whom a residential place is sought.

If we come back to the particular case in South Africa that Mr. O'Gorman mentioned about the dialysis treatment, it concerned a man who could not get access to dialysis treatment because there was a scarcity of resources and at the time, the hospital had in place guidelines stating who would and would not qualify for dialysis treatment.  This particular man did not qualify and without that dialysis treatment, he ultimately would die.  However, the court held that the guidelines that had been put in place were reasonable because the state was under such pressure in terms of resources.  Moreover, were those kinds of guidelines to be changed to apply to this particular man and to others in his position, it would then require a huge increase in the health budget, which simply was not reasonable.  The judgment was that this decision had been made in good faith and as no more resources were available, there was nothing the court could do.  However, were these rights to be included in the Constitution in the first instance, as Mr. O'Gorman has stated, on the macro level there would be better decision-making that was evidence-based and which had in place indicators, benchmarks and timeframes, as well as engagement by civil society and an understanding on its part as to what the Government was doing and why it was doing it.

This has been seen in respect of primary school education in Ireland previously and the concept is not completely foreign in Ireland, as it has happened in the context of primary school education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500021#U00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Pia Janning"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and I thank Amnesty International for the submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014062500021#U01000","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1403698500,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I also have a question in this regard.

The first petition for reconsideration today is Petition No. P00027\/13 from Mr. Damon Matthew Wise, national secretary-CEO (voluntary) of the National Board, directors, shadow directors and executive committee.  It was submitted by a corporate body.  The petitioner is seeking to raise proposals to allow for legislative consultation and statutory powers to be afforded to the newly founded National Disability Council of Ireland when new legislation is being prepared which will have an impact on people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  The secretariat made contact with the petitioner in the first instance seeking clarification on the issues he wished to have addressed by the joint committee, as this was unclear from the information provided within the petition.  The petitioner was contacted by phone initially where the secretariat discussed what the petitioner was seeking to achieve and following that discussion he agreed that he would gather further information and come back to the secretariat with clarification.  Despite further contact by letter and by telephone, no information has been received.  The decision of our committee is to deem the petition inadmissible as no previous action has been taken.  However, under the committee, we may wish to refer the issues.  It is proposed that the petition be closed because we have not received the document but the petitioner has the right to submit the relevant documentation at a future date if he wishes to do so.  That is agreed.<\/p><p>  Petition No. P0005\/14 is from Mr. James John Collins on the treatment of prisoners in Irish prisons.  Our committee has deliberated on this and we deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 165C(1)(g) which refers to a petition that \"is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system\".<\/p> <p>We have agreed that.  The matter is closed.<\/p><p> Petition No. P0006\/14 is from Ms Christine O'Brien.  The petitioner is seeking an examination of the conduct of the Child and Family Agency, formerly the HSE, in terms of allegedly unqualified subcontractors and director of advocacy services.  This is an individual case between a mother and the HSE in relation to the complaints process after the welfare of her children came into question.  The petitioner is questioning the qualifications of the staff working on her case, the procedures and protocols followed by the HSE, and she is also making claims of false reports being produced by HSE staff.<\/p><p> As this is an individual case between the HSE and the petitioner, Standing Orders do not allow us to deal with the matter.  However, it is proposed that we write to the Ombudsman advising the office of the advice we have given to the petitioner.  The Ombudsman might wish to examine the case.  Therefore, we must deem the petition to be inadmissible.  However, the secretariat notes that this week the report on the Review of Adequacy for HSE Children and Family Services 2012 was laid in the Library.  Given that there are 113 pages in the review, it was agreed that the clerk would prepare a briefing for the members with a view towards examining whether there may be a public oversight issue within this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014062500003#D00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403708700,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I support the recommendation that we consider whether there is an oversight issue, not least because wearing the committee's other hat, issues arise in terms of the tardiness of some of the HSE's responses to the Ombudsman over the years.

I understand that if a petitioner has not taken any other action and the matter is not taken up, there is an option for him or her to come back to the committee following an attempt to seek redress in another forum.  The petitioner in question did not do that.  It is important to remind anyone who is interested in sending a petition to us that the Standing Orders oblige us to ask people what other action they have taken.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As that is the housekeeping out of the way, I call Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500003#C00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403685000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  As he noted, there are two areas for discussion, namely, the construction of the Luas cross city line and plans for the transport infrastructure.  I have extended the latter subject beyond Dublin and have covered the other cities in the State.  To assist me in dealing with questions, I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, the NTA's deputy chief executive, who manages transport investment in our organisation.<br\/>First, as for Luas cross city, in summary, it is a 6 km-long light rail project that extends an existing Luas line right across the city to the new Dublin Institute of Technology campus at Grangegorman and onwards to the large residential area of Cabra.  It will have 13 stops, with eight in the core city centre area, and the route passes along some key streets in the city, including Dawson Street, College Green, O'Connell Street and Parnell Street, which really comprise the spine of the city.  The optimum way to build such a line through a city centre with least effect on businesses and residents is through a series of enabling contracts that prepare the way for a main infrastructure contract, which then can be carried out as expeditiously as possible.  The principal enabling contracts include cellar investigation and infilling works, which have been successfully completed and more than 330 cellars have been infilled, as well as the removal, repair and storage of items of heritage value that are in the way of the scheme.  Such items will be replaced and put back after the scheme is ready and complete.  In addition, these contracts include the diversion of the many underground utilities from the path of the Luas tracks.  The utilities contract is under way at the moment, having started in January.  Anybody in the city will have seen the presence of work sites from St. Stephen's Green northwards and they are all due for completion in the third quarter of 2015.  There will be a rolling programme of such sites through the city.  Maintaining pedestrian and traffic movements and the frequency and reliability of public bus services have been central principles in planning the works.  There is a traffic forum involving the National Transport Authority, Dublin City Council, the Railway Procurement Agency, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin Bus, which meets regularly to plan and review progress.  The utilities contract under way at present is a target cost contract, that is, a contractual structure that incentivises the contractor to complete the works as expeditiously as possible and to work collaboratively with the client and which is a kind of gain-share contract.<br\/>We have put in place a comprehensive communications structure for the project.  In 2013, we appointed a specialist communications director to develop and lead the engagement with the public and all the relevant interests in the city.  This had not been done previously for this type of project and many communication channels are now in play.  For example, we have a dedicated website, <i>luascrosscity.ie<\/i>, supported by a freefone service, information e-mail, Twitter and Facebook.  In addition, there are liaison officers on the ground in daily engagement with contractors, retailers and businesses and who deal with all the local issues.  There could be a cone in the wrong place, a sign misplaced or something like that.  We issue flyers, use e-mail, have built together a big database of interested parties, send letters and use social media and advertisements.  We also opened a public information office in a unit off Dawson Street in 2013, where the liaison officers are based with the communications team.  The idea was to have a drop-in centre that supported the electronic and print media and that would give a public face to the scheme.  There also are many meetings with business representatives and all key stakeholders.  I will add that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, personally chairs a regular meeting on the project to ensure all the interests are aligned.<br\/>The main infrastructure contract, which is the one in which one will see the rails being laid, was issued for tender in April and it is anticipated that this contract will be awarded in December 2014.  This is a design and build contract and therefore, in the early months after December the contractor will be finalising the design for the works, after which the main works will commence on the street in 2015.  The project will be completed in 2017 and it is planned that the new Luas services will commence in October 2017 following a period of satisfactory testing and commissioning.  The railway order of An Bord Plean&aacute;la approving the scheme omitted a northbound stop on Dawson Street.  Consequently, were one coming across the city heading northwards towards O'Connell Street, one would not have a stop on Dawson Street, as objections were raised at the time.  In 2013, we engaged engineering consultants to review this again and to consult the businesses on the street and their representative groups to ascertain whether a location for a stop could be found.  I am pleased to say that a stop location has been identified that we think meets all the needs of the businesses and the travelling public and a railway order application for that stop will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the next week or so.  Finally, the European Investment Bank has provided significant financial backing for Luas cross city via a loan of &euro;150 million to the State.<br\/>The second topic concerns plans for transport infrastructure and the NTA manages three programmes for investment in public transport infrastructure.  One is in the greater Dublin area.  This area spans both the four Dublin local authorities and counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The programme is of the order of &euro;150 million per annum and covers all the modes, namely, rail, bus and light rail, as well as covering traffic management, cycling and walking.  The authority also manages a programme for the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  This programme is of the order of &euro;14 million per annum and covers bus, rail, traffic management, cycling and walking investment.<br\/>We also manage a transport accessibility programme across the State for those who are mobility impaired.  This programme is of the order of &euro;1.5 million per annum.  In this context, any design or infrastructure we put into the other programmes is made appropriate for those whose mobility is impaired, but the smaller transport accessibility programme is a targeted programme for additional features.<br\/>Approximately 40% of the State's population and economic activity is in the greater Dublin area, and public transport is critically important for the efficient movement of people.  Consequently, we are required under legislation to prepare long and short-term plans for the region.  Our implementation plan for 2013 to 2018 was statutorily approved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in January of this year and it guides all that we do in respect of our objectives and outputs for the greater Dublin region.  I have included a table in my note that sets out the investment plan.  Broadly, one could say it involves &euro;150 million per annum, amounting to approximately &euro;900 million over the period, and distributed across bus, light rail, heavy rail and traffic and sustainable transport, which are getting &euro;215 million, &euro;285 million, &euro;136 million and &euro;246 million, respectively.<\/p> <p>Each year we fund in excess of 200 projects.  This year we are getting to the order of 300 projects in this programme, which ranges from small cycling schemes up to the biggest scheme, which is Luas cross city.  I will give a broad outline of the projects to be developed out to 2018.<\/p><p> On the bus side, we will invest in the bus fleet that is providing subsidised services to achieve an average age of less than seven years.  This programme also covers investment in the Bus &Eacute;ireann coach fleet and its regional cities fleet that is providing subsidised services.  We will develop the quality bus corridor network and increase prioritisation for buses at traffic signals.  We will develop a coach parking facility close to Dublin city centre for commuter and tour buses and coaches when not in use.  Anybody familiar with the city will be aware that there are many coaches parked in the city, having discharged the visitors, and they could park elsewhere and free up the space.  We will improve bus stops - there is a big need for that - with new-style bus poles and better information panels.  We will progress the design and planning of three bus rapid transit projects: Swords-the airport to the city centre; Blanchardstown to UCD; and Clongriffin on the north-east sector of the city to Tallaght.  We hope that we will have started improvement works on the bus rapid transit route from Swords to the city centre within the period of the plan.  Regarding light rail, essentially, we will complete the construction of Luas cross city.<\/p><p> The key new project for heavy rail will be the opening up of the Phoenix Park tunnel to commuter train services from the Kildare rail line.  If one is coming up from the south west and southern stations, the train terminates at Heuston Station.  The opening of the tunnel will allow such trains not to stop at Heuston and carry through Drumcondra, Connolly, Tara, Pearse and Grand Canal stations to the heart of the city.  We are investing in city centre re-signalling to create the extra train paths through Connolly Station to allow the tunnel services to operate.<\/p><p> The traffic and sustainable transport projects will be many and varied.  Given their size, they tend to be small-scale projects.  The biggest single element will be the gradual delivery of a safer and better cycle network across the region.<\/p><p> All of the above are the immediate plans within the constraints of the current national capital investment plan.  Of course, we are planning for a longer-term programme.  To underpin our analytical work for a 20-year plan, we are carrying out two major studies this year.  First, we are looking at all the options for serving the fast growing Fingal local authority area and its main town of Swords.  Fingal experienced population growth of 14% between the census of 2006 and 2011 compared with the figure of 8% for the State.  Without appropriate public transport capacity, Fingal will be severely constrained in terms of both residential and economic expansion.  We have just commissioned a major engineering review of bus, light rail and heavy rail options for serving that area and we expect to complete that by early next year.<\/p><p> Separately, we are carrying out a detailed business case for the DART underground project.  That is a high capacity tunnel link that would interconnect the coastal rail line from Greystones to Balbriggan with the Kildare rail line coming in from the west, allowing a DART network to run from Balbriggan to Hazelhatch and from Maynooth to Greystones, with interchange and new stops in the city centre.  The last business case for that was done in 2010 and was based on the 2006 census, and we want to update that business case and the pricing of it.<\/p><p> The most important factor in the long-term planning of infrastructure for the Dublin region will be the availability of State funds in the period beyond 2020 and also the feasibility of the public private partnership model to draw in debt and equity funding from private parties.  These matters will become clearer in the coming years.  Currently, there is a Government investment review.  From demographic and economic projections, additional rail capacity will be needed in the future.  However, finding the solutions that are fundable will be the focus of our work in the coming year.<\/p><p> I mentioned I would cover the other cities.  Regarding Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, the next five years will see a continuation of current patterns.  In 2013, approximately &euro;14.5 million was distributed across 59 different projects.  The split of funding, as between bus, walking-cycling, traffic management and other, is shown in the presentation.<\/p><p> Each city will continue with improvements to bus priority while we will invest further in real time information, which is our national project, and will commence a programme of bus stop improvements in the cities, all to grow bus modal share.  The signs are good.  I would point out that bus passenger numbers increased in 2013: in Galway city, by 9.3%, and in Cork city, by 8.2%.  That followed on from rises of 7.2% and 1.9% in Galway and Cork, respectively, in 2012.  Also, Cork, Galway and Limerick will have public bike schemes operational in the autumn of this year.  As the committee will be aware, we secured sponsorship from Coca-Cola for those schemes.<\/p><p> In Cork city, investment over the coming years will focus on the city centre and a limited number of key bus and cycling corridors linking the city centre with the county metropolitan area.  Regarding Cork county within the metropolitan area, it is intended to concentrate investment in Douglas which has a population of nearly 18,000, one of the strategic areas identified by the local authority, rather than dilute the investment programme on a widely dispersed basis.<\/p><p> In Galway, a large number of walking and cycling improvements are planned along with further developing the bus prioritisation enhancements that have been implemented in the city.  Galway has a transportation unit which is well placed to plan all of this.  Also, at present there is a good walking share in Galway city and this, with the public bikes scheme, will greatly enhance the cycling aspect of transport there.<\/p><p> Limerick city has been designated as a smarter travel demonstration area by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is receiving substantial funding for sustainable travel projects.  The fund that we administer will be used for complementary bus priority and for cycling and pedestrian safety schemes that are not included in the Department's separate programme.  We will liaise closely with the Department on that.<\/p><p> In Waterford, bus related investment will be on improvements to the key corridors to the city centre, to Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, the industrial zone and employment area to the west of the city, and Waterford General Hospital, which are the key nodes of transport and the key employers.  Cycling routes will also be developed.  Waterford is also a city that can support cycling well because of its scale.<\/p><p> The accessibility grant funds I mentioned will be used in the main to improve access to bus and rail stations and to grant aid wheelchair accessible taxis, which is a new initiative we will announce today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403685600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy and Mr. Creegan for the presentation.  I welcome the progress that is being made.  The link up between Cabra and St. Stephen's Green is important.  I am glad to see that Dawson Street is being included because that would be handy for the likes of myself, from Broombridge, parking in Cabra and making my way here.  That is a good development.  Mr. Murphy mentioned business and tourism will not be affected and it should create 800 jobs.  Is that figure accurate?  I accept there will be spin-offs, in terms of other shops.<\/p><p>  One of the big issues for me is taxi ranks, particularly in O'Connell Street, such as the Gresham Hotel rank.  Has the NTA come to a decision with the local authority to put a rank on O'Connell Street?  Whether on either side of the street, even it wraps around the corner and comes onto O'Connell Street, it is important there is a taxi presence for the drivers.  I note the suggestion the rank could go down by the side of Clerys, or somewhere like that, and bring it around the corner.  Has the NTA looked at that?<\/p><p>  On the bus rapid transit service Mr. Murphy mentioned, there was considerable consultation on the project itself.  There is a second round of consultation.  Perhaps he could tell us when that will take place because I would be interested in looking at that in terms of the airport issue.  Mr. Murphy will recall that Metro north was one of the big issues in my area and this is now replacing that project.  I want to get a feel for it.<\/p><p>  The Phoenix Park tunnel has been mentioned for years and we are only getting back to it now.  I do not know how many presentations I got over the years about the Phoenix Park tunnel that has been ideal.  Can Mr. Murphy give us a rundown on it?  What type of service will it provide?<\/p> <p>Will it be heavy rail and how will it link up?  I would like to hear about that.<\/p><p> Passenger numbers on buses have increased dramatically in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Dublin Bus is recruiting drivers, which is very welcome.  Quite a few have been recruited and there are to be more.  That this is occurring makes me more annoyed about the putting out to tender of routes in the near future.  I refer to the 10% plan.  Literally 100% of services in Waterford city will have been put to tender.  Mr. Murphy will say the existing bus service in Waterford can tender but with the progress being made on bus numbers, I completely disagree with the whole trend.<\/p><p> What is the position on parking and loading bays for businesses along O'Connell Street?  Will there be further curtailment of ordinary traffic on the street, thereby affecting the flow of taxis?  Will buses be curtailed further on the street?  I want to get a picture of how this will be handled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500004#D00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403686200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I will answer everything except the question on the taxi ranks, which will be handled by Mr. Creegan, who is intimately involved in the project and who managed the taxi regulation.<\/p><p>  With regard to jobs, the figure of 800 was related to the construction period.  It was not a case of any spin-off economic benefit in the city.  The figure would still be a robust figure.  It represented all the contractors, subcontractors, labour suppliers, providers, designers, etc.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is quite right that the next stage for bus rapid transit is public consultation.  It will probably be in late September for the Swords-city centre route, in respect of which we have finalised what we believe will be the corridor.  We have dealt with all the issues raised at the last consultation.  The Blanchardstown-UCD route will be dealt with in December, and the Clongriffin-Tallaght route will not be addressed until next year.<\/p><p>  With regard to bus services and tendering, the Deputy mentioned recruitment by Dublin Bus.  When we spoke about 10%, we felt there would be growth in the market and that the impact on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann would be such that the growth would limit any losses if they were not to win the 10%.  That is starting to materialise now and I am very pleased there is further growth in passenger numbers this year.<\/p><p>  We have some indicative service patterns for the Phoenix Park tunnel.  What we could do is take two of the services that currently terminate in Heuston and run them through to the city centre.  We could add in two more services.  The indicative pattern at present is that there could be four services per hour running through from the Kildare rail line not only to the city centre but also to Grand Canal Dock.  There has been a big shift in employment to the latter area, which is now a considerable area of employment.  People have a desire to get there.  The proposal would greatly grow the numbers on the line.  We believe the cost of running the additional service will be met by revenue and that the passengers would get a much better service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403686200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Is the tunnel in good shape?

The tunnel is in very good condition.  Only minor works are needed on it and trains go through it at present.  The track itself was renewed in 1998.  At a maximum, we have &euro;12 million to spend overall on the line to get it ready for passenger services.  It is in very good condition.<\/p><p>  With regard to businesses, loading and parking, when the cross-city Luas is operational, the economic life of the city will be able to carry on, as planned.  Businesses and the retail sector can be served and car parks can be accessed.  There will be appropriate traffic movement to allow that, in addition to appropriate loading movements.  With regard to buses on O'Connell Street, there is no doubt that we must examine the service patterns of Dublin Bus to 2017.  There is no point in having buses replicate the exact same service that the cross-city Luas will provide.  When the green and red Luas lines were installed, there was a reconfiguration of bus services to match that.  Ultimately, the service offering will be better for the public but it may be that people will use light rail rather than bus services for certain routes.  One of the challenges in Dublin is not the radial services into the city centre but the fact that we had to make some cuts to services to peripheral local areas around Dublin.  These are services we would like to reintroduce.  The orbital services around Dublin are actually the ones that require a lot of growth.<\/p><p>  I will hand over to Mr. Creegan, who will talk about taxi ranks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500005#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403686200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>In regard to the taxi rank on O'Connell Street, known as the Gresham rank, the arrangements for its replacement when Luas cross-city becomes operational in 2017 comprise an open issue.

Some of the options include exactly what the Deputy suggested, a feeder rank on Cathal Brugha Street feeding onto a short rank on O'Connell Street close to the Gresham Hotel.

The main reason we invited them here is to discuss the city centre Luas works.  However, there are wider issues to be discussed also.  This is a good opportunity to discuss them.  With regard to the Luas construction around College Green and on to Nassau Street, we are really contemplating a city centre construction site.  I live in Raheny and travel across the city every day.  Frequently I travel through the corridor in question.  It is very problematic for pedestrians because the construction worker is actually on the footpaths also.  There are very narrow passageways and barriers.  A pedestrian needs to be quite wide awake when walking between College Green and Nassau Street.  There are many tourists around and it may be confusing for them.  Therefore, I am concerned about the safety aspect of the works.  I am also concerned about the timescale for completion.<\/p><p>  I was interested in what the delegation had to say about the construction of the Luas track down Dawson Street.  Originally, it was proposed that there would be no Luas stop there for people going to the northside.  As someone who lives on the northside, I believe that would be unacceptable.  I am glad to see the delegates are working on determining the location for a stop.  I do not know why somebody would have objected to one.  I believe it would be in the interest of the commercial traders in the area to have a stop at the location originally proposed.  I am glad this has been resolved.<\/p> <p> I am glad to see that with the opening of the Rosie Hackett Bridge much of the pressure has been relieved, but only buses, cyclists and pedestrians cross the bridge.  It does not have an impact on any other traffic trying to get around the city.<\/p><p> The Dublin City Manager is talking about extra cycle lanes on the quays.  I am not opposed to cycle lanes because they encourage people to cycle, but I question the timing of having two cycle lanes on the quays when all of the other work is ongoing, including Luas construction work in particular.  Whether we like it or not, there will be disruption for some time into the future; it would be better, therefore, to do one thing at a time.  I am not sure if Mr. Murphy has a role in that regard, but I question the timing.  <\/p><p> Mr. Murphy also raised the issue of rapid transit projects, including the Clongriffin to Tallaght route.  Clongriffin is in my constituency and there is a bus service towards Tallaght.  When the rapid transit project is implemented, will it mean an increased frequency of traffic?  There is also a DART station in Clongriffin, but many people who use it complain about the frequency of services and the fact that not all trains stop there.  It is a continuous local issue and people would find it more convenient if services were more frequent.  However, others will need to use the bus service and one complements the other.<\/p><p> Mr. Murphy referred to heavy rail and the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel.  It is a long time since I travelled in a train through the tunnel, but I understand it is used by engines and coaches.  It would be interesting if Mr. Murphy could arrange to bring members of the committee through it.  As there are concerns about the condition of tunnel, perhaps a trip through it might be organised some day.  <\/p><p> A heavy rail link with the airport from Howth Junction has been mooted a number of times.  Irish Rail has made a number of proposals in that regard, but I do not think the project has reached approval stage.  People living in Swords are concerned that if it were to go ahead, they would not have a metro service, but I do not see how one would exclude the other.  Most international airports are served by mainline rail systems linked with the capital city.  It would make sense, therefore, to have a mainline rail connection at Dublin Airport with links with Cork, Belfast, Galway and elsewhere.  I would like to know Mr. Murphy's views on this suggestion.<\/p><p> Mr. Murphy also referred to the Luas.  The number of accidents is a source of concern.  There have been a number of serious accidents in the Abbey Street-O'Connell Street area.  Recently there was a fatal accident when a car collided with a Luas tram.  It went up on the footpath and a woman who happened to live in my constituency was killed.  Are motorists failing to take care at traffic lights or is the current traffic light system insufficient to warn motorists of the dangers if they try to crash red lights when a tram is coming?  In the recent O'Connell Street case, the inquiry found that the driver of the Luas tram had been at fault.  This raises the question of how much safety training drivers receive.  It is unacceptable that such accidents can happen, especially given the number of passengers on a Luas tram.  On one occasion, when a Luas tram collided with a bus, a number of passengers on the bus were injured.  There continues to be a safety problem, particularly in the Abbey Street-O'Connell Street area where there are many pedestrians.

Bus companies make a great input in the movement of people throughout the city.  They travel all routes all of the time and their drivers notice where the pinch points and danger spots are.  We feed this information back to the contractors and the RPA.  We ensure visibility for drivers, particularly where there are hoardings.<\/p><p>  We have a big role to play in providing extra cycle lanes.  Essentially, we fund all cycle lanes in the city and have a cycle plan.  Cyclists need greater safety, particularly in the core city area.  We have to develop this option, but nothing will come to fruition and reach construction before the Luas project has been completed.  If we were to do such work, it would probably be at the extremities, not in the city centre core.  We have yet to decide on the final plan along the quays.<\/p><p>  There will be an increased frequency with the rapid bus transit system.  The purpose of the investment in the Clongriffin area is to have a four to five minute bus frequency rate.  <\/p><p>  I will examine the question raised by the Deputy concerning the DART, including stoppage patterns at Clongriffin and users' needs there.  I will correspond on the matter separately through the committee because I do not know enough about it.<\/p><p>  It would be a good idea for members of the committee to take a trip through the Phoenix Park tunnel because it would assuage fears they might have.  It would also show them what a great facility that direct link could provide.  We will talk about arranging a visit for members of the committee.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the heavy rail spur to the airport from Howth Junction.  I referred to a comprehensive study of the north Fingal area, including Swords and the airport.  It will include an examination of the heavy rail spur, as well as the old metro north corridor.  It will also look at extending the Luas cross-city or any other light rail solution, as well as the role of the rapid bus transit system.  We will, therefore, look at the gamut of possible projects, with nothing being ruled out at this stage.  Because of the extent of the work involved, however, it will take up to January 2015 to complete.  <\/p><p>  The reasons for the accidents at Luas-bus interfaces are multifaceted.  As regards the level of awareness of drivers at Luas signals, the Deputy will know about the launch of a new campaign to make drivers aware of the safety implications and the need not to break lights.  The campaign was launched in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority.  There have already been 100,000 hits on the YouTube video, which reflects a remarkable level of interest.  It is not the only tool one should use, but we are all trying to find ways of getting the message across to take as much care as possible when travelling through the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403686800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Murphy respond to the point about the Dawson Street Luas stop?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500006#F00300","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403686800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>On why people objected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403686800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500006#F00500","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403686800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Creegan to answer that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500006#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403686800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>People have different concerns.

Is compensation due to the owners of premises whose cellars have been filled in, or does it involve a compulsory fill-in order <i>per se<\/i>?

In doing something, we must ensure we keep traffic and bus movements working in the city.  The challenge is to find the right scheme.  We have four schemes in play.  We ran them over the last year in consultation with business groups, garda&iacute; and the bus operators to establish whether we could refine them.  We have the four and will engage in public consultation on them this year so that the public can see the challenges we face.  There is no easy solution, but we cannot do nothing.  That is what we have to do, but I take the Senator's point.<\/p><p>  The operators of both the Luas and the DART lines operate a security programme.  They have security officers and drivers have phone links back to base, as well as relationships with the Garda.  Sometimes problems arise despite all of these arrangements.  It is something of which the operators are keenly aware.  Particularly on the Luas, a great deal of intervention took place and security was increased on one line for a period in the early days when it opened.  That was very successful.

It is easier for someone to pickpocket and escape on the Luas.  Is the operator intensifying its efforts in this area?  It is bad publicity when a tourist is robbed coming to Dublin.

We are trying to design the lanes and the stops so that the general bus movement will be there, but bus rapid transit will be able to operate at a higher frequency with fewer stops, thereby passing by buses which are pulled in at existing stops.  The concern that has been raised is not a real one, therefore.  I hope we will be able to get that across to them.<\/p><p>  On the &euro;65 million out to 2018, as with any construction project, one will have a tail payment - that is, the final release of payments on satisfaction with the project.

The budget for that is approximately &euro;100 million per annum, or &euro;500 million over the relevant five-year period.  One must look at the total transport sector and infrastructure taking account of that.  We would like the regional cities programme to grow.  The local authorities are particularly motivated to consider the options now, including bus, cycling and walking.  We will be able to make a strong case to the Government that we should increase the programme.  A key thing for rural Ireland is the subsidy for services.  That is what keeps lightly used services on the ground and available to people.  It is almost more important than infrastructure, in fact, and it is one programme we want to protect.

I was at another meeting.  I was glad to see when I was coming in that Mr. Murphy was flying the flag for rural Ireland.  I will return to an issue I have raised here previously.  It looks like I will continue to raise it.  I have now become something of a lightning conductor for people who have clear evidence that the small public service vehicles, SPSV, knowledge test is away with the fairies.  It is the best example of a test that is designed for people to fail.  If the leaving certificate curriculum was like the current SPSV knowledge test, there would be national uproar.  I know of somebody who was asked a question in the knowledge test that related to which street a pub was located on.  The pub in question closed down six years ago and there is no pub of that name in the city of Limerick.  I have asked about this issue here previously and it seems, as a previous occupant of this House said, to be like playing handball against a haystack.  The ball never comes back.<\/p><p>  I genuinely believe that the knowledge test for SPSVs - people trying to drive hackneys in limited rural areas - is an absolute farce.  It is designed for people to fail.  I will not be convinced otherwise until such time as the knowledge test reflects the area in which the person operates.  Again, I will use the example of the town of Abbeyfeale.  If people are looking to get a hackney licence anywhere between the villages of Glin through Athea and down into Abbeyfeale, they will not be asked anything about Knocknagoshel, Duagh, Lixnaw or anywhere in the Listowel area but they will be asked about places 50 or 60 miles way from them in Doon, Oola and Kilbeheny, which is practically beside Mitchelstown - areas where they will never take up a fare.  The answer I am constantly being given is that they can apply for the rural hackney licence, which is a very limited licence that is not the same thing.  It is not a hackney licence as we would know it.  <\/p><p>  Why is there an absolute aversion to testing people on the area they are going to serve rather than an area we know they will not serve?  I know of no hackney drivers in the west Limerick area being called into Limerick city to collect fares and drop people off.  If the NTA could show me an example of a hackney driver from Abbeyfeale, Mountcollins or Newcastle West who is receiving calls from Limerick city to drop people off there, I would accept the validity of knowing which direction the traffic in Roches Street runs.  However, until such time as someone can actually show me that this system is fit for purpose, I think it is absolutely ludicrous.  God help people down in Goleen, Schull or Allihies who are trying to pass the Cork knowledge test because they will be asked about places in Fermoy, Mitchelstown or Kilworth.  People are half way to Dublin when they are in Fermoy on the way from Goleen but they are expected to have knowledge about it.  It is absolutely ludicrous.  When are we going to arrive at a situation where a person is tested on the functional area rather than on this notional area of a county?  We have seen in the Local Government Reform Act 2014 how notional areas of counties can disappear.  South Tipperary has disappeared so now a person in Newcastle in south Tipperary on the Waterford border is expected to know about places up near Birr, Riverstown and Borrisokane.  These places are over 100 miles away.  What are we going to do about it?<\/p><p>  With the greatest respect, I do not think that the halfway house rural hackney licence is the solution because it is a limiting licence.  It is basically saying to people that we know there is a problem, we know there are not enough hackneys in the area and we know that we are putting a knowledge test in front of them that they will never be able to pass so rather than change the knowledge test and examine the person on an area they will cover, we will go to a halfway house.  I do not think that is acceptable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500008#H00500","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403688000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I would hate Deputy O'Donovan to get the idea that we are not listening to what he is saying because he has raised valid points.

I know of five people with offers of jobs at the moment but who cannot accept them because they have been asked in knowledge tests about which street a certain pub in Limerick is located on when that pub has been closed for the past six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500008#H01600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1403688000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>That point is well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014062500008#H01700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1403688000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Due to the fact that the NTA is Dublin-based, it tends to see all that is going on there.

Have we any information that could be sent up?  What proposals are needed for Cork, Limerick, etc., because I would like to have a look at them?
