This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The Government has no plans to change this policy.  In fact, the Government increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00. <\/p>  <p>  This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are also payments for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. <\/p>  <p>  Core pension rates have not been reduced in the life of this Government, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending.  The same period has seen considerable deflation which has protected core pension rates in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty.  CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65. <\/p>  <p>  The recovery has also allowed us some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas Bonus benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total. <\/p>  <p>  Any decision to increase pension rates would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100057#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":121,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100057#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[22782\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100057#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the assistance she will provide in respect of a family (details supplied) in Dublin 15 which faces homelessness due to rent supplement limits being lower than the market rates.","asker":"1195","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>Officials from the Department have been engaging with the person concerned to resolve the situation that he and his family find themselves in.

The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people, who become unemployed, in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.  There are additional planned measures that have not yet been fully implemented.  Those under 18 are offered second chance education, e.g., through Youthreach.<\/p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee national roll-out will progress throughout 2015. There will be flexibility to tailor approaches to meet local conditions.  The specific approach to be followed in each area will be a matter for local DSP management working together with relevant stakeholders, including employer groups, community groups and training providers.  It is expected that this approach will be informed by the lessons learned from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee project, rather than requiring further pilot exercises.<\/p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee is focused in the first instance on the young unemployed in receipt of jobseekers payments, and involves the conditionality related to such payments in respect of jobsearch, availability for work, and willingness to take up appropriate offers of employment or opportunities on training and temporary employment programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Young people in receipt of non-Live Register payments (for example lone parents and people with disabilities) are entitle to benefit from the full range of services and programmes that are available to those on job-seekers' payments.

The application of the tax is heavily dependant on the regulatory regime for coal put in place by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2011.  This regulatory regime establishes higher environmental standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland, and provides for enforcement of those standards by the local authorities.\u00a0 Suppliers who produce or supply solid fuels in contravention of the coal regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State agencies charged with preventing such supply.

The fact that this Government has maintained such a progressive and redistributive\u00a0tax and social welfare system during one of the most difficult fiscal consolidations in the history of the State demonstrates its\u00a0commitment to equality and fairness.

and<\/p><p>- secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.<\/p><p>We make sure that we review the few incentives that we have on a regular basis to ensure value for money for the Irish taxpayer.\u00a0 An example of this is the review of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit which took place in 2013.\u00a0 This review found that the tax credit meets these objectives, and is important for supporting jobs and innovation in Ireland.<\/p><p>In order to ensure the proper evaluation of such reliefs on an on-going basis, the Department of Finance developed and published new guidelines for the Evaluation of Tax Expenditures which can be viewed at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[22882\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his estimate of the amount of revenue that would be raised for every 0.1% increase, up to a 2% increase, of Stamp Duty added to the rate payable on share transactions.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer for each increase of 0.1% on the current 1% Stamp Duty on share transactions, by reference to the expected 2015 outturn, is estimated to be in the region of an additional &euro;38 million. \u00a0This is calculated on a straightline basis and the estimated yields from the increases of 0.1% up to 2% as suggested by the Deputy are shown in the table.<table><tr><th>% Increase<\/th><th>Additional Revenue &euro;M<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0.1<\/td><td>38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.2<\/td><td>76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.3<\/td><td>114<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.4<\/td><td>152<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.5<\/td><td>190<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.6<\/td><td>228<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.7<\/td><td>266<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.8<\/td><td>304<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0.9<\/td><td>342<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>380<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.1<\/td><td>418<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.2<\/td><td>456<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.3<\/td><td>494<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.4<\/td><td>532<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.5<\/td><td>570<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.6<\/td><td>608<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.7<\/td><td>646<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.8<\/td><td>684<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1.9<\/td><td>722<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>760<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD04900"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[22907\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review the registration thresholds for value added tax in view of an anomaly where a business selling physical goods can earn &euro;75,000 before having to register for VAT but a service business can only earn &euro;37,500 before having to register;

Indeed, I note that the ESRI in\u00a0its Summer Quarterly Economic Commentary\u00a0published yesterday\u00a0confirms\u00a0it too expects a 2015 headline deficit of 2.3 per cent, well\u00a0inside the 3 per cent of GDP ceiling.<\/p><p>From 2016 onwards, the public finances in Ireland will therefore\u00a0be subject to the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP.  The European Commission assesses compliance with the requirements of the preventive arm on the basis of two complimentary pillars.  First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.  The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are in theory designed to be complementary, although differences between the two metrics can emerge from time-to-time.<\/p><p>The IFAC\u00a0noted that the fiscal projections contained in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the SGP; in other words, that the improvement in our structural balance is below the required 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2016.<\/p><p>However, SPU estimates show that for Ireland compliance with the expenditure benchmark pillar is consistent with delivering a\u00a0lower suggested quantum of structural adjustment in 2016. \u00a0This somewhat counterintuitive outcome was explicitly addressed in the SPU, and emphasises the problems posed by some of the technical aspects of the rules.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that compliance with the requirements of the SGP is ultimately assessed on the basis of analysis undertaken by the European Commission.  In this context, the recent of the SPU published by the European Commission as part of the European Semester process finds that 'on the basis of information in the 2015 Stability Programme Update re-calculated according to the common methodology, progress towards the MTO is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the [Stability and Growth] Pact'.  The assessment by the Commission also\u00a0finds that\u00a0'the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar'.<\/p><p>In summary, therefore, the projections in the SPU are consistent with the requirements of the SGP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[22922\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if projections for the deficit for 2017 and subsequent years in the Spring Economic Statement and the Stability Programme Update 2015 are based on anticipated neutral budgets post-2016, or if they incorporate promised tax and expenditure measures of up to &euro;1.5 billion per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[22926\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100058#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected deficit in 2016, 2017 and 2018 on a no-policy-change basis and, separately, based on policies envisaged by the Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 90 together.<\/p>  <p>  As stated in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) and the Spring Economic Statement (SES), the 2016 forecast reflects a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion, evenly split between revenue and expenditure measures. \u00a0If this &euro;1.2 billion package was not implemented, this would improve the general government deficit ratio, on a straight line basis, by about 0.6% of GDP, from 1.7% of GDP to 1.1% of GDP.

The fiscal projections contained in the SES and the Stability Programme Update (SPU) are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion in 2016, split evenly between expenditure increases and tax reductions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Post 2016, the fiscal forecasts included in the SES and the SPU, and all related general government expenditure ratios, reflect a no-policy-change scenario from an expenditure perspective, other than provision being made for a &euro;300 million increase in gross voted expenditure per annum to offset demographic pressures.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This no-policy change scenario would result in the pace of structural adjustment in the period 2017 to 2020 significantly exceeding the minimum annual rate of greater than 0.5 per cent of GDP required under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).\u00a0 However, it is the Government's\u00a0firm intention - stated clearly in the SES -\u00a0to make only the minimum adjustment required under the rules of the SGP in these years, which means that additional fiscal space\u00a0will be available.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the application of this fiscal space will fall to be taken each year, as part of the Budget,\u00a0taking\u00a0account of the prevailing economic conditions and\u00a0Government's commitments to investing in public infrastructure and services. As these resource allocation decisions are made by Government, the ratios in relation to general government expenditure will adjust accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The Medium Term Expenditure Framework, with multiannual ceilings, was introduced in 2011\u00a0during a period of significant fiscal consolidation and has been very successful in assisting Government to meet its fiscal targets each year.\u00a0 Working within this framework, the Government has been able to achieve its fiscal targets and also allocate\u00a0additional resources to areas of priority as these became available.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Medium Term Expenditure Framework operates within the broader context of the\u00a0SGP, in particular the Expenditure Benchmark.  The recent refinements in relation to the application of the Expenditure Benchmark now allow calculations of\u00a0the reference rate for potential expenditure growth to be updated annually.  This ensures that the rules take account of the most up-to-date outturn and outlook for potential GDP growth.  This change has resulted in some 0.4 per cent of GDP in additional fiscal space in 2016.  With an annual update to the Expenditure Benchmark reference rate, it is reasonable that the expenditure ceilings should be revised to take account of the most up-to-date data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100059#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100059#WRE02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Takeovers","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100059#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[22858\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100059#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent of his knowledge of a transaction (details supplied) prior to the completion of the transaction, which would arise in the ordinary course of his responsibilities as Minister in relation to such transactions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>After the acquisition was agreed by the parties involved, the Competition Authority received a notification on the 16<sup>th<\/sup>March 2012.

This figure, which includes the additional funding of &euro;35 million held by the Department of Health the details of which were finalised recently, represents 6.5% of the total health budget.  In relation to the 2006 percentage figure it is difficult to carry out a precise comparison, as performance and financial reporting prior to 2014 was done on a geographic basis as opposed to the current Directorate model.  However, it is estimated that it would have been approximately 7%.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;125m additional ring-fenced funding has been provided by the Government for mental health since coming into office.

Bearing in mind the many competing demands on both the wider Health budget and Exchequer funding generally, this represents a substantial ongoing commitment to our mental health services.<\/p><p>Historically, funding for the mental health services constituted a high proportion of overall health spend in Ireland.  In part, this reflected the traditional emphasis on an institutional model of service delivery with a clinical care focus. While funding may have been a higher than current percentage of 6.5%, much of this funding would have been spent on what was considered a staff-intensive and relatively expensive model of service.  In addition, historically other areas of the overall health budget in Ireland may not have received an adequate level of funding appropriate to a modern community-focussed health service.  This has been improved in recent times with, for example, greater investment in primary and community care areas, which also benefits people with mental health issues. <\/p><p>In line with <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, the HSE mental health service is now moving towards a more person-centred recovery model of care, with an increasing focus on community delivery.  This model of service is widely agreed to be more focussed on the needs of the service user in the first instance.  It is also considered to be more cost effective and aims for a planned greater integration of services across the primary and community care sectors over time.

If there is a cardiac 999 call in an area, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the site and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service and Rapid Response vehicles arrives.<\/p>  <p>  This national initiative provides an opportunity to extend care for cardiac events.

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme, a key component of our health service involves very significant financial commitment on the part of the State.  <\/p>  <p>  Once a person's application to the NHSS is approved they can choose to enter any approved nursing home that has an available bed and can cater for their care needs.  The applicant can choose a public, private or voluntary nursing home, and their level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home, regardless of the type of nursing home chosen or the cost of care. <\/p>  <p>  The price to be paid for the provision of care in both private nursing homes and section 39 voluntary nursing homes is negotiated facility by facility by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), and these agreed prices are the basis for the financial support payable by the HSE under the NHSS. The NTPF is independent in the performance of its function. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF has no role in setting or negotiating prices for public facilities.  The maximum prices to be paid in public facilities, and referred to as the cost of care, are set by the HSE and are published on the HSE website.  The cost for each public nursing home is determined using the definition of long-term residential care services underpinned by an agreed set of cost components which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100062#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[22865\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100062#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which young unemployed jobseekers continue to be considered for any vacancies that may occur at Crooksling Nursing Home in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to look into this matter and to respond to the Deputy directly.

Ministers agreed to continue to examine opportunities and progress in drawing down EU funding and that a further update on EU Funding Opportunities will be brought to the next Plenary meeting. <\/p>  <p>  The NSMC welcomed the approval of the INTERREG V programme by the European Commission and looked forward to the early finalisation of the PEACE IV programme.  Ministers welcomed the indications that good progress is being made towards reaching the joint target of &euro;175 million in terms of cross-border projects under the Horizon 2020 Programme, and noted the work of InterTradeIreland and the All-Island Steering Group in raising awareness of this &euro;80bn EU programme. <\/p>  <p>  Ministers discussed the Progress Report prepared by the NSMC Joint Secretaries on the work of the North South Bodies and in the other NSMC areas for co-operation since the last Plenary meeting on 5 December 2014 in Armagh. <\/p>  <p>  The Council noted that the development of new priorities for North\/South cooperation was discussed at the NSMC Institutional meeting on 25 February 2015 and that 'new Sectoral Priorities' will be an agenda item at future Institutional meetings.  The Council noted the decision that was agreed at the NSMC Institutional meeting whereby Ministers would review their current Work Programmes and that endorsement of any changes will be sought at a future NSMC Plenary meeting. <\/p>  <p>  There was an extensive discussion on cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering.  Ministers noted the on-going efforts by the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions to tackle this criminal activity which affects the lives and well-being of people on both sides of the border.  The very detrimental environmental and health effects of fuel laundering were discussed and Ministers noted the introduction of the new fuel marker in both jurisdictions.  The Council recognised the importance of closer co-operation between agencies in tackling and combating cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering and agreed that the topic be revisited at a future meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The Council noted the continued engagement between officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister with stakeholders concerning the future development of the North West Gateway Initiative and the ongoing discussions on arrangements to hold a meeting of relevant Ministers on this in the North West.  The Council further noted the current work by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop new and collaborative cross-border arrangements at local government level to promote the development of the North West region, in cooperation with regional stakeholders and central governments. <\/p>  <p>  The Council noted that, in line with the decision taken at the NSMC Institutional Meeting on 25 February 2015, the NSMC Joint Secretariat has consulted with Sponsor Departments and with Board members of the North South Implementation Bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited regarding the proposal to extend the existing terms of appointment of Board Members for 12 months.  This consultation is currently ongoing.  The Council agreed that decisions on Board appointments will be made before the expiry of the current Board members' terms of office in December 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Ministers also noted the current position on setting up a North South Consultative Forum as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The Council approved a schedule of NSMC meetings proposed by the Joint Secretariat, including the next NSMC Plenary meeting in November 2015.   <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing, with my colleagues in Government, to pursue opportunities for further North\/South co-operation with the Northern Ireland Executive, particularly through the structures of the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00400"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[23490\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the annual cost of introducing a living wage or minimal-threshold gross salary of &euro;11.45 an hour in his Department and the bodies under his aegis.","asker":"1080","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The potential cost of introducing an hourly rate of &euro;11.45 per hour within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is calculated at approximately &euro;640,000 per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[22852\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061100063#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the action Bus &Eacute;ireann took in response to its own findings that 30% of the buses it contracts to the Department of Education and Skills to carry school children were faulty and dangerous;
