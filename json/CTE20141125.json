I will provide a brief general overview of the liquid milk sector in 2013, and the agency's chief executive, Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, will address in greater detail the contents of the annual report.<\/p><p>  The first slide provides an overview of the Irish dairy sector in 2013.  That was a record year despite adverse spring weather conditions and a fodder crisis.  Domestic milk supplies amounted to 5.42 million litres, an increase of 4% on 2012.<\/p> <p>It was a record year in terms of milk supply and composition.  Some 92% of the domestic milk supply is used in manufacturing milk for dairy products, while 8% is consumed in the domestic liquid milk market.  On the price side, the average producer price for manufacturing milk last year was the highest on record, representing an increase on the previous year of 7 cent per litre, or 22%.<br\/>The consumption of fresh milk in the domestic market is 563 million litres, an increase of 0.4% on 2012.  It is the largest consumer market for milk and milk products in the State.  The <i>per capita<\/i>consumption of 0.34 litres per day gives Ireland the second highest <i>per capita<\/i>consumption of liquid milk in the EU.  Some 74% of the market is supplied from domestic supplies, while 26% is supplied from imported milk in package and bulk form, imported from Northern Ireland and processed in the State.  Retailers distribute 79% of all fresh milk, catering distributes 11% and doorstep deliveries comprise about 10%.  On the retail side, about 55% of retail milk is own-label milk. <br\/>The average retail price of fresh milk in 2013 was 94 cent per litre, an increase of 1 cent per litre on 2012.  The average producer price for fresh liquid milk was 39 cent per litre, an increase of 5 cent per litre on 2012.  It can be noted that even though the retail price decreased, the producer price increased.  That is because the producer price for liquid milk is now mainly linked to monthly manufacturing prices for export, plus a winter premium.  The differential, however, between the average producer price for liquid milk and the producer price for manufacturing milk was less than 1 cent per litre, compared to a differential average over the past 19 years of 4 cent per litre.<br\/>The structure of the domestic fresh milk market in 2013 is highly concentrated at retailer, processor and producer level.  The five largest retail groups have a market share of 93%, and the three largest have a market share of 79%.  Retailers have about a 70% share of the milk market.  The five largest processors produce 91% of registered milk supplies, and of the 581 largest producers, 30% of the total number of registered producers supply 60% of registered milk supplies.<br\/>I refer to registered contracts and registered supplies in 2012 and 2013.  There were 1,883 registered producers with contracts in the State, representing 10% of all milk producers.  They supply 16% of domestic milk supplies.  The total milk supply from this source was 830 million litres for the year, of which 50% was for the liquid market and 45% was for manufacture.  From an agency point of view, the critical thing is the cover for domestic liquid milk consumption in the winter period; cover in the five prescribed months in 2012 and 2013 was 132%, while in the critical months of December and January, cover was 127%.<br\/>The next chart shows the milk supplies of registered producers and the contracts of active registered producers for the past 11 years.  It shows great stability in the liquid milk supply sector.  The average is around 827 million litres.  Liquid milk was about 449 million litres, or 55%, on average over that period, and manufacturing milk was 365 million litres, or 45%, on average.  The next slide shows that information in a graph.  It covers 2002-03 onwards and refers to the period from October to February.  We can see the cover for domestic liquid milk consumption.<br\/>There are references to the last item in the annual report.  We are within a few months of the abolition of EU milk quotas, which have been in vogue in Ireland since 1983.  It is an opportunity as well as a challenge, and is a completely transformational event for the Irish dairy industry.  The projected increase in domestic milk supplies by 2020 is 50%, all of which will be destined for export markets.  This will result in a sharp increase in volatility in milk prices for producers and will change the structure, scale and systems of milk production, processing and marketing in the State.  <br\/>Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will deal with the annual report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500003#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Denis Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416924300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will take the committee through the highlights of the annual report, with a particular focus on the level of contracts we have - that is, who is staying in the business to date, what the reduction has been, what prices have been like and a general overview of the activities of the agency over the past year.  Copies of the presentation have been circulated to the committee.<\/p><p>  The first graph refers to the classification of registered contracts by type.  The committee might wonder what that is all about.  There are two basic types of contract registered by the agency.  One is year-round, which means that producers will supply liquid milk on a year-round basis for 12 months of the year, which is different from those supplying manufacturers, who only supply it on a spring calving basis.  There are also contracts which last for some or all of the winter months - that is, October to February.  <\/p><p>  In the milk year 2012-13, to which the report relates, we had 1,769 year-round contracts registered.  In addition, there were 114 winter-months-only contracts.  As of the time of the last annual report, the number of people in the country engaged in liquid milk production stood at 1,883.  The issue in regard to that in the run-up to 2015 and the abolition of quotas is whether people will stay in the business.  They have the opportunity of choosing whether to go into total spring production, not bothering with liquid milk and moving into manufacturing milk, given that there will no longer be quotas.<\/p><p>  The next graph shows that when the agency was established approximately 3,000 contracts were registered.  When I first arrived I investigated how many contracts there were and whether the number stated was legitimate.  Upon examination, I found there was duplication of contracts, and some people had two or more.  We rationalised that in the first two years and the figure decreased to about 2,700 by 1998.  There has been a decline, but it has been in terms of numbers rather than volume of milk.  There are fewer people engaged in milk production, but the overall supply has remained pretty constant, which was shown in a graph in Mr. Murphy's presentation.  <\/p><p>  One of the things the Oireachtas empowered the agency to do was to decide whether to register contracts, and one of the requirements was that they provided sufficient compensation to people who were committed to the idea that they would calve not only in the spring but also in the autumn, working throughout the year in order that there would be milk available all year round.<\/p> <p>In order to cover that cost and to recognise the extra commitment involved, including the lifestyle commitment, the Oireachtas or the members of the agency would have to be satisfied that the price on the contract represented adequate compensation for the economic cost of winter milk production.  We are fulfilling that role.  The first column in the graph shows the liquid price since 1995, and the second column shows the manufacturing price, while the third column shows the difference in price.  The average differential over 19 years was 4.21 cent per litre.  There is quite a range within the figures.  The differential figure of 6 cent per litre for 1998 jumps out, as does the 0.8 cent per litre price differential for 2013.  The price differential has varied, but the average figure is 4.21 cent per litre.  The lowest differential was seen in last year's prices, but that is counterbalanced by its being the year with the highest price for milk generally, at 38.87 cent per litre for liquid milk.  Those figures will have changed for the current year.  <\/p><p> Prices vary under the contracts and different pricing systems.  For the winter months, which we are particularly interested in, the price is 39 cent per litre, while in the summer months the price is 35 cent per litre, giving an average price of 37.5 cent per litre.  That is roughly what happened in terms of prices for producers during the period covered by the annual report. <\/p><p> Mr. Murphy mentioned that there was a high degree of concentration at processor level.  Ten processors had supplies in the range of under 1 million litres to 20 million litres.  Three processors had supplies between 20 million and 40 million litres, while two processors had supplies of over 40 million litres.  These two processors are in a pivotal position in relation to the entire industry.  That is counterbalanced by the fact that the retail sector is also quite concentrated.  The numbers also show that the number of producers involved in the business is beginning to concentrate to some degree.  <\/p><p> The fact that there is milk available from Northern Ireland is another factor in the liquid milk business in Ireland.  When the agency was established, only bulk milk was imported.  In 1997, for example, 16 million litres of milk were imported into Ireland.  No packaged milk was imported.  The situation has been transformed over the last 15 years or so.  In 2013, 57 million litres of milk were imported in bulk, while 89 million litres were imported packaged.  This is a real change from the zero position which obtained in 1995.<\/p><p> The ratio of milk imports to liquid consumption may be seen.  Packaged milk is depicted in red, while bulk milk is depicted in blue.  The rise in the volume of packaged milk is clear.  The share of the domestic market for liquid milk that was being taken up by Northern Ireland imports packaged in bulk was 26%.  One in every four litres of milk consumed today in the Republic is produced outside the State.  The increase in the number of imports over time is shown as a histogram.  There has been a progression in the volume of imports, starting in 1995, which has reached a sizable share now.  Why has that occurred?  It may be because we are moving into a quota-free environment next year, but Northern Ireland has been operating in a quota-free environment since the very beginning.  This is because it has the availability of quota for the UK, which allows the possibility of unlimited production.  If one takes the base index level for the milk supplies available in Northern Ireland as being 100 for 1993, by 2013 it had increased to 153.  That milk has to go somewhere, and we know where it has gone.  <\/p><p> Grocery market shares are interesting, not only from the National Milk Agency's point of view but also from the point of view of what is going on generally in Ireland as regards retail matters.  If one looks at the number of retailers on the market, the category of \"all other\" retailers, which represented 17% of the market in 2003, represented 3% of the market in 2013, and it will probably be a smaller figure for 2014.  The independent corner shop has largely been wiped out over this period.  In one decade, its share has gone from 17% to 3%.  The top three retailers have a huge amount of control.  Tesco, Dunnes and SuperValu together constitute 70% of the grocery market.  This is not the liquid milk market; it is the grocery market.  However, it would be pretty much the same for the liquid milk market.  If a person is thinking of selling any product in Ireland in the grocery arena, there are three organisations that he or she must deal with to access 70% of the market.  That is particularly poignant when it comes to a product such as liquid milk, or any fresh product that is agricultural in nature, where there is a lot of risk.  The producers are very much in the hands of a very concentrated set of retail outlets.  That has an effect on prices, what the value chain looks like, confidence in the sector, how the producer perceives what value is to be had for its product and whether the product is looked on as a commodity product or a value-added product.  There are differing perspectives on this depending on what one is talking about and in relation to how milk is viewed in the State and in other countries around Europe.  <\/p><p> It must be remembered, when looking at the annual report of the agency and when having a general discussion on liquid milk, that while in Ireland and the UK we drink fresh milk, on the Continent it is not generally possible to get fresh milk.  It is a specialist consumer demand in that part of the world.  A person will not get fresh milk readily when having a cup of tea somewhere such as Spain.  This is a different product from ultra-high-temperature, UHT, processed milk, and that should be borne in mind when looking at the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416924900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Denis Murphy and An Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  I always find their reports very informative, clear and useful.  Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said in his presentation that the manufacturing price was now within 0.8 cent per litre of the liquid milk price.  The question I have on price - allowing for a likely volatility in the market which has been indicated by the ending of the quotas and so on - is whether the liquid milk price is likely to follow the manufacturing price, or is the similarity just coincidental?  Will it be more influenced by the availability of liquid milk from Northern Ireland?<\/p> <p>In other words, is this link to the manufacturing price just a temporary phase, or is the real determinant the availability and the price at which those in Northern Ireland are willing to sell milk?  Depending on the answer to that question, are we likely to get significant volatility in the price paid to liquid milk producers?  If there is significant volatility in the market, how will the National Milk Agency ensure there is a liquid milk supply in the winter, which I understand is the role of the agency?  Will it be possible to ensure there is a sufficient return for those in the liquid milk market who continue to produce liquid milk in winter so that the product is available?<\/p><p> What fascinates me is the fact that, although there is little or no difference between our climate and that of Northern Ireland, it has a much more even supply of milk across the whole sector.  There is much less seasonal difference in the level of production.  Is the open border likely to continue in the market into the future?  What is the reason for the greater level  of seasonal milk production in the South?  What is the more profitable system for manufactured milk as well as liquid milk?  Will that affect the National Milk Agency?  Would the need for the National Milk Agency continue if supply levels were constant throughout the year?<\/p><p> The labelling of milk was alluded to, but not in great detail.  I understand the National Dairy Council campaign was relatively successful.  The own-label goods allow the multiples or supermarket groups to switch supplier or processor very quickly and to use milk from both North and South without anybody knowing where the raw material is coming from.  That allows them more choice in terms of buying milk.  Having a NDC label, by definition, limits the market to the South.  My understanding is that the milk is the exact same quality and that there is no difference between milk from the North and milk from the South.  I understand that buying milk with a NDC label and paying a premium price for it does not give one a premium product.<\/p><p> My final point concerns the price paid to farmers.  We were given statistics previously, and when I get an opportunity to examine the NDC annual report in detail, I will have some indication of the percentage of the price of a litre of milk that goes to the primary producer.  On a previous occasion, the NDC indicated that the price of a litre of milk as it was in 1995 had decreased by 11% in the intervening years.  What is the view of the National Milk Agency on the concept of having an official observer at EU level, as they have in France, to inform the public of the cost breakdown of a litre of milk - in other words, the percentage that the farmer, the processor and the retailer get for a litre of milk?  This would establish over time whether the percentage going to the farmer is rising or falling and whether that change is justified in terms of increased costs in the various sectors.  It seem to me that the stability of farming depends on that information.  I understand that 55% of milk production goes to manufacturing and the remaining 45% is sold as liquid milk; is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500005#F00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416925500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Fifty-five percent is sold as liquid milk and 45% is used for manufacturing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1416925500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Is that the breakdown of all the milk produced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500006#G00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416925500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.

This was quite a successful year for dairy farmers in particular, as the price was much better than it has been for some time.<\/p><p>  What jumped out at me in the presentation was that the five largest retail groups have a market share of 93%, the five largest processors produce 91% of milk supplies and 581 producers provide 60% of milk supplies.  That indicates quite clearly that liquid milk is controlled by a small number of retailers and processors.  The 581 producers that are responsible for 60% of milk supplies are the largest producers and would be aware of the volatility in the market.  Does the fact that this is confined to a small number of retailing groups, processors and producers give cause for concern to Mr. Murphy and Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh?   We are told that price is determined by demand.  I think many of us would take exception to that, because in other sectors of farming, be it the beef sector or whatever, price is determined by the power of the multiples, the manufacturers or the processors.  At the end of the day, the producer - that is, the farmer - is a hostage to fortune.<\/p><p>  Are the witnesses concerned about the ending of the quota system and the expectation of volatility in the market as a consequence?  All else being equal, one would assume it would be okay.  As profit margins become more marginal, only the stronger and bigger producers will be able to survive.  That is a major concern in the area I come from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500006#G00600","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1416925500,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I must declare a conflict of interest in that I am one of the 1,769 year-round milk producers.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc organised a very interesting conference entitled \"Managing price volatility and expansion in a post-quota era\" last Wednesday in the Red Cow.  The buzzword for me was \"volatility\", because that is the way it will be in the future.<\/p><p>  What I thought was the most interesting part of today's presentation was the slide that showed the price of liquid milk in 1995, which was 29 cent per litre, and the fact that we are back to a similar price nearly 20 years later.  In 1995 the cost base was totally different from today's cost base.  In my opinion, it will not be viable to produce liquid milk in the future.<\/p><p>  Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke about UHT milk in Spain and other European countries.  We have had the advantage of producing fresh milk.<\/p> <p>We are going down the same road very fast.  It will not be possible after the quota ends, when numbers will increase and the cost of producing milk during winter will be far too high, to keep the industry sustainable.  I know many farmers in my area who are doing the same work as I have done and they will increase milk production off grass.  They will not produce milk from November to February at a very high cost, and that is where we will have a big problem going forward.  That is where there will be a big problem and it must be addressed.  It would be a sad day if we had to put UHT milk on our corn flakes in the morning, so it will be a big challenge after the ending of the quota.  There is a willingness to increase milk production but not at any cost.  When we increase milk production, it will be to scale; there will be more milk, the price will be more volatile and farmers will have to be more efficient.  The most efficient way of producing milk will be off grass and not during the winter.  That is the challenge for the National Milk Agency and the primary producers.<\/p><p> Another interesting statistic is that 25% of milk used is produced outside the State.  Are we importing 25% of what we use?  If so, it is a fairly startling statistic, as we are oversupplying milk.  Is it possible to address the issue or reduce the figure?  Has the figure been growing steadily over the past number of years?  The matter needs to be addressed, although it is not that I am against imports.  We are producing milk at a serious cost and the committee produced a report not long ago which demonstrated that many supermarket multiples use milk as a loss leader at the expense of the primary producer.  That issue must also be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500006#G00700","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416926100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Deputy Deering mentioned the milk we put on corn flakes.  As a child I grew up on a dairy farm and I remember having unpasteurised milk on corn flakes.  I liked the cream that was still part of the milk.  Since that time, I have learned that such usage of milk was grossly reckless and irresponsible of my parents to the point that perhaps they could have been prosecuted for it.  Certainly, some people in the State now would ban such usage.  The witness mentioned that there is a demand for fresh milk in Ireland which there is not on the Continent - in Spain, France, etc. - but there is also a demand, albeit much smaller, for raw, unpasteurised milk.  There is an ongoing debate and I understand the Department is still looking into the issue with a view to banning raw milk.  Does the National Milk Agency have a view on whether it is desirable to ban raw milk?  Such milk must be properly labelled and there is a voluntary assumption of risk by consumers, but should it be banned?<\/p><p>  Much interesting data was presented, particularly concerning trends in the past number of years - up to 20 years, in some instances.  One of those trends has been that the fresh milk market has fewer dairies, with a move towards one dairy being increasingly dominant, even to the point of producing milk for other dairies.

It lived up to the billing in terms of reporting.  The concentration of power in the hands of a number of multiples will leave a very desolate landscape across the country.  As the witnesses noted, corner shops and other very important institutions, particularly in rural areas, are being wiped out, as we are all acutely aware.  That trend seems as if it could accelerate.  It is worrying that the abolition of quotas will represent an opportunity and a threat; will this accelerate the trend and leave us with industrialised milk farmers, as opposed to family farm units that generate income across areas?  The agency has examined the issue fairly and quite rightly presented us with documentation from the past 20 years, so we can see the inevitable trend.  Will that be accelerated in a context in which we have a massive import market?  We cannot stop free trade and we are all subscribed to it.  We certainly avail of it at other levels.<\/p><p>  The level of imports is staggering with this product, although we have some degree of prominence in the area.  If we had not achieved world leadership in the highly tuned processing areas, such as the baby formula market and other associated and ancillary products of that nature, would we not be in a right mess?  Where could we go?  When the quota is abolished, where do the witnesses see us ending up?  Are there opportunities to go into other niche markets across the world?

I would like the witnesses to bear this in mind in answering Deputy Deering.  Sterling is now at a level at which it is 20% more expensive for those producers outside the State to sell to us.  It is very good for us to export to the UK and be paid in sterling, but it is very expensive to buy milk in sterling.  How on earth can the milk farmers in the North be competitive?

In reply to the last question, it is a recent development that milk is being acquired from producers in the South and processed in the North before coming back as an import into the South in packaged form.  It is a recent development and has not been taking place to date.  It will take place going forward.  The impact is that now we have people purchasing milk for liquid production who will not come within the remit of the agency.  They will be importing milk acquired in the South from Northern Ireland after it has been processed.  The only thing we can say is that the compensation to the producer - I do not wish to comment on any one processor - must be matched in some way with the others in the Republic.  People watch how their payments match up against other processors.<\/p><p>  At the core of most of the questions is what is happening post quota.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about this.  There will be volatility, not just in liquid milk prices but in dairy prices.  Charts in the annual report show that, in recent times, the compensation mechanism was 75%, and this was a fixed price that was not linked to composition.  The world began to change in the past three years, and most prices for liquid milk producers are based on the world manufacturing price as reflected in the manufacturing price of other producers plus a premium.  The world price will fluctuate.  At the meeting we attended last week and on the news quite recently, it was suggested the dairy prices worldwide are under some pressure.  They will go up and down from April, because liquid milk producers are linked to those prices.  Our job is to consider the adequacy of compensation given the economic cost of production, and this becomes more central in the environment created by that.  The adequacy of compensation and the premium paid, if maintained, reinforce the long-term commitment of liquid milk producers, but this also takes on the role of something that must be adjusted to reflect changes in the world price for milk if it is to be passed on as a base price as liquid milk producers.  What was legislated for in 1995 has gained a second significance given the removal of quotas and the link to the compositional nature of milk.<\/p><p>  This also relates to the question raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v concerning the table showing prices.  The price we are monitoring has moved from whole milk to skimmed milk and low-fat.  A retail price for milk is very difficult to get as an exact figure.  It is a poignant figure from the point of view of everyone in the industry in respect of the percentage everyone is getting.  Initially, when we started this table in 1996, we thought the best figure was the CSO figure.  That was fine until the CSO decided to stop reporting the price of 1 litre of full-fat milk and moved to low-fat milk.  In an attempt to maintain consistency, we note that it is the price given by the CSO for the past two years for low-fat milk and we make a broad assumption that the price of one litre of low-fat milk is the same as the price of full-fat milk, using that as a basis for comparison.  That is the reason for the adjustment in the statistics, which is not very satisfactory.  We thought about various ways of dealing with it, but there must be some degree of acceptance by all players.  The CSO is the independent organisation that we reached for.<\/p><p>  Another question concerned the compensation payable to producers and the percentage thereof.  In respect of low-fat milk, the cream was being used and sold separately.  That is true, and I remember doing a project with Avonmore in this regard.  Avonmore Super Milk was being launched at the time and there was quite a degree of money to be made from the fact that the milk was purchased at a flat price and the cream was taken from it to make low-fat milk.  It was being resold for dessert on a Sunday but had already been paid for.  That was the argument made.  It is true, but it is now going away because most of the prices are moving towards a compositional-based pricing mechanism.  Farmers are paid according to the constituents.  It applies in most places but not everywhere.<\/p><p>  With regard to the introduction of quota, there will be an increase in manufacturing milk and an opportunity cost to the production of liquid milk.  There is the possibility of producing as much as one can, and it is up to the producers to choose whether to stay in liquid milk.  That is a third factor that goes into the adequacy of compensation idea.<\/p> <p>Adequacy of compensation must now be considered not only in regard to the economic cost of winter milk production, but also in regard to providing some buffering against the volatility of world prices with which we are now linked.  The compositional nature of the industry must be recognised also.<\/p><p> Northern Ireland represents a sizeable proportion of the market.  In the United Kingdom, milk is largely seen as a commodity and there is little branded milk to be seen there.  Here, there is a much greater loyalty to brands.  This is important here and the brand is part of added value from the point of view of consumers here.  People like to know where their milk comes from and who has produced it.  That is reflected in the fact that the Avonmore brand is up there with Coca Cola here in terms of brand recognition.  The public tends to be loyal to brands.<\/p><p> A question has arisen out of all of this as to why we need to have a national milk agency now that all of this milk will be produced.  The answer is that if we want to maintain confidence and the desire to be in the liquid milk business, the concept of adequacy of compensation, which the Oireachtas introduced, has three important aspects that must be borne in mind.  In regard to liquid milk producers, the agency is where these are brought to mind.<\/p><p> The issues of the National Dairy Council, NDC, logo and own-label and branded milk were raised.  It is important to realise that we are in an EU environment in terms of movement of capital and freedom of movement of goods.  In the agricultural sector in general - not just the liquid milk sector - the freedom of movement of goods is significant for Irish farming.  Products must be able to move to their markets throughout Europe.  It is perfectly acceptable therefore that milk moves between Northern and Southern Ireland.  The NDC logo came about in response to consumer need and desire when dealing with a fresh product.  I mentioned loyalty to local brands and the concept of Irish milk, and the NDC responded to that.  The logo is also a response to the background issue of traceability and the desire to know from where one's milk comes, a desire felt throughout the agricultural sector.  Consumers have responded to the logo and it is important to producers and the industry generally.  We are not alone in having a logo.  People would be aware of the little red tractor label also.  Obviously, the State cannot get involved in that because of the freedom of movement of goods.  The NDC, as a private organisation, took on the work of developing the logo and both producers and consumers see it as a benefit.<\/p><p> The issue of transparency of prices was also raised.  If committee members read this document from cover to cover, they will not find any reference to the wholesale price of milk or to what the multiples pay for milk.  This information is missing.  If I or the chief executive was asked directly or personally whether we thought it would be good to have transparency in that regard, I would say \"Yes\", because that would help us understand better what is going on.  There are significant pressures associated with a concentrated retail market.  If one must rely on three outlets for the control of 70% of the retail market and if one has a spread of products, such as cheese or other dairy products, one might negotiate on a single product or across the board.<\/p><p> In this regard, we have been particularly interested in the grocery code which is now being made introduced in general terms in legislation.  I believe a statutory instrument will flesh this out and it is important in regard to how producers and customers are treated.  From the perspective of producers, the stronger this code the better, because their confidence has already been undermined.  As Deputy Deering said, if producers see milk being sold below cost or close to that, this undermines their confidence, particularly in the context of a quota environment, where if milk being sold is a loss leader, this will not engender confidence to remain in the liquid milk business.  There is an opportunity cost to liquid milk production in that one must commit to that because it is a very different and specialised method of production when one chooses not to go for seasonal production.  It is up to the processors and the retail market to respond on this issue.<\/p><p> Mr. Murphy will add some further comments now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416927300,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Chairman mentioned concentration and the five largest processors.  This is a feature of the milk business worldwide, where some processors are processing the equivalent of the total milk supply of the Irish dairy industry.  The Chairman also mentioned that processors of liquid milk in the State also produce manufacturing milk.  This is a benefit to the agency, because winter milk supplies of liquid milk producers, which are not used in the liquid milk trade, are all being absorbed in other contracts.  For example, the Bailey's Irish Cream contract would be a particular type of contract here.  Therefore, in the winter period the non-liquid produce is important and processors are conscious of that, because it means we will not have a situation where there will be a total wipe-out of the liquid milk producers within the State.  As we have seen, there is extraordinary stability within that group of producers and Teagasc has done some excellent work in this sector.  It emphasises that it is not the scale or the system, but the efficiency with which milk is being produced by the farmer that is the real criterion of our cost effectiveness and profitability at farm level.  There is huge work to be done in this area.<\/p><p>  Another question raised concerned the quotas and whether they would involve the wipe-out of family farmers.  Teagasc has done projections based on the 50% increase in milk production in the State and it believes that by 2020, we could end up with approximately 16,500 dairy farmers, with an average herd of approximately 85 cows.  There is stability in that, but there must be efficiency at farm level in order to survive.  In the current year, in the month of September the milk price was back by 8 cent a litre on last year's prices.  This must affect producers.  The collapse in milk prices has been occurring since June, but the average price for the year will only be back about 1 cent a litre or slightly over that on 2013.  It is next year the crunch will be felt, because the price we have mentioned, 38 cent a litre in 2013, will reduce in 2014 to around 37 cent a litre on average and this will reduce further to 29 cent a litre in 2015, if the 8 cent a litre drop in price continues into 2015.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Brien raised questions in regard to why we are getting so much milk from Northern Ireland.  Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has already referred to the fact that Northern Ireland has, basically, had its Harvest 2020, because its milk supply has increased by approximately 700 million litres since 1993 - all due to the transfer of quotas from the United Kingdom - and some 500 million litres of that milk comes into this State.<\/p> <p>A full 70% of it is being processed into manufactured dairy products and 15% of it is going into the liquid milk trade.  Basically, capacity has not been installed in Northern Ireland to process the additional milk resulting from their own increase in supply.  That is another factor.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416927900,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Is it just because of the volume in Northern Ireland that they are able to do it so efficiently, given the 20% Sterling disadvantage inherent in selling to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500010#L00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416927900,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There is a mystery there.  Going back over quite a number of years, the manufacturing price within this State and in Northern Ireland have been roughly the same.  In effect, the producers in Northern Ireland have had an all-year-round milk production system which was under the remit of the old milk marketing boards and so forth.  They have been stuck with that system.  The most efficient system is milk production off grass, as has been emphasised by Teagasc.  It is possible for a liquid milk producer to be an efficient producer off grass.  The important elements are to ensure intense grazing, produce as much fodder off one's own grass base as possible and to minimise the use of concentrates.  The two essential parts of efficient milk production are herd and grassland management.  The farmers who are good at that, who have the right EBI cows in their herds and who reduce the amount of concentrate feed used do well.  In that regard, Ireland is the New Zealand of the EU because our strength lies in our emphasis on pasture-based production.<\/p><p>  The question of raw milk is really a public health issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is examining the issue currently.  We pasteurise milk to reduce any risks to health.  The pasteurisation process has been a basic of the dairy industry for many years.  There would be risks involved in the consumption of raw milk unless the hygiene standards on the farm are absolutely top class, as verified by veterinary experts.

Undoubtedly, there is a commitment by the consumer here to liquid milk and for that reason, there will be a market for liquid milk for the foreseeable future.  The question is whether there will be producers to supply that market in current and future circumstances.  The Oireachtas, in its wisdom, decided that liquid milk producers would be given a special position because of that demand.  It further decided that adequate compensation was a necessity, which has a number of aspects to it because of the new situation that pertains.  If we want to have home-produced liquid milk available to consumers, the element of the legislative provisions regarding producers being paid properly must be pursued by the agency, in conjunction with the notion of registering liquid milk contracts.

In this case, the only people who can produce the product economically for this island are the northern and southern producers.<\/p><p> Over the coming two years do the witnesses envisage the manufacturing price, that is, the manufacturing price plus a premium for winter production, being the determinative price for the southern producer of liquid milk, or is it the competition from liquid milk producers in the North selling at discounts because of all the surplus milk they had from the free quota?  The second question that puzzles all of us is how the Northern Ireland producer can not only compete but be the price setter on the non-branded or own-brand milk when they are producing milk all year round, which as the witness said is a more expensive way of producing milk in total and given that many of the producers are both manufacturing and liquid milk producers and, second, sterling has gone wrong.  Are they still the big price determinant?<\/p><p> Finally, Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh might recall that at an event organised by the IFA earlier this year he mentioned that there is one retailers' representative on the board of the National Milk Agency.  I understand that representative does not come from one of the big five.  Would it be in the interests of producer stability in the market and ensuring that the Deputy and his cohorts can make money from liquid milk production to have a representative on the board from the big five multiples?  Would that add to the ability of the agency to try to ensure a viable price is paid for milk for the long-term production of liquid milk, or would it take from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500010#L02400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416928500,"counter":57,"content":"<p>In connection with the additional retailer, we have written to the Minister in that regard.

However, the hole in the bucket is that the retailer representative currently on the board generally represents the smaller sized retailer, who is quite an important person to take into account given what I said about that sector being hit.  However, if one wishes to have real questions on price and so forth addressed and discussed, where 70% of the milk is being sold through one channel, and if one wishes to have answers to the questions representation-wise, it would be better if there was somebody there.  That depends on whether they wish to participate.  They may think they are so powerful they do not have to explain themselves at all.  There could be an organisation of which they are members which might wish to appoint somebody or otherwise, but that is a matter for the Government to decide.<\/p><p>  The representative on the board at present has been there since the foundation of the agency and has made very valuable contributions.  Bear in mind that there are other players apart from the multiples.  As well as the smaller retailer there is the milk round man, whose business is coming back and improving slightly.  It is a very difficult task given the difference in price for door-to-door sales.  There is also the catering sector.  One could do a masters degree on that sector because there is no brand and no traceability there.  It could be viewed by catering as a product that must be supplied free, so I am sure that has an impact on how caterers look at the supply of milk.<\/p><p>  There is a lot taking place but the short answer to the Deputy's question is that it would make it more representative, provided people were prepared to come along and engage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500011#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1416928500,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy and Dr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for attending and answering the questions.

The Irish consumer has consistently expressed a preference for fresh milk, through their purchasing, and it is the agency's role to ensure there is an adequate supply all year round so we are not obliged to take the route of having non-fresh milk.  That is not wanted.  It would be an irony if milk production increased by 50% and we could not buy fresh milk in this country.  It would make no sense.<\/p><p>  There is a greater challenge when one must factor in the variable of the Northern Ireland supply, which might not be as variable as one might think but which is outside the agency's control.  It must be factored in.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out a long time ago, if the UK ran out of its own supply of fresh milk and decided to take milk for the UK from Northern Ireland, as it could do and pay a premium for it, that would goose up the supply here.

These industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Payments are made from the fund by my Department to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  In the period from 2001 to date a total of &euro;895 million has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  State funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.<\/p><p>  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2015, contain an allocation of &euro;68 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This is an increase of &euro;14 million from the 2014 allocation of &euro;54 million.  Some 80% of this will be distributed to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and 20% will go to Bord na gCon in accordance with section 12 of the Act.  In order to allow my Department to provide the monies allocated in budget 2015 it is necessary to comply with a technical requirement in the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act that requires increasing the cumulative limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;68 million.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted here today before this committee.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in this manner in 2004 and each year from 2009 to 2013, inclusive.<\/p><p>  It is estimated the Irish bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs, almost &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and exports worth some &euro;200 million.  Ireland still holds a pre-eminent position in the thoroughbred racing world.  It is the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and is the fourth largest producer in the world.  Approximately 40% of EU thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.  The fund has helped Ireland to develop into a world-class centre of excellence for horse racing and has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The horse racing industry satisfies all the critical requirements for success in terms of employment and foreign direct investment and it is the type of export-orientated industry we need.  Not alone this but the industry has probably done more than any other to enhance our international reputation in recent times.  <\/p><p>  Bord na gCon estimates that the greyhound racing industry employs over 10,300 people and contributes an estimated &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around the tracks, which have a wide geographic spread.  It reports that since 2002 over 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of many counties.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions of the country and it has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.<\/p><p>  The overall objective of the Government is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to the economic and social fabric of the country.  Time and again Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  The support provided by public funds for investment in these industries, through the horse and greyhound racing fund, has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding.  The draft regulations before the committee today provide for an amount totalling &euro;68 million to be allocated to the horse and greyhound industries in 2015.<\/p><p>  The funding mechanism, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, has been proven to be unsatisfactory as it has required increased Exchequer funding over the years.  This increase has been necessary due to successive cuts in betting duty coupled with an increasing amount of betting activity migrating to tax-free platforms.<\/p><p>  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government is addressing, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators are outside the tax net.  The Minister for Finance has published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, which, when enacted, will ensure that all bookmakers taking bets from Ireland pay a 1% betting duty on those bets in the same way that betting shops currently do.  Betting exchanges will also be subject to tax under the new arrangements but the calculation of that tax will differ from that applying to bookmakers - they will be subject to a 15% duty on their commissions.  These measures will ensure that the duty received from betting will increase significantly.  The latest update from the Department of Finance suggests that the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 is likely to pass all Stages in the early part of 2015.<\/p><p>  There was a significant increase in the horse and greyhound fund in the recent budget because there is now a new revenue stream.<\/p> <p>On budget day the Minister for Finance estimated that the increased revenue from online and remote betting will be approximately 25%, and we have decided to allocate a portion of that money to the horse and greyhound industries through the horse and greyhound fund to make up some of the ground lost not so much in the last three years but in the preceding period from 2008, when the fund was &euro;76 million.  It decreased dramatically in recent years, out of economic necessity.  With the availability of a new revenue stream from next year, it is more than justifiable to allocate some of that increased revenue to the industry which predominately generated it.<\/p><p> Indecon Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake a review of certain aspects of the Irish horse racing industry.  The review consisted of an in-depth analysis of the legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the industry in Ireland.  The ensuing report, which was published in July 2012, contained recommendations for change to assist in the future long-term development of the sector. The Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill giving effect to some of the recommendations in the Indecon report is currently being progressed, having recently completed the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  In this regard I thank the Committee for its very helpful report. <\/p><p> Indecon was also commissioned, on foot of a tendering process, to conduct a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon in order to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise the commercial income of Bord na gCon.  The ensuing report, which was published on 7 July 2014, contained 27 recommendations.  Following from the Indecon report, Bord na gCon submitted a document to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, in early October 2014 outlining its plans and timelines to address the key strategic challenges identified by Indecon.  Bord na gCon is proceeding to implement the recommendations in the Indecon report, with the priority being to reduce debt to a sustainable level and address the pension deficit.  At the earliest opportunity, legislation will be brought before the Cabinet for approval, in accordance with procedure, to address some of the recommendations of the Indecon report.<\/p><p> As I stated at the outset,  State funding provided through the horse and greyhound racing fund is pivotal to the survival and future growth of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  These important industries require funding for their survival and to facilitate growth and development into the future.  The Government has made provision in budget 2015 to allocate significantly increased funding compared to the previous two years, as is appropriate for the reasons I have outlined.  My approach has been to insist on independent reviews of both industries and to act on the reviews by making the appropriate changes.  I have also been able to increase funding for the development of the two industries because the availability of a new revenue stream has made it affordable to do so.  <\/p><p> A copy of the draft regulation has been circulated to the members of the joint committee.  Section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  I ask members for their support in ensuring that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided in budget 2015 and that the important role of these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I am making the same request as I made last year and the previous year, namely, that the committee refer the resolution to both Houses for approval without debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500012#N00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416929700,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

At 3%, it would have covered the total cost of this fund, as well as providing money that the State could use for other purposes and additional funding for the horse and greyhound sectors without recourse to ordinary funding from the Exchequer.  In other words, it would have been funded from betting revenue.<\/p><p>  I would have liked some of that money to have been given to organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous Ireland because gambling has become a major affliction in our society.  The one difference between gambling and other addictions, such as alcohol, is that gambling is a hidden addiction that often remains unseen until it is too late.  We are aware of the devastation it is causing for society.  Lots of taxes are socially regressive but the betting tax could have been a socially progressive tax by being put to good use in dealing with the fallout from gambling and, perhaps, discouraging some people from becoming addicted.<\/p><p>  Horse racing and the horse industry in general make a significant contribution to our economy.  It is important that we support the sector.  It is something we are good at, and we have natural advantages as well as inherited advantages and know how due to the stallion tax relief and other measures over the years.  We have built up a very good reputation worldwide and it is important we maintain that reputation by continuing to invest in the industry.

I hope this matter is dealt with expeditiously and the Minister mentioned that legislation will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.  I suppose it would be fair to say that promises of legislation over the years have far exceeded delivery of legislation in Departments as there are always unforeseen delays.  In what kind of timeframe does the Minister realistically expect to see that legislation?  When we get that timeframe, we can multiply it by two, in my experience, because every time we get a list of legislation on the programme for legislation, only about a third of the A-list gets published in any one session.  Therefore, it is important we would see that.<\/p><p> As I said, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the passage of the regulations under consideration.

Like the previous speakers, I would like to support the legislation for the fund of &euro;68 million.  This summer, we were fortunate enough to have most of the bodies concerned with racing, such as the Turf Club and HRI, in to talk to this committee about the new legislation.  Dermot Weld gave the very good example, which the two previous speakers might consider, of looking on racing as an Enterprise Ireland or an IDA considering the amount of foreign direct investment involved.  It is not just about tech, or manufacturing, or the Googles or the food business; it is an industry all of its own.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Ferris said, it is really the thread of rural Ireland.  A bit like with Katie Taylor, except Katie Taylor does not have as many people employed, we are the best in the world at this.

Why do the Middle East Arabs have such huge investment here and employ so many Irish people?  For future generations, if we can plan towards that increase in the betting tax then, once and for all, as the previous speakers said, we can sit here and know we have an industry that not only generates enough funding to look after itself and grow to even greater strength but also, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, look after the gambling problems.<\/p><p>  To finish with Dermot Weld, he brought in an American owner who had never been to Ireland but who ended up moving his headquarters from London and America and employing 300 people.

I welcome this significant increase in the investment in rural Ireland through the investment in the horse and greyhound fund.  The Minister has outlined the economic activity of &euro;1.1 billion from the horse industry and &euro;500 million from the greyhound industry.  That is economic activity in parts of rural Ireland where there is very little alternative and where there are no big multinationals employing people.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Brien referenced foreign direct investment.  At the Goffs sales, I was struck by the number of high net worth individuals who had flown in from all around the world to buy Irish horses.  It is a product we sell that, if it was in some different sphere, would probably have even more supports from the IDA.  Rather than feeling in any way uneasy about how he would explain this to people in Ireland, Deputy Ferris should recognise it is a very good news story that we can tell.  It is the Government supporting 14,000 jobs, although I know it was 16,000 not long ago and over 20,000 some time before that.  There is no reason we cannot get back to 20,000 jobs but that will need a more sustained period of investment.<\/p><p>  In recent years, due to the economic circumstances, we have had a situation where the money has been a matter of survival for the racing industry.

While not a hypothecated tax, the link with the Betting (Amendment) Bill is very obvious, and that is a link I will not let go of if the Department of Finance ever tries to come back in.  There was never a justification for dropping the betting tax from 2% to 1%, but I accept the Minister, Deputy Noonan's point that he wants the Betting (Amendment) Bill, and the extension to offshore and online betting, bedded in first, and we can then look at the overall rates.

We flushed out a number of conflicts.<\/p><p> Later on this afternoon there is a meeting of the working group of the Chairs of the committees and one of the issues on the agenda is pre-legislative scrutiny.  I think it is to finalise protocols because this committee was one of the pilots.  We will know better when the legislation comes into the House how quickly or otherwise that legislation proceeds through the Houses as a result of having gone through the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I do not know if there is anything the Minister wants to respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500014#P00500","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416930900,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Everyone here has been very supportive of these two industries.  This is a 26% increase in one year.  In the context of the budgetary challenges we have been facing, that is a pretty extraordinary increase in one year, and it is on the back of virtually doubling the revenue stream we will get from betting tax next year.  The Department of Finance is predicting that there will be an extra revenue stream of &euro;25 million.  We are actually only bringing in &euro;25 million from bookmakers at the moment from betting tax.  One must look back as far as 2007 to see a revenue stream of more than &euro;36 million coming from betting tax.<\/p><p>  We are now going back to raising much more money from betting tax because we are bringing into the tax net the way in which many people bet remotely now, on their phones or computers.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was anxious that we would get that system up and running before we had the debate on the appropriate rate.  The focus within the Department of Finance has been getting remote betting working from a tax point of view.  A number of countries which have tried to do this and failed and others which have done it somewhat successfully are watching this carefully but actually getting a revenue stream from online activity is never straightforward, so it was important to work with the industry here and get a system that functions.  The Minister has made it clear that he is open to a debate on the rate.  My views on the appropriate rate for betting tax are well known.  I have often spoken about the need for 2% or 3% or even a higher percentage but the important thing is that we get it working.  As a result of what the Minister has done, we now see an increase of &euro;14 million going into this industry.  Let us welcome progress when it is there.  We have seen a doubling of the revenue stream coming from betting and we can now have that debate on the appropriate rate in future.<\/p><p>  The betting tax provisions have had to go through the European Commission in respect of state aid rules.  This has not been straightforward.  It has gone to the Commission twice, because using a portion of or all betting revenue to support an industry can be and is challenged by other countries under competition rules and state aid rules.  However, the outcome for the industry has been very positive this year and we will hopefully build on it next year.  I take Deputy Ferris's point that there are many pressures on expenditure at the moment, so this sounds like a great deal of money for a sector to people who do not understand the sector and its significance.  That is why we all have a responsibility to explain why this sector is so significant and so important for parts of Ireland that often do not have much else.  I hope people can support what we are doing and we will come back and have a discussion on the rate issue at a later date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014112500015#Q00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930900,"counter":82,"content":"<p>On the point of the pre-legislative scrutiny, one of our recommendations was that there would be a second seat for people from the industries' committee on the board of Horse Racing Ireland, which would include the employees of the stable industry, which is the biggest cohort of people working in the industry by far.

This is our third occasion to present to the committee and we have very strong progress to report.  We also want to outline a new initiative we are bringing into play to facilitate addressing the skills needs in the tech sector.<\/p><p>  The presentation has three elements: a brief overview of FIT, information on a recent skills audit we just concluded in October and some detail on the proposed programme we are launching in January 2015.  The key aspect of the presentation is that we are very conscious of growth in the economy.  In the past year we have seen approximately 3,600 jobs announced in the tech sector, which gives a total of some 22,000 jobs since 2010.  In terms of FIT's activity in recent months, we have seen a serious growth in activity in terms of companies taking on new staff and acquiring skills.  Therefore, there is a real opportunity and, I hope, a lot of good news to be presented to the committee today.<\/p><p>  Clearly, FIT is about the economy and about supporting competitiveness and growth.  We want to acknowledge that a lot of work in regard to the opportunity for further education and training to contribute to the tech sector has been already achieved.  In particular, the heavy lifting with regard to the establishment of SOLAS and the ETBs is now in place and there is a strong foundation on which to build and enable more people to acquire jobs in the tech sector at levels 5 and 6.<\/p><p>  As previously outlined, FIT is an industry-led initiative and most of the major multinational technology companies in Ireland, plus many significant indigenous companies, are on its board.  FIT is a registered charity and a not-for-profit organisation.  Our endgame is to maximise the number of young and not-so-young people in Ireland to acquire the skills to compete in the tech sector.  FIT commenced in Dublin in 1999 and is now an all-Ireland initiative which operates in Northern Ireland also.<\/p><p>  In essence, our mission is to promote what we call an inclusive smart economy.  There tends to be a focus in the debates and discussions around the tech sector on the need for STEM and honours maths.  There is a certain need for those types of disciplines but, as we will outline later, there is a greater need for a broad range of skillsets within the IT sector in Ireland, much of which can be facilitated through programmes at levels 5 and 6.  We have three key pillars in terms of our activity.  We engage a lot of our activity and resources around the long-term unemployed and second-chance opportunities.  More recently, because of the downturn and with the imminent growth, we have focused a lot of energy on the reskilling and upskilling of unemployed professionals.  An area of particular attention for FIT at this time is the young unemployed, which is the primary focus of our presentation.<\/p><p>  How we develop our initiatives is very much down to creating cross-collaboration, discussion and debate between industry, education and training and providers and the community sector in regard to the actual needs of industry.  Thereafter, we engage widely with unemployed individuals to mobilise and encourage them to consider careers and skills within the IT sector.  To date, with the support of the ETBs, SOLAS and industry, more than 16,500 people have participated in FIT programmes, of whom more than 12,000 are in jobs today.<\/p><p>  One of the clear messages we need to get out to the wider public, including the parents and young people of Ireland, is that the IT sector requires a broad range of skills and is not all programming or algorithms.  It requires a variety of skillsets from people who are person-orientated, who are good with their hands, who are creative or who are artistic, as well as those whose focus is the hard coding and programming.  There is a variety of different career routes within the tech sector that can be considered by individuals, career guidance teachers and parents.<\/p> <p>What we are saying, and as we see on a daily basis, is that ICT skills permeate job opportunities.  To compete even at a general level within the general economy requires an appreciation, knowledge and understanding of ICT.  For example, 90% of vacancies are advertised online, and applications are made online.  It is very much a knowledge-based society.<\/p><p> A key backdrop to our presentation is that we have just concluded our second ICT skills audit for 2014 the focus of which was to identify the needs and demands of the technology sector, to facilitate policy makers and education and training providers with programmes that are responsive to emerging and future needs, and to give direction to young people and jobseekers in terms of imminent opportunities.  In essence it is to create a more complete, comprehensive talent pipeline.  On this occasion more than 60 companies participated in the skills audit, representing in excess of 30,000 employees.<\/p><p> The information from the skills audit is robust and accurate.  The good news is that we have identified in excess of 7,000 vacancies within the technology sector in Ireland.  Those vacancies are available today, and it is interesting that 75% of them can be filled through programmes at levels 5 and 6.  They fall within the range of what we call competent and entry level, whereas 25% of them are at the higher expert level.  Within that framework we are promoting a broader community of smart people with smart skills.<\/p><p> In our discussions we see an upturn in the economy.  There is definite growth within the technology sector in Ireland.  Every day we hear of new job announcements but we need to make hay while the sun shines.  We must first address the vacancies that are available with appropriate programmes and then build additional programmes responsive to future needs and demands within the sector.<\/p><p> We are getting clear messages from both multinational and indigenous companies that there is strong confidence in the skills base within Ireland but there is a desire to see more people come through that framework in terms of job opportunities.<\/p><p> Regarding the skills audit, we took a unique approach in terms of the analysis in that we broke down the technology sector into 12 different disciplines.  In each of those disciplines we broke down the sub-skillsets that are required within the technology sector because IT is a very broad area, and it can be confusing for individuals.  Certain skillsets can be required in three or four different disciplines so we took a grander approach.  We broke it down into sub-skillsets and then broke it down further because we wanted companies to clearly identify where they recruit people at an entry level position and where they require what we call competent and expert level positions.  Through that we have been able to develop a range of new courses and programmes that are much more responsive to the emerging and future needs of the technology sector.  From our perspective this model has worked well in terms of responding to the future needs and demands of the technology sector but we believe a similar model could be engaged across other sectors of the economy such as pharmaceutical and medical, hospitality, catering etc.  There might be a template the committee might consider would be appropriate in terms of enabling growth in other sectors of the economy.<\/p><p> The skills audit identified a substantial number of employment opportunities.  A fundamental issue that was recognised is that we need to have a far broader perspective and understanding of tertiary education.  Currently in Ireland we seem to work in two silos, first, the silo on planning around further education and training and, second, the silo on planning around higher education and training, but there does not seem to be a continuum.  To a degree we have created a polarity.<\/p> <p>In some ways there is a general perspective that the most valuable route to skills is predominantly higher education or third level education.  Sometimes that is at the expense of appreciation of the potential contribution of further education in terms of meeting the skills demands of our economy and its ability to facilitate a broader range of people considering skills sets.<\/p><p> If one looks at the totality of our tertiary education system, currently we invest in excess of &euro;1.5 billion in third level provision or higher education.  We also invest more than &euro;800 million in further education and training.  For that reason alone, there must be better joined-up thinking between what is really achievable and deliverable under FE and what is necessarily achievable and deliverable under higher education.<\/p><p> What has enabled a review and reassessment of the quality of FE has been the development of the new common awards system with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  For example, we had a direct role in developing the new ICT awards at levels 5 and 6 and we have great confidence in their robustness and responsiveness to the current and emerging needs of industry.  The programmes we can build in the future are of a much higher quality and calibre than what may have existed, due to past certification becoming outdated over time.  They are now fit for purpose and the value and quality of FE and its potential to contribute to the tech sector and beyond is much stronger than in the past.<\/p><p> In that context, the key lessons of what we are saying is that we must find a more effective dialogue between higher and further education.  We must encourage and persuade young people that levels 5 and 6 are also a pathway to careers in IT.  We must also reflect on the dialogue or primary promotion that the only way to a career in IT is through STEM and honours mathematics.  While there will be always a need and demand for more graduates, there also will be a greater demand for broader skills sets.  The danger with just that dialogue is that we might encourage more people to deselect themselves from considering careers in IT because they do not necessarily have STEM or honour mathematics, rather than thinking they are potential candidates.<\/p><p> I attended an event we held this morning with the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, ETB, in one of the Hilton hotels.  There were 300 young people looking at the possibility of working with Microsoft and exploring different career opportunities in the tech sector.  The level of confidence and aspiration within that room was amazing.  We must encourage and nurture that with the development of new programmes.<\/p><p> With regard to the key recommendations that emerge from the skills audit, the good news is that there are more than 7,000 vacancies.  There is a requirement to develop new and appropriate courses at levels 5 and 6, a necessity to create a greater dialogue between further and higher education, we must break down the sides of the two and we must present tertiary education as a continuum of education, not one path or another path.  Both are equally valued by the sector and create real opportunity.<\/p><p> One of the concluding recommendations in the skills audit has its findings in the previous skills audit of 2012, which at that time identified 4,000 to 4,500 vacancies within the tech sector.  The number of vacancies has increased.  One of the key recommendations in the previous draft of the audit identified the need to introduce a dual education initiative within ICT at level 5 and level 6.  I am pleased to announce that the recommendation was fully endorsed in the latest draft of the skills audit 2014 and we are now in a position, with the support of the Government, to begin a pilot of the ICT associate professional, which is a dual education or an apprenticeship style approach to skills training for the tech sector.  I would love to be able to say it is very new and innovative but, to some degree, we are playing catch up.  The UK, Germany, Denmark and Australia have been applying apprenticeship type models to skills development in the non-traditional trades for many years.  <\/p><p> However, we are very enthusiastic about the model presented in the presentation.  We have strong industry buy-in to it.  There was a long gestation period in developing this initiative and there was a great deal of dialogue with education and training providers, industry and potential learners.<\/p> <p>The initiative will involve a two year programme during which participants will achieve a level 5 or level 6 information and communications technology technical award, either in systems and networks or software development.  They will also achieve level 5 or level 6 professional development project management certification.  The first six months will be college-based.  During the second year three days will be spent in the workplace and two days in college, while in the last six months four days will be spent in the workplace and one day in college.<\/p><p> I am a product of the old apprenticeship model, as I am a bricklayer by trade.  I have seen first-hand the potential of dual education or applied learning in enabling people to combine technical know-how with application in the workplace.  Regardless of the programme involved, one of the concerns of companies in engaging graduates is that they can and often do have the technical or academic understanding but not necessarily the application or they do not appreciate how to apply that knowledge and understanding in the workplace.  These programmes are not only required at levels 5 and 6.  We maintain that they are required within higher education also.<\/p><p> The intention is that during the first six months the candidates will remain on whatever allowances to which they are entitled, whether a training allowance or a social welfare payment.  From the second six months onwards, in the remaining 18 months, they would be paid by the companies in question.  The idea is that they would be sponsored by companies from the outset.  We have a strong buy-in and commitment from companies.  Already leading companies such as Accenture, CIX, Fujitsu, IBM, Microsoft, SAP and Version 1 have signed up to it.  We have discussed the possibilities with a variety of other companies and their level of interest is substantial.<\/p><p> This is going live.  Our first recruitment fair for candidates will commence on 9 December in the RDS.  The first two courses will commence in Dublin, followed by courses in the midlands and Cork regions.  Our intention is that by the middle to the end of next year programmes will be available throughout the country.  One key aspect is that this is not an urban initiative.  We can be found in a variety of locations throughout the country and are keen to engage as many young people as possible.  Our initial pilot scheme covers 200 places, but our aspiration is that within three to five years we will have 3,000 odd people involved in such programmes.<\/p><p> While this is a level 6 programme, the expectation is that it will also be a progression pathway to further and higher education.  The idea is that candidates will not remain at level 6 at the end of the programme.  The intention is that, in collaboration with their companies and in line with personal career aspirations, they will progress and continue to further and higher education.<\/p><p> That is the overview.  We have a clear understanding of the technology sector, its needs and the opportunities it offers.  It is a growth sector.  We need to fuel that growth and in fuelling it we can stimulate other companies to consider Ireland as a location.  Within that context we believe this initiative incorporating ICT and professionals is of its time and needs broad support.  I will be glad to take questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014112500004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416923700,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Davitt and the group represented before the committee.

The deputation will remember the dot coms in the early 2000s and the number of people who got involved in that area.  We then had a boom in the construction, engineering and architecture sectors.  It is certainly a good initiative that the programme will allow companies with real job opportunities to become involved and, in turn, provide training.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on what the deputation states is the experience of the third level sector and the flaws within it.

First, I will deal with the Deputy's views on the third level sector.  We are talking about creating a mix in the third level sector.  We have strong programmes at third level and are producing levels 7, 8 and 9 graduates.  However, competing jurisdictions is what we are putting the real emphasis on here today.  As the tech sector is booming globally the talent need is the same in all of the other jurisdictions and we are trying to target a mix.  The third level sector is strong but we do not have an appropriate apprenticeship model for the digital sector and digital age.  That is what we are talking about here.  We also have conversion programmes and bring people in from other non-tech sectors into the tech sector.  This is not so much about what we have but about what we are missing which is what the associate professional scheme is about.<\/p><p>  Second, I share the Deputy's concern about vacancies and the skills demand piece.  Let me give a couple of figures that show we are progressing strongly.  When I started this job about five or six years ago, 74,000 people were employed in the tech sector broadly but we now have 105,000 people employed which means there has been a strong increase in employment in the sector of 40%.<\/p><p>  Third, the vacancy rate is a good news story as it means there has been very healthy growth in the sector.  Going back to my previous point, there is global competition for talent and Ireland has created a competitive advantage.  In every jurisdiction every company is trying to find the right skills for their companies.  Ireland is doing a lot to put its best foot forward and has done so better than some other countries.  Ireland has an ICT skills action plan and the proposed associate professional programme.  Ireland is now the victim of its own success because some companies that came here with five or six employees but met their target to find 100 skilled employees ahead of time changed strategy and now wants to hire up to 250 people.  Ireland has improved.

A grander analysis similar to the framework we put together for the skills audit could be used for other sectors of the economy, such as pharma, medical devices, hospitality and culinary skills.

I acknowledge the huge investment made by companies in terms of the skills audit.  I spend a significant amount of time going in and out of companies.  Companies are busy doing their day jobs and growing their business.  The one occasion on which I found it difficult to engage with companies was when we discussed the needs of industry and how they could be better facilitated through provision.  There is a need for more proactive or dynamic initiatives for dialogue and responding to the needs of industry across different sectors.  We also need more effective dialogue between the continuum of what is provided in further education and higher education.

I was interested to learn that Mr. Davitt was formerly a bricklayer and was then able to change direction.  I recently presented awards for the applied leaving certificate to individuals aged 16, 17 and 18 years.  These people are learning skills at the same time as they are getting an education.  The ability to see people lift themselves up and achieve in certain areas is heartening.  One individual, Paul Mooney, left school at the age of 14 years and worked for me as a butcher in one of our supermarkets before leaving to develop himself and become president of the National College of Ireland.  That is an example of the ability of somebody to switch from one area to another, particularly in respect of switching from something involving skills of the hands to being able to use the skills of the mind as well.<\/p><p>  Is Springboard doing the right job or could it be doing more?  Springboard is aimed at people who have experience and ability at level 5 or above but who discover that there were no job vacancies for their skills, particularly when the construction industry was not hiring.

They may well be needed back in construction now.<\/p><p>  Can we learn something from the experience of other countries?  Reference was made to apprenticeships in Germany.

Springboard has its place and is a valuable contributor in terms of addressing skills, as are initiatives such as Momentum, skills training and FETAC levels 5 and 6.  We need to have a co-ordinated approach and very clear expectations for each industry sector in terms of what can be achieved and delivered over a period of time.  We are very clear about the employment potential within the tech sector and want to maximise the realisation of employment in that sector.  From a FIT perspective, when we get up in the morning we are thinking about the 7,000 vacancies, and how we will develop more programmes and encourage more people to acquire skills.  We can add value with a more co-ordinated approach.<\/p><p>  In Ireland there is a focus on dual education and apprenticeship models for traditional trades, and that has been very successful.  Let us take that learning and apply it to other sectors of the economy.  Any work-orientated programme, provided by whatever entity, be it a third level institution, a further education body or the private sector, should be employment proofed.

There is a clear picture of what needs to be done.  In many respects, the programmes are in place and it might be a matter of bringing them together.  There is concern about the 7,000 vacancies, but I wish to reinforce the good work which has been done.  We were ranked third in the world by the IMD competitiveness yearbook for the availability of skills in 2013.  We have now moved up to first, which is a good improvement.  Just because we are first does not mean we can rest on our laurels.  We still need to keep on pushing.<\/p><p>  There are four or five pillars in terms of tackling the growing skills demand.  It is a healthy demand because of the great things many companies who want to invest in Ireland see.  Companies want to invest and bring their companies here, and there are also growing indigenous sectors.  We have conversion programmes, and that is part of what Skillnets is.  Skillnets, another Government programme, supports the conversion of graduates from different fields.  We have the traditional third level degree programmes offered by institutes of technology and universities.  We now have the associate professional programme.<\/p><p>  On the other side, the IDA does great work in attracting companies to Ireland, but we also need to work on attracting people to Ireland.  People look at Ireland as a very strong place to invest for their tech companies.  Why not look at it as a very strong place for people to invest in their tech careers?<\/p> <p>In other words, no longer would it be a big thing for a person just to list a particular company on his or her CV.  It would also be a real feather in a person's cap, in terms of his or her tech career, to have worked in Ireland.  Those four aspects are very important.  We have measures in place in terms of all of them and therefore it is just a matter of bringing it all together.  <\/p><p> Touching on what Mr. Davitt said about career guidance, underlying all this is the need to ensure that students and teenagers considering careers - and parents and those who are guiding them - know of the great opportunities available.  We have a programme called Smart Futures that is run through Science Foundation Ireland.  It promotes tech careers.  We need to continue to push this.  We are starting to have all of the key elements and there is a reason we are now first in the world for availability of skilled labour.  We can do even better.  All of those pieces add together.  There are two things we need to recognise.  Tech companies do not just need tech skills.  They need people with critical communication skills and business acumen.  Those things are very important for many of the tech companies in Ireland.  Non-tech companies need tech skills as well.  It is very important to recognise all of the opportunities that are available to this broad eco-system of tech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014112500011#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Sweetman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416925200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I was at the launch of the skills audit in IBM.  Many CEOs of the Education and Training Boards, ETBs, were there.  What has been the momentum since then? Have the ETBs begun to not only listen but to act on some of the points made in the skills audit?  Have they started chopping and changing what they do in order to provide courses that address the issues raised in the ICT skills audit?<\/p><p>  I welcome what Mr. Davitt had to say on requiring courses to be employment-proofed.  In the very early days, when we came into Government, there was a carryover.  Some courses were being offered simply because they were the courses that were always offered.  No one was questioning their outcomes or the employability of someone who had completed a particular course.  Much has changed since then.  However, the committee should seek to ensure the relevant Departments would require employment-proofing of courses and other projections for the future. <\/p><p>  People look at the issue of career guidance from many different aspects.  From the secondary school point of view, a career guidance-counselling model operates at the moment.  Recently, many highly qualified people, who do the best they can, have entered the career guidance-counselling profession.  We had a problem a few years ago in the banking sector.  The people responsible for signing off on loan approval did not understand the tech sector.  Often, people with ideas - potential SMEs -  were not able to get loans because of a misunderstanding of the tech sector and the type of business a person was trying to put forward.  Looking at the bigger picture, is that the case in career guidance at the moment?  Is there an absence, across the board, of a real understanding of the variety of avenues and types of jobs and professions available?  Are we ensuring young people get the best outcomes when they receive career guidance - not the counselling part - in school?  My understanding is that this may not be the case.  That is through no fault of theirs.  Do we need to investigate that a bit more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014112500012#O00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416925200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Career guidance is fundamental.  It sets an individual on a particular path.  Everything can be enhanced and improved.  In terms of career guidance, no one is an expert in everything and no one can be.  We therefore have to find mechanisms by which career guidance teachers, schools and other resources can leverage the advice and insight of others.  We need to find mechanisms to ensure more effective dialogue between the industry - and different sectors - and schools and colleges. There may also be a role for chambers of commerce and so forth so that they can have a more direct input.<\/p> <p>For every course we support across the country, at whatever level, we organise a company visit.  Everybody goes on a company visit as part of their training, ideally to a company in an area relevant to what the person is studying.  This gives an insight into the job opportunities that are out there and offers students an opportunity to talk to employees in the sector.  People doing certification examinations may hit a brick wall and wonder what is the point of going on.  This type of industry engagement can help them to see it is worth persisting and there is a job at the end of it.<\/p><p> I do not like the term \"mock interviews\"; we prefer to call them \"simulated interviews\".  We put great emphasis on this particular strategy, which involves asking people to research actual job vacancies before having them \"interviewed\" for those roles by an industry representative, FIT staff member or a tutor from the relevant education and training board or college.  It is about bringing real life into training and there is scope for us to do more in this regard.  We are looking to do more, for example, in terms of supporting career guidance within schools and finding creative ways of ensuring an effective dialogue between industry and colleges.<\/p><p> At this point we have worked with most education and training boards throughout the country.  They have come through a massive change process, as part of the fundamental reform of the entire further education sector.  It is the most significant reform we have seen in a long time.  My instinct in talking to CEOs, principals and tutors is that there is a real desire and enthusiasm to build for the future and create the right programmes.  There is a recognition, too, that programmes must develop and evolve.  Instead of having two pillars working in the same space, we now have a single, more focused approach.  My sense in working with ETBs and colleges is that there is a strong desire to get the right types of courses in place and a strong commitment to enabling people to acquire the skills they need to compete for jobs.  I am very optimistic that the ETBs, with the support of SOLAS, will be very responsive to opportunities in the technology sector and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014112500012#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416925500,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Davitt.

I am not sure how familiar the committee members are with the story of IBM in Ireland.  We invested in a campus facility in Mulhuddart in the mid-1990s, employing thousands of people in three large manufacturing operations.  For a variety of reasons, each of these manufacturing operations left Ireland over the years.  However, today IBM employs more people in Ireland and at higher skill levels than ever before - this was achieved by upskilling the workforce and attracting people with the right skills.  There is no one answer to how IBM became a success in Ireland - it was a mixture of hiring local talent, growing our own talent through a variety of programmes, attracting people with the right skills from outside Ireland and so on.  The work presented by FIT today sends the message that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to these things.  There is much talk of the need for top graduates and people with PhDs in the skills debate - we have also been guilty of emphasising this, partially because we have a research activity and a strong demand for the highest level skills.<\/p> <p>That is too simple a story.<\/p><p> The good news is that it does not represent the full level of demand.  As Mr. Davitt set out, there is demand at levels 5 and 6.  As we know, it does not suit everybody to go through the traditional route of doing the leaving certificate, spending a few years in college and then looking for a job.  The ICT associate professional programme outlined today is a very strong addition to the mix of pathways that exist for people, as are Springboard, MOMENTUM and some of the other programmes mentioned.  From the perspective of a company which needs to attract the greatest level of skills we can, the greater the variety of paths open to people the better.  Part of the challenge for the industry, FIT and the committee is to communicate this message more broadly.<\/p><p> The programme which FIT will shortly launch will be a great addition to the Irish ecosystem and I commend Mr. Davitt and Mr. Ryan on their work on bringing the issue to the fore.  Their report is unique in the way it has gone from the ground up and shown the vacancies that exist.  While a figure such as 7,000 raises some eyebrows, it does not suggest the same 7,000 jobs have been going unfilled for months and we have a huge problem.  Rather, it is a snapshot of the level of demand.  While I would not want to say everything is fine and we should not worry, I would see the positive side as Mr. Sweetman outlined earlier.  The vacancies are rolling and the overall employment level is growing.  From IBM's perspective, while we always want more skills, the lack of them has not stopped us from doing anything or been a blocker for us, and that is good.  I hope the programme will be a great success and we are very happy to support it at the pilot stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014112500014#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416926100,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We would value and appreciate the committee's endorsement of the ICT skills audit report and its support for the introduction of the ICT associate professional programme.

I also acknowledge that we had a wonderful trip to Wales which was both constructive and productive.  We learned that there were many similarities between Ireland and Wales.  In some ways, I wondered why we had not been more conscious of this heretofore.  The country has so many things like our own, the language Act, for instance, and one mirrors the other.  I am not sure in which direction, but they are very much alike.  Wales has a language commissioner and also its own Welsh language television channel.  It is to be hoped that from this debate we will find ways and means to progress co-operation between the two countries.<br\/>I also welcome Mr. Julian de Sp&aacute;inn and Mr. Cuan &Oacute; Seiread&aacute;in from Conradh na Gaeilge.  It is always nice to have them here.  They are probably very much up to date on the position in Wales.  Perhaps, however, we might find other ways of working together.  There has to be an echo in terms of the absence of a language Act in Northern Ireland, but the similarities should help us.  <br\/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act, 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Bore da.<\/i><br\/>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to address it and reiterate the kind words about the visit to Wales which we enjoyed.  I think I followed in the committee's wake as I heard about all of the meetings it had with various individuals, including the First Minister.  <br\/>I am the Welsh language commissioner.  In many ways, I am an infant compared to the Irish Language Commissioner who has been in place for ten years.  The role of Welsh language commissioner was established not quite three years ago, as a consequence of a piece of language legislation, the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, one of the first pieces of legislation produced following the devolution of powers to Wales.  It is a very new role but one which builds on the strong tradition of language planning in Wales and the work of the Welsh Language Board which was established under the 1993 Westminster legislation.<br\/>I would like to share some messages which have become very clear to me.  The committee is at a very interesting time in terms of Irish language legislation which it is considering amending.  I see this as a wonderful opportunity for it to set a pattern for the future.  I will raise some issues and questions.  I have examined the proposed heads in the documentation and draw the attention of the committee to some lessons I have learned, of which the first and probably most important which has become apparent to me as Welsh language commissioner is that it is dangerous to leave the language in a policy silo.  If one sees the language as something which is absolutely discrete and it is dealt with solely as such, there is danger.  That approach gives status to the language, but it also means that as one plans for economic, social, employment, education and health policy, it sits outside the debate.  In Wales it has been and continues to be critical for us that we integrate consideration of one of the official languages we use into all policy debates.  That is a key issue for me as commissioner.  As we look at planning and health legislation, it is key that I ask how the language has been considered in the policy proposal, decision or legislation.  That is a key message to share with the committee as it considers new or amending legislation in terms of how it can use the opportunity to integrate the Irish language into the mainstream of policy and politics.  That is something that I have learned is critical.  If one allows the language to sit in a box with &quot;Irish Language&quot; written on the front which is opened occasionally and then shut again, that will not mean productive policy decisions will be made.<br\/>The second issue is current in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Welsh language is seen as a work based skill.  How do we ensure that the Welsh language is seen by employers in the public, voluntary and business sectors as a strength of the workforce?  We have invested in Welsh medium education in Wales, just as Ireland is investing in Irish medium education.  How do we ensure a strong flow of young people from the school setting to the workplace?  I would argue this is critical across Wales.  It is no longer an issue solely for the traditional Welsh speaking communities; it presents significant challenges and opportunities in the context of our large centres of population.  I work in Cardiff on a daily basis.  It is critical that we have bilingual and Welsh language skills in workplaces in Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham.  There is a national challenge for us in Wales to ensure that employers recognise the language as a workplace skill and that they do so in a meaningful way, in terms of planning their workforce for the future and recognising their future needs.<\/p><p> As with all good Welsh sermons, there are three headings to my comments.  I will address the third heading very briefly.  In Wales we have a tradition of language schemes.  I am aware that Ireland has language schemes as a consequence of the legislation introduced here.  Since the Welsh Language Act 1993, Wales has in the region of 600, most of which are statutory, although some voluntary.  While recognising the importance of language schemes in locating language as part of the fabric of Wales, the revised legislation reflects the fact that each language scheme is different.  For the citizen wishing to access Welsh language services, the experience can be very different from organisation to organisation.  As a consequence of recognising that we need to place the citizen or service user at the core of the relationship, we are moving away from language schemes and towards statutory standards for public sector organisations, many third sector and voluntary organisations and, over time, some business organisations.  Rather than having that wonderful tapestry of language schemes, all of which are different, we are moving towards the consistency of statutory standards which will be imposed on organisations over time.  The first set of standards will issue in early 2015 and I am certain these standards will be of interest to the committee.  The first standards will be imposed on the Welsh Government, the 22 local authorities and the three national parks.  By April or May 2015 we will start on a journey whereby Welsh language schemes are set aside for statutory standardised requirements governing service delivery, policy making, internal operations, promotion of the language and evidence keeping.<\/p><p> It is an interesting time for this committee to examine Irish legislation and consider the future of language schemes.  I understand it is considering extending language schemes from three years to seven years.  I may have a view on that.  The question arises from our experience in Wales of how one secures consistency in a language scheme structure.<\/p> <p>Language schemes have changed the face of service delivery in Wales.  Done well, they change the face of service delivery.  We are moving along in that journey which may be of interest to the committee.<\/p><p> As a language commissioner, I have gained great benefit from talking to other countries.  When committee members were in Wales, we discussed the fact that there was an International Association of Language Commissioners, of which the Irish commissioner and I are members.  There are only ten members.  I glean great benefit from examining what happens in other jurisdictions, particularly Canada, where they have attempted to place the citizen at the heart of the relationship with the language.  A citizen does not have to ask for a service in his or her language but is offered it.<\/p><p> Diolch yn fawr.  I thank members for listening and hope I have given them a flavour of some of the issues on which we touch in Wales.  I could talk for hours about the Welsh experience, but I do not think members want that on a very busy day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Meri Huws","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416918300,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir.

Is there simultaneous translation?  As I have a few words of English, we will be okay.  <\/p><p>  I thank the commissioner for her informative speech.  We in Ireland have learned much from Wales during the years and must learn more in the future.  Ms Huws has compared herself to an infant, given that the Office of the Irish Language Commissioner was established before the Welsh one.  Having recently had a baby, I am hearing terminology about growth spurts.  I think the Welsh language commissioner may have spurted into the teenage years and left us behind as toddlers.  Wales has examined exactly what the language commissioner should do and what powers she should have.  The first thing Ms Huws mentioned was integrating the language into the mainstream, which does not seem to be part of the Irish Language Commissioner's role.  For example, in Wales any new Bill or policy must be brought before the Welsh language commissioner who can make recommendations which the relevant Minister or authority must take into account while developing the Bill or policy.  This does not happen in Ireland and is not mentioned in the heads of Bills.  This issue must be addressed clearly and quickly.<\/p><p>  Ms Huws also mentioned workplace skills.  In Wales much of the talk is about how to bring the language into the private sector, not only the public sector.  In Ireland we are very much at the point of the public sector.  Although there was recently a Government initiative to ensure 6% of new entrants into the Civil Service would have a command of the Irish language, we know from the figures provided by the Irish Language Commissioner that the target is far too low to make an impact.  The people taking early retirement happen to be those who were employed when civil servants had to have Irish and a significant command of Irish.  There is a major deficit and a 6% intake in the future will not ensure an adequate number of staff to provide services in Irish.  We are starting from a very low base and will not go anywhere quickly, judging by the Government's proposals.<\/p> <p> One of the other measures we are proposing for inclusion in the language Bill is a quota of at least 30% for the next ten years to address the deficit in the Civil Service before we even begin to look at the private sector.  As this is not contained in the Bill, perhaps it is something at which we might look.  <\/p><p> The third issue mentioned concerned the move from having schemes to statutory standards.  This is something we are trying to promote in the discussion on the language Bill to be placed in front of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As it stands, all we can see is a weakening in what is included in the heads of the Bill which will increase the timeframe for a language plan from three to seven years.  The only reason we can see for doing this is to give Departments more time to avoid what they must do.  The vast majority of plans we have seen so far are very weak.  Even the plans written and agreed to in the past three years contain a significant amount of get out of jail clauses such as \"if resources are available\" or mention \"when Departments are able to achieve this...\".  The terminology has changed, even from what it was when they were put in place originally to something that is far weaker and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is accepting them.  <\/p><p> The heads of the Bill that we are seeing are very weak.  There are only about two things in them that I would describe as good.  The first is the provision that any Irish citizen should be able to use his or her name and address in Irish.  This is something that is not included in legislation, even though everybody thought it was.  Therefore, it is to be welcomed.  The second is that any Department, semi-State company or other body should automatically come under the language Act and not have to be prescribed by the Minister.  This is also to be welcomed.  However, there are only two things in the heads of the Bill which have any merit and they could be introduced as amendments to any other Bill without too much trouble.  <\/p><p> The Government needs to overhaul the Bill it is proposing.  Last week I attended a meeting of coiste comhairleach na Gaeilge with representatives of the Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge, Foras na Gaeilge and a number of community groups.  We were told that the Government was going ahead with the Bill, as it stood and that the Government was not retreating from the heads of Bill on the table.  I will have a meeting with the Minister of State to discuss how much progress needs to be made on the Bill, but it is very weak and lacking and if it is placed in front of the Houses of the Oireachtas as it stands, we will be very worried.  When the Gaeltacht Act passed through the Oireachtas, not one amendment tabled by the Opposition was accepted.  If the Bill goes through as it stands, it will effectively weaken what is provided for Irish speakers.  Not only that, it will be a wasted opportunity because if this is how we are progressing a ten year review of Irish language legislation, we should look to the experience of Ms Huws and the progress made in Wales and include such measures in the language Bill that will be placed in front of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Julian de Sp&aacute;inn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416918600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We are particularly fortunate to have the commissioner with us and the opportunity to ask further questions and tease out some of the points made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500007#G00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1416918600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending.

My apologies - I am noting the point made that we do not have translation facilities.<\/p> <p>While I do not point the finger at anyone in particular here, it shows that the policy of the Houses does not support me in my rights as a parliamentarian who wants to use the language, or the delegates, which is a disappointment.<\/p><p> On the Act, some very interesting points have been made.  I also sit on the Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee which deals with the various ombudsmen.  We had a very interesting meeting the other day with the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Bill Prasifka, who noted that compared to the Official Languages Act, he had a very strong Act, including very serious sanctions he could impose on financial services institutions which did not follow the legislation.  He said that while he had had the powers for a number of years, last year he was also given the power to name and shame.  He said that since he had used the name and shame power, he had achieved a much higher compliance rate among the organisations under the auspices of the Act.<\/p><p> We deal also on the committee with the language commissioner, An Comisin&eacute;ir Teanga, and my sense is that the previous commissioner, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, and the current office holder, Ron&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill, and their teams have done a very good job.  They have done exactly what they have been asked to do, taken all of the complaints on board and followed the procedures, but they have not received co-operation from semi-State bodies and Departments.  For a long time the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht did not live up to its own commitments as regards the Act.  There is a huge backlog in the schemes, in particular, not being ratified by the Department.  We have legislation which is not enforced.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na element is being enforced from a policing point of view, but the judicial element whereby semi-State bodies and Departments are taken to task and made to observe their legal obligations is severely lacking.  I would welcome the delegates' opinions on the heads of the Bill, as I agree with Conradh na Gaeilge that it is a huge step backwards to move towards what is suggested.<\/p><p> What the delegates said about their capacity to review legislation, as it was being passed and, so to speak, Welsh-proof, was interesting.  They might tell us a little more about how that process works.  We do not tend to have that capacity here.  A colleague of mine put forward an equality proofing Bill which was not accepted but which would have required the equality proofing of legislation on all grounds, including equality in language.  Is the Welsh scenario in the context of similar legislation or is there a specific provision in the Act that constitutes the language commission?  Is there specific equality legislation?  There are two ways of doing it.<\/p><p> It is interesting also in that most of the activity we have seen on the part of our own language commissioner is in the area of semi-State bodies and Departments, etc.  The Act does not govern the private sector, whereas there is a very different scenario in Wales where the commission has a wide remit.  Before we came into the formal meeting, the delegates told us about the good work being done with supermarkets.  People walking into shops and businesses in Cardiff get a sense of bilingualism in these outlets, but there is no sense of this being extended here in the heads of Bill we have seen.  Is that somewhere we should be going?  Groups such as Gallimh le Gaeilge in Galway have done great work, as have Cl&aacute;r as Gaeilge and other organisations around the country.  There is a much more vibrant sense of bilingualism in shops and caf&eacute;s in Belfast.  How was the Welsh language commission able to achieve this?  What is the role of the private sector?<\/p><p> On the transition from schemes to statutory standards, I take it that the delegates are talking about a rights-based model which gives people a right to do things in their own language.  How long will the transition take and how will it work?  The delegates invited a question on the length of the language schemes and I will ask it.  They said they would have more to tell us about the length being increased from three to seven years.  I am interested in this issue.<\/p><p> On the practical side of things, the point made by Mr. Julian de Sp&aacute;inn is an important one.  He might correct me, but either 3% or 6% of staff in the administrative section of the Department of Education and Skills are proficient in Irish.<\/p> <p>Was it 3% in the Department who were proficient in Irish?  The Department of Education and Skills is probably one of the most crucial when we talk about the development of the language, but Mr. de Sp&aacute;inn might correct me on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500007#G00500","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416919500,"counter":155,"content":"<p>It is 1.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Julian de Sp&aacute;inn"},{"type":"speech","time":1416919500,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Tuilleadh gearrtha siar.

He raised the question of influencing or offering advice to Welsh Ministers on legislation.  The relevant section is section 4 of our measure which has proved very useful in the past two to two and a half years.  It is a statutory requirement for Welsh Ministers to pay due regard to any statutory advice we offer to them and to which they have to respond.  Of course, the words \"due regard\" can mean many things to many people, but at least they are included in the legislation which we have used extensively in past years.  We choose when we use it, but we have used it in dealing with social welfare legislation, including specifically a piece of social care legislation which has now received royal assent, when we used it to ensure the language was seen as a key requirement.  It had not been referred to in the legislation or in the discussion on the floor of the committee when it was said: \"Of course it will be there.\"  However, we argued that unless it was on the face of the legislation, it would not be there and succeeded in giving advice and offering amendments to the legislation.  <\/p><p>  We are in a similar and very interesting position on a new planning Bill for Wales which seeks to address a host of technical and policy issues.  We have offered statutory written advice, but we are also going to the scrutiny committee in two weeks time to offer it again.  It is the case that our advice has to be given \"due regard\".  It is a very useful tool in terms of our influence.  We have also used it at Westminster, but its key use has been in terms of legislation in Wales.  As I said, we target it and it is a case of ensuring the Welsh language is referred to, where appropriate, on the face of Welsh legislation.  Section 4 has been very useful within our legislation.<\/p><p>  On the various sectors involved, the Senator asked about the transition from schemes to standards.  It is going to be a long journey, about that there is no question.  The first 26 organisations will be drawn into the standards sphere next year.  We have just commenced the statutory process of bringing in the next 120 and have already identified the next 250.  Therefore, by the end of my period as commissioner, I expect to see in the region of 600 to 800 organisations included.  What is interesting is that, by that time, we will have extended outside the public sector into the voluntary sector.  As we increasingly see services being delivered by the voluntary sector and the third sector through the subcontracting out of health services, social welfare services and other services in Wales, it is very important that the standards are imposed on these sectors also.<\/p> <p> By the end of my period as commissioner, which lasts seven years and I am nearly three years into that, I expect we will have started to address, through statutory processes, the business or private sectors that have been named in the legislation.  In the first instance, energy companies have been named, water is already in so that means energy, telecommunications and those service delivery sectors within the private sector.<\/p><p> Members asked about carrots and sticks.  The committee will notice that I have not mentioned the retail sector and it has not been named in the legislation.  Banking has also not been named in our legislation.  Our approach is slightly different in those sectors.  It is a combination of strong carrots in regard to talking to organisations about the economic and marketing advantages of delivering services in a bilingual country.  We have done a fair bit of research in that area which shows that service users or customers are attracted to services that are delivered bilingually.<\/p><p> Alongside a strong incentive there is an element of name and shame.  Fairly recently, in Wales,  service delivery in Welsh by very large international supermarkets was not as strong as one would have expected.  We intervened at the highest level with their chief executives.  We indicated to them not the error of their ways but the opportunities being missed and we have had a very positive response.  <\/p><p> In terms of the public sector, and increasingly the third sector and over time in the business sector, we will have statutory powers.  I was asked what those statutory powers are and the financial ombudsman was mentioned.  As commissioner, I will have capacity to impose financial sanctions for non-compliance, a route I hope I will not have to follow too often.  I hope the tactic of name and shame and claims of a lack of regard for the public will bear greater influence.  There is the possibility of financial sanctions which, I admit, are not huge but they do exist.  We are moving towards a very different environment.<\/p><p> Quotas were mentioned.  Within language schemes in Wales we have not used quotas in the way that Members spoke about in regard to State bodies.  The requirement, which is embedded in most language schemes, is a skills audit and having a very formalised procedure to identify which posts require which level of language capacity.  Rather than identifying a number it is a case of looking at the entire workforce and identifying what skills, where and to what intensity.  Over time where such analysis is done well that has become standard practice.  There are some good examples in Wales.  I mentioned to the committee, on our visit, the work that the North Wales Police force has undertaken.  All members of the North Wales Police force now require a certain level of language capacity.  This varies according to the role but the requirement is integrated across the institution rather than being a quota.  The fear about quotas, in many respects, is that they will be in the wrong places at the wrong time.  Having an integrated assessment of language requirement across an organisation per post is the ideal.  Where that initiative has been done well in Wales it has proved to be very beneficial.  The scheme is not perfect and I do not admit that it is perfect.  We challenge organisations, on a regular basis, as to how they have made decisions about certain posts.<\/p> <p>That has been formalised over time.<\/p><p> I am not sure whether I omitted to answer any of the questions raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500009#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Meri Huws","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416920100,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Will Ms Huws comment on the proposed duration of the schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500011#L00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416920100,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I note that head 7, which details the proposed section 14, refers to moving the duration of schemes from three years to seven.

When it comes to public sector organisations, change is constant.  My concern is that a seven-year scheme would not be sufficiently flexible.  Reference was made to there being opportunities to call in the schemes and ask that they be amended, but that would have to be exceptional.  I would be very concerned if it were a statutory requirement that organisations move from three to seven years.

There is some concern in Government that to do the same here would send motorists crashing into each other.

In terms of quantitative measures, the census is a particularly useful one.  We were disappointed that the latest census showed a slight drop in the numbers indicating a capacity in the Welsh language; after going over the 20% mark, we have now dipped back below it.  The census figures are still being unwrapped and we have seen only the very high-level data.  However, we are starting to move now to the more granular information.  What is very interesting is the indication of a growth in the numbers of young people who have some capacity in the language.  That is something we need to grasp.  As a consequence of Welsh-medium education, we are seeing an increasing capacity.  Whether we are then harnessing that and moving it forward into the workforce is another question.  There is a major issue for us around third level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500011#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Meri Huws"},{"type":"speech","time":1416920100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>What percentage of children in Wales receive Welsh-medium education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500011#L00600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416920100,"counter":166,"content":"<p>There are different levels, but almost all schoolchildren will have some experience of the Welsh language.  It varies from school to school to some extent.  Many will go through the Welsh-medium education, but there are different grades in different areas.  I will be happy to send the latest information to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>Census figures show growth among young people and in geographic areas where traditionally the language did not exist in the past century.  There has been growth in Cardiff, the main city, and places like Swansea but there has been a diminution in the traditional heartlands in the west.  This is a measure of change, rather than success or failure.  It is a challenge and we must work with these figures.<\/p><p> Other measures are more qualitative and it is difficult to measure things in terms of levels of awareness.  I have worked in the language sphere for many years - officially for the past three years but prior to that in the realm of the Welsh Language Board.  The aim is to increase the level of awareness that Wales is a bilingual nation among employers and organisations.  For example, next week, at the Welsh agricultural winter fair, we will give a presentation on the use of bilingual branding on food and drink in Wales.  The growth in awareness is somewhat imperceptible but it exists.<\/p><p> In terms of inter-generational activity, most project-based promotional work occurs within the Welsh Government and this has been the case for the past three years, since the establishment of the commissioner's office.  There was a division of roles - the statutory regulatory role went to the commissioner and the promotional role went to the Welsh Government.  The Twf scheme, a well-established programme, encourages young parents to speak Welsh.  Under the Twf scheme young mothers are congratulated around the point of birth on bringing a young Welsh person into the world and bilingualism is encouraged.  Some soft projects emanate from the Welsh Government and, alongside statutory measures, have an impact on the qualitative experience of being in Wales.<\/p><p> Regarding road signs, I do not think we have figures on casualties and fatalities.  The road sign debate has persisted since my early teens and that period was a long time ago.  We have moved towards bilingual road signs and safety concerns are raised occasionally but there is no evidence that it leads to higher casualties than in any other bilingual country.  As an organisation, we recently re-published our guidelines on bilingual design.  I will send a copy of this to the committee as it may interest the members to see how we create safe bilingual signage and brands.<\/p><p> Questions on funding levels have been asked of the Welsh Government recently.  I have an annual budget of &pound;3.6 million but all language budgets in Wales are facing cuts.  I will happily provide the committee with the latest figures released by the Welsh Government on funding the Welsh Language Commission and Welsh language activity generally as they may be useful.<\/p><p> I do not believe I met the Minister previously but I would be very happy to meet any Irish Ministers who might find such a meeting useful.  I know that a meeting took place previously with the First Minister of Wales.<\/p><p> An interesting question was asked on the general health of the Welsh language and, to some extent, my answer depends on the day of the week.  These are challenging times for minority languages in a globalised world where majority languages dominate.<\/p> <p>Increasingly, we have a move in Wales towards thinking about being a country in which people are bilingual which, in terms of policy development, would have implications for means of operation and service delivery.  Over time - I do not want to be too positive about this - it has become a question not of why we are doing this but of how we do it.  The one area in which I have seen this very significant change is health and social care, in which a general level of awareness has emerged among practitioners and providers of health and social care services that communication through the medium of Welsh is not just a fad but actually a clinical requirement.  It is coming to be understood that delivery through both English and Welsh, on the basis of an active offer instead of the patient having to demand it, is part of a good solid health service.  We are seeing significant change in some very important areas, but there are still huge challenges and that posed by the workforce is one of our biggest.  How do we ensure young people coming through the Welsh-medium education system will flow out into the workforce and that they will not see the Welsh language just as a subject they have to study but as a skill for the future?  There is a real challenge in the way we teach Welsh at both second and third level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500011#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Meri Huws","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416920700,"counter":169,"content":"<p>As Ms Huws noted, we had a very focused and open meeting with the Welsh First Minister who was exceptionally gracious on the occasion.

That is something we should consider implementing as part of the role of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.<\/p> <p>I am more interested in the general health of the language.  I got a phone call the other day from Donegal.  Like Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, I had been talking about how the mn&aacute; t&iacute; should get a few bob extra.  This guy rang me and said \"You'll never get another vote.  The Irish language is a waste of time - forget about it.\"  My answer to him was that I never got that many votes anyway, so it would not affect me greatly.  Then I went into Bonner's pub in Kincasslagh during the summer.  I had been there many years before and I was stunned because all the people at the bar were conversing fluently in English.  It stunned me.  I could not believe it.  That just knocked me out.<\/p><p> We can have all the legal frameworks we like but it is like putting spinach on the school dinners and leaving it there and the spinach might be there but it will never be eaten.  We must look on it that way.  I am doing a study for the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection on effective Irish in primary schools, because it has reached a crisis point.  I would be very interested in that document Ms Huws is sending to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  She was talking about leaving Irish in a discrete box.  It will not work.  This strategy is not working in primary schools either.  Without coming up with the result before I have done the investigation, I would like Ms Huws's opinion on this.  I know it might be a wee bit outside her role, but I would like her opinions on that.  That is the most important thing for me. <\/p><p> I have relatively young children, in their early teens, and they listen to Spin and iRadio, which are music stations.  It is amazing that the young disc jockeys on these stations speak a bit of Irish all the time.  That is a fabulous way of getting the Irish out among the teenagers.  It makes it cool.  All these radio stations are all at it now.  In fact, I listened to my own local radio station this morning and the disc jockey on their mid-morning music programme was talking half in Irish and half in English.  If we could get that sort of thing going it would be worth its weight in gold.  Next thing, we would get the retailers and the girls or the men at the checkouts using Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500013#N00300","speaker":"1166","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416921000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>We are just about finished, because there are time constraints, but I ask the commissioner to respond to Senator D'Arcy's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN32014112500014#O00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416921000,"counter":173,"content":"<p><i>Diolch yn fawr<\/i>.  I now understand where the &quot;angry men&quot; saying comes from.  One of the major challenges we face is making the language relevant.  In terms of education, one of the challenges in Wales, in which we have not fully succeeded, is making the language something that exists outside the classroom, so that young people can see that it is relevant to plumbing, retail, beauty, health and social care.  Wherever they want to go in the world, they can take the language as a skill with them, and it is an added skill.  This is being done well in Wales, particularly in third level education, although Senator D'Arcy was talking about primary education, where it is being mainstreamed into young people's real interests in life.  This works.<\/p> <p>I have seen courses in which young plumbers are being taught their skills well and are also being encouraged to talk about it, not formally but in their day-to-day Welsh language.  That works.  <\/p><p> Spin Radio was mentioned.  This places the language in a context which is familiar, where they have confidence and where they see it as being cool.  That goes back to an issue the Chairman raised, that of \"active offer\".  It is something that is critical.  The Chairman also talked about service delivery, which, through the medium of Welsh, is improving.  However, if the public are not aware that the services are there, if they are not marketed properly, if they are not evident, or if they have to ask specially, it makes it difficult for an individual to use the service.  It is case of their saying \"Oh, I've got to go and ask for it as well,\" and then it is delivered.  Therefore, active offer is critical for us, so that where services are provided and delivered, they have to be well marketed and made evident.  It is not a case of being given the Welsh form if one asks for it; the Welsh form needs to be there.  The Welsh language nurse or the bilingual receptionist needs to be there.  <\/p><p> That is appropriate from the right-spaced approach, but it also means that people gain confidence and see it as something that is part of what they should expect, rather than what they need to ask for.  One of the things I often hear in Wales is someone saying \"I don't want to upset someone,\" or \"I don't want to ask for the service because I may not get it.\"  I think we have to change that mentality.  <\/p><p> The Chairman mentioned negativity.  We still have pockets of negativity.  I am not painting an absolutely rosy picture.  One still has angry letters in our national newspapers about the language, but that is the reality.  One will always find that element of negativity.

Good planning ensures we get the right development in the right place at the right time.  It makes a positive difference to people's lives and helps to deliver homes, jobs and better opportunities for all.<\/p><p>  I am accompanied by two Irish Planning Institute board members, Mr. John Spain and Mr. Henk van der Kamp, and its executive director, Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Leary.  We submitted to the committee a briefing note detailing three pertinent issues we wished to discuss.  I hope the note provides an effective overview of these issues.<\/p><p>  By way of background, the Irish Planning Institute was founded in 1975 and will celebrate its 40th birthday next year.  It is the all-island professional body representing the majority of professional planners in Ireland and Irish planners working abroad.  The institute's mission is simple, namely, to advance planning and ensure we have a planning system that is fit for purpose and operates in the interests of the common good.  <\/p><p>  I propose, first, to outline the reasons the Irish Planning Institute seeks to continuously raise the standards of planning and the planning profession and professional recognition of planners is important and necessary.  We need a planning system in which members of the public can have confidence.  This cannot be achieved without a system that is transparent and credible.  Planning is a uniquely participatory process.  Members of the public, planners, councillors, architects, engineers, developers and local authority managers all have roles to play in the planning process.  However, these roles are not clear to the public and are sometimes conflicting.  <\/p><p>  The term \"planner\" is randomly used to label and describe all those involved in the planning process, including administrators, lobbyists and members of other professions.  This clearly demonstrates that the role, purpose and function of the professional planner are not fully understood, even in some cases by those working within the planning system.  We need to repair trust in the system, but this cannot be done without first clearly defining those who work within it.  The planning (No. 2) Bill provides an opportunity to create greater clarity around the title of \"planner\" and emphasise that professional planners are suitably qualified.  Such clarification is necessary to ensure members of the public are not misled into believing they are dealing with individuals describing themselves as something they are not.  As competent authority under the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, the Irish Planning Institute is engaging with the Department on fulfilling our obligations to regulate the planning profession. <\/p><p>  The second issue I propose to highlight is the need for certainty and consistency in the making of plans and decisions.  This is necessary to increase confidence and facilitate investment in development.  Ultimately, investors need to know how long the planning process will take, the cost of securing planning permission and whether planning permission that has been secured can be implemented.  Much development in previous years was project-led.  It is critical that we maintain and promote deliverable plan-led development.  <\/p><p>  The Irish Planning Institute calls for the planning system and our vision for growth to be underpinned by the successor to the national spatial strategy.  A new national planning framework, setting out a spatial vision for the country, is required as a matter of urgency.  It must focus on promoting the country's assets and achieving synergies to maximise the potential of the different parts of Ireland.  The optimal use of different parts of the country needs to be spatially highlighted.  The proposed Government planning policy statement on the aims and purpose of the system is also urgently required.  <\/p><p>  The final issue we propose to address is the detailed mechanics of the planning system, some of which are likely to be amended in the forthcoming planning (No. 1) Bill.   The planning system in Ireland has rigorous timelines and is uniquely participatory.  However, as with most systems, there is always room for improvement.  For example, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's 18 week statutory timeframe needs to be reassessed.  Part V negotiations and agreement on the provision of social housing need to be more effective and should be afforded statutory timelines binding on the relevant local authority and developer.  Submissions on compliance with conditions need to be effectively dealt with and a statutory timeline afforded to their consideration.  <\/p><p>  Other issues and mechanisms must also be considered.  For instance, consideration should be given to the introduction of certificates of lawfulness of use or development instead of the current section 5 declarations.  Furthermore, strategic development zones' planning schemes should be subject to annual review to ensure they can be implemented.  <\/p><p>  The responsibility does not solely rest with the overseers of the planning system.  If the system is to work effectively, consumers must also adapt and show flexibility.  The system must adapt to changing circumstances and trends and, above all, increase standards.  Developers must be flexible to adapt their developments to ensure the best possible scheme can be implemented to best suit current and future populations.  <\/p><p>  The planning system can help to underpin economic recovery, without fear of repeating past mistakes and in order that all sectors involved in the built environment can function together in a wider sustainable environment.  Last October marked the 50th anniversary of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963.  It is timely that we are considering changes to the governing legislation.  Debates continue on whether the system has served as well.  While we must learn from the past and ensure similar mistakes are not repeated, we must also look to the future.  The forthcoming planning Bills provide an opportunity to ensure we have a planning system that is fit for purpose and the best fit to guide development for the next 50 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1416924900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hughes and her colleagues for coming before the joint committee.  One of the main recommendations of the Mahon tribunal was the establishment of an independent planning regulator.  Does the Irish Planning Institute have a view on whether this recommendation should be implemented?<\/p><p>  Ms Hughes has stated a national planning framework is required to succeed the national spatial strategy.  Based on what has emanated from the Department to date, is she hopeful work on developing such a framework is under way?<\/p><p>  Zoning in Dublin and larger towns is a widely discussed issue, as is the need to prioritise category 1 and 2 areas.  On planning in rural areas, especially the issue of village consolidation, in some counties small amounts of land close to the centre of villages have been zoned.  While I consider this to be the correct approach, some planners may frown on the practice on the basis that people should be pushed into larger towns.  In approximately 20 villages and ten towns there are rural transport systems in place.<\/p> <p>It is easy for people to move about from those villages to the larger towns.  It is also about trying to keep those villages sustainable, as there are people living in villages that are closed down and one cannot buy a litre of milk or a sliced pan.  This means people are driving five or ten miles to buy daily necessities.  Some counties zoned land close to the centre of villages to try to increase population and reduce the dependency on one-off houses beyond the edge of a village.  Will the witnesses provide a view on that?  A certain amount of this was done in County Laois, and some of it was okay for villages like Clonaslee, Ballyroan and Ballylinan.  Some of those developments are well within the immediate vicinity of the village and have helped to make the village more sustainable in some cases.<br\/>The size of apartments is an issue that arises repeatedly.  There is a view that reducing apartment size or density standards is unlikely to stimulate housing growth, so what is the view of the delegation?  I am not an expert but in the few other countries I have visited, apartments seem to be much larger.  Balconies in this country tend to look like a small cattle crush fastened to the side of a building.  They tend to be made from galvanised iron.  If they were on the first storey, they could be used as cattle crushes.  They look odd and they do not provide for sustainable family living.  Even if one wanted to put out a deck chair or clothes horse on a sunny day, it might not be possible.  What is the view of witnesses on apartment sizes?<br\/>What do the witnesses think about quality of apartments?  Building regulations may not be the domain of the delegation but those regulations allow apartments to be separated by plaster slabs.  I know little about construction but I know from experience that if a person is living in an apartment where neighbours are separated by two plaster slabs, there is not much privacy.  I remember canvassing in the corridor of a block of apartments and I could hear a radio from four doors away.  When the person with the radio opened the door as I called, the radio was not much louder than it had been in the corridor.  I have discussed this with officials from the Department but I have been told it is legal.  Nevertheless, I have serious concerns.  I have seen diagrams of how smoke and flames can be deflected in the event of a fire but I am not convinced such a system is as good as a wall constructed with six-inch or four-inch blocks, let alone nine-inch blocks.  This relates to soundproofing, privacy and fire safety.  Does the Irish Planning Institute have a view on this?  There were chicken boxes built in Portlaoise which sold for up to &euro;250,000, and people were paid to queue overnight to buy some of these obnoxious apartments.  People with more money than sense paid those people to stay overnight in order that the apartments could be bought.  It is indicative of how we ended up.<br\/>Does the IPI have the opinion that we should move towards better quality apartments?  I do not have a problem <i>per se<\/i>with apartments where there is a demand for them, particularly near transport hubs, urban centres and close to employment.  I can see the need to work in a sensible fashion in that regard.  I saw balconies in Rome which appeared to be a small garden.  They seemed to be five metres long and four or five metres wide.  They seemed huge but they were not attached to penthouses.  The proletariat lived in such apartments.  Could we move to such a model?  What is the IPI's views on separating dwellings with plaster slabs?  In one apartment block, one neighbour had a row with another and put a foot through the wall.  I saw the hole in the wall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500004#D00300","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416925500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley raised a number of issues and I will try to go through them.  The first concerned a regulator's office.  The IPI wholeheartedly supports the establishment of a regulator and fundamentally believes such a regulator should be independent.  If a decision is taken that the regulator would not be independent, there should be complete transparency in the direction and processes under which the regulator would function.  It is very important that we have a transparent and credible planning system, and we see the establishment of the office of the planning regulator as a fundamental catalyst in enhancing public confidence in the planning system.  The office of the regulator should have and fulfil a research function and role.  The housing crisis emanating today indicates a lack of joined-up thinking and research when it comes to housing provision supply and demand, and the regulator's office would also fulfil that important function.<\/p><p>  My colleagues will address the issues relating to the national spatial scheme and rural housing, so I will skip to the issue of apartment sizes.  The IPI believes we need quality developments and that we cannot compromise standards or afford to go back to the apartment sizes and the lack of quality in developments prevalent in the 1990s.  This is exemplified by the shoebox apartments constructed, particularly under the urban renewal schemes in the 1990s.  The Department has published minimum apartment sizes which are guidelines to which all local authorities have regard and which they implement.  Recently, the media and lobbyists have called for a reduction in those standards.  If there is one message we would like to get across today, it is that quality development is of the utmost importance.  There is a need for a variety of house types and apartment sizes and it is very important that we ultimately have quality development that can be flexible not only to meet current needs but those which may arise in future.<\/p><p>  Mr. Henk van der Kamp will address the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416925500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question of what we expect of the next national spatial strategy.  We would like to be optimistic but we must be realistic and consider what was contained in the last strategy.  We are part of an institute of professional planners dealing with spatial planning.  The next spatial strategy, if anything, should be spatial, which means it should be about choice and deciding where things go in the country.  It should recognise that some areas have strengths for some types of activities, whereas other areas are particularly suitable for other activities.  We welcome explicit and consistent identification of areas for particular purposes.  In doing that, synergies can be achieved, as noted in our statement, to maximise the potential of different parts of the island for energy, landscape protection, housing and agriculture and other activities.  Very often, land users can work together to provide these kinds of synergies, and this is what should be addressed by the national spatial strategy.  In this context, a landscape strategy is essential, along with a coastal management policy for the coastline and foreshore area.<\/p><p>  I will address the Deputy's question about rural areas and villages.  It is not for the national spatial strategy to dictate which village grows and which does not.  That is a matter for a local county council and its county development plan.  The planning system should continue to be based on the subsidiarity principle that what can be determined locally should be determined locally.<\/p> <p>What the Deputy referred to in terms of smaller villages taking their share in accommodating growth by zoning areas near the centre perhaps is something that would fit into a settlement strategy determined at a local level.  We fully support that idea and that principle.  We welcome development in villages.  The settlement strategy needs to be consistent with the higher level strategies adopted in the regional planning guidelines and ultimately in the national spatial strategy.  We sometimes refer to this as the Russian dolls - the planning hierarchy.  Local planning needs to fit in regional planning strategies and the national planning strategies.  There is a link between the national spatial strategy and ultimately which village gets disowned.  It is just a link of logic, not a link of determination at national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henk van der Kamp","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416926100,"counter":192,"content":"<p>In relation to the separation of apartments and the destruction of them, we have seen disengagement and the problems caused at Priory Hall where planning allowed apartments to be constructed without using solid walls to separate one dwelling from the next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500006#F00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926100,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Could the witness respond to that point, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500006#F00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416926100,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Ultimately it comes back to quality development.

I related to much of what Deputy Stanley said and agree wholeheartedly with his remarks about apartments.  I think there is a definite place for apartments but the whole idea has not been sold well due to the lack of quality in some of what has been provided.  That has partly to do with the construction but also with the whole management system.  I come from an area where we have experience of strategic development zones, SDZs, and would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses in terms of their continued usefulness, as I would be broadly in favour of them from what I have seen.  That ties in with my second point.  It strikes me that to date so much of our planning has been reactive and that there has not really been a plan for a town.  I remember walking around the town of Ennis which I did not know particularly well about three years ago and being struck by the beauty of its centre.  I then moved out to the areas developed since the 1960s, the quality of which was so inferior to the town centre.  There is a rather haphazard surround to a beautiful town centre which, sadly, is true of so many places in this country.  This means we need a longer term forward-planning approach.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that in respect of new legislation or changes that ought to be made.  I would also be interested in a comment on how we can best deal with the problems of infill in towns and cities from Dublin to smaller towns around the country and how the areas that are becoming derelict can be turned around.

Obvious examples of that are in south Dublin, such as Adamstown which has worked to a point and is now being revised to try to get it going again within the current context.  That is highlighted in terms of new legislation.  Some improvements are needed to address the lack of flexibility in SDZs.  There is a need for a much better co-ordinated and joined-up approach.  They need to be able to change as circumstances change.  One legislative amendment that is required is to have a fast-track mechanism for bringing forward amendments to planning schemes.  At the moment there is no mechanism for an amendment; one has to go through the same process as in drawing up a planning scheme for a strategic development zone.  That is an issue the Department is looking at under Construction 2020 and we welcome that.<\/p><p>  Another key issue that needs to be addressed is the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la because there is no third party role in appeal rights, or even first party appeal rights, within planning applications within a strategic development zone.  The appeal process on the planning scheme is very important.  At the moment the board has a very limited role because it is restricted by the 2010 Act to making only minor changes to planning schemes.  Therefore, there is a danger that we end up with schemes that are, perhaps, sub-optimum in the board&rsquo;s view because it is not able to take on board the submissions made by interested parties during the process and translate those into decisions involving amendments, other than minor amendments to the scheme.

Ms Mary Hughes mentioned the need for an annual review process within SDZs to review how the scheme is working and to see what changes are needed as it is being implemented, particularly in rapidly changing economic circumstances.  Linked to that is the planning scheme and the funding process for development levies.  There should be a much closer tie-in between the section 48 development levies and the planning scheme.

This is done in a county development plan, but more likely through a local area plan, which is already included in current legislation.  We suggest strongly that we should provide for more of this in the new planning Bill.  In other words, we should have more local area plans and more forward planning for an area before development takes place and even before the pressures arise.  We should think about how the area should develop and set that out in writing in a clear plan.<br\/>We should also minimise the procedural obstacles afterwards for the implementation of the plan.  This is where the development sector comes in.  A plan of itself is not the implementation.  The implementation happens through developers submitting proposals, coming together and making development contributions which will facilitate the infrastructure.  Our institute has observed that some obstacles to development could be removed, for example, in terms of length of planning application procedures, development contribution impediments, phasing and clarity of conditions attached to planning permissions.  In other words, we must try to minimise the obstacles.  Once a decision has been made in accordance with the plan, the development should go ahead.<br\/>We would like to emphasise that there are advantages and benefits for society in adopting a plan-led rather than a development-led approach.  A development-led approach is one where the planning system responds to project proposals from developers in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner.  This does not necessarily mean it makes bad decisions, but it deals with each application on its own.  A plan-led approach lays down a framework for development so that the development sector has certainty and predictability.  This does not only apply to housing development, but also to wind energy products, industrial and commercial development, etc.  Our planning system provides for much of this already, but there is room for significant improvement in regard to the implementation phase and planning permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henk van der Kamp"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The Irish Planning Institute presentation commenced by saying there has been some confusion in regard to planning and that although people tend to talk about the area as a combined entity, there are separate roles and many different players.  I understand that as I have spent many days trying to explain to people how things are done.  It is obvious significant work needs to be done on various levels.<\/p><p>  I believe we need forward planning.  The national spatial strategy is a critical part of the hierarchy.  When the regional planning guidelines knitted into the national spatial strategy, this produced a change in culture within the local authorities.  I noticed a major change in culture within Kildare County Council when people fitted into that more strategic approach.  However, does the institute accept that we cannot have a purely spatial strategy and that there must be some sort of dovetailing with the national development plan?  Large initiatives, such as transportation planning, must dovetail if we are to have rational planning.  Should these planning strategies happen in conjunction with each other?<\/p><p>  The sequence of events is important.  I find it frustrating that some of the other legislation required, such as the building control Bill, the planning (No. 2) Bill and Bills such as the one I produced seeking greater transparency, have not been passed.  People would be astounded if they looked back at what happened in 2008 and realised that we have not spent the intervening years getting what went wrong right before the construction industry kicked off again.  I do not believe we are anywhere near getting it right.  We are now back at the point of looking at introducing incentives for developers.  I find this incredibly frustrating.  We tend to make our decisions at a crisis point which is part of the reason for criticism of decisions, such as on the size of apartments now that we have a housing shortage.  The industry will obviously argue its own corner and explain how it can do more for less and how more money can be made from development.  However, we are constantly making decisions at a time of crisis, rather than planning ahead to prevent a crisis. <\/p><p>  I want to address a number of specific issues.  In the new (No. 1) Bill, it is proposed there will be a register of planning permissions and if they are not taken up within three years, they will expire.  This is to reduce the length of time and before development commences and to ensure people do not sit on land.  This is fine, provided all the elements required to develop the land stack up, including water and wastewater treatment systems and so on.  The issue is not as simple as dealing with people sitting on planning permissions granted.<\/p><p>  We also need to have a compliance register in regard to enforcement notices.  This must happen at national level because of the movement of people who are non-compliant from one area to another.  I am aware of the time, effort and energy that goes into compliance in planning departments, such as taking issues relating to warning or enforcement notices as far as the courts.  It is unbelievable that we do not use this information at national level.  I am curious to hear the institute's views on that.  I believe we should reward good behaviour.  Good developers who do not engage in bad practice are not rewarded, because there is no overall overview of the situation and non-compliant bad developers can move from one area to another.  Therefore, sequence is important.<\/p><p>  The institute mentioned Part V and the conditions in this are to be changed in the (No. 1) Bill.  I have some concerns about this.  How would the institute like to see the provisions for this stated in legislation?  Will the witnesses flesh out its views on timelines and so on?  I believe a real mess has been made of the issue of development contributions.  For example, a circular issued in December 2013 more or less told local authorities they could not apply water or wastewater development contributions, because these were now the function of Irish Water.  Now, Irish Water does not have that function and this critical income source is compromised, at least for 12 months.  What role does the institute see for development contributions?  These contributions vary throughout the country.  Do the contributions need to be rationalised?  The cost of building a water or wastewater facility or a road will not vary significantly from one part of the country to another.<\/p> <p>I am curious about that.  We are now at a point where we are discussing reducing development contributions to stimulate development.  What do the witnesses think their functions should be?  The 2006 Act on strategic development dealt with major infrastructural projects.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la deals with that.  I have no problem with that if it is the Luas.  However, there are matters such as wind farms, for example, where technology and information have moved on since 2006.  We are facing a situation where guidelines will be produced but the applications will be made before that, so people are shooting in the dark when making the application.  Do the witnesses think matters such as that should be positioned more at local government level, where there is an appeals mechanism?  Does that Act go too far and does it weaken the position for the public in terms of not having an appeals mechanism on something like that and where the technology is changing?  That has become a real bone of contention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500007#G00300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416927300,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy raised a number of issues.  With regard to her observations about confusion within the system and, indeed, relating to the correlation between strategic infrastructure plans, such as the national development plan, county development plans and regional plans, the Irish Planning Institute has long been calling for publication of the Government&rsquo;s planning policy statement setting out the aims and objectives of the planning system and how that can affect different provisions within different Departments.  We understand from the Department that the planning policy statement is in train.  We consider it quite urgent at this stage because we fundamentally believe that the work of Irish Water or of the Office of Public Works regarding flood mapping and the provision of infrastructure flood protection measures should be influenced by planning and should be aligned to the objectives of, for example, settlement strategy.  Without that planning policy statement the public is not aware of the importance of planning, the objectives of the planning system and where planning and other provisions should be aligned.  That is one important aspect.  We agree that items such as the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and other development plans must all be in line and synchronised together.<\/p><p>  Regarding the register of planning permissions the Deputy mentioned and the indication that they might just be retained for a period of three years, it takes a long time for a potential project to evolve.  It takes a long time for it to advance through the planning system and then a long time to be implemented in terms of compliance with planning conditions and addressing certain key infrastructure.  The Deputy made those points.  One issue that must be seriously examined within the planning Bill, and we referred to it in our opening statement, is compliance with conditions attached to a planning permission and the length of time it is taking for planning authorities to issue compliance with those conditions.  It can take anything from one month to eight months to secure compliance with planning conditions, and it is issues such as these which are an obstacle in the system to implementing development on the ground.<\/p><p>  The Irish Planning Institute wholeheartedly supports the provisions of Part V, particularly the emphasis on the provision of social housing.  There are indications that the Part V provision focusing on social housing might be reduced from 20% to 10%.  Looking at the current system and at how we could potentially improve it, there are difficulties in the system in terms of reaching agreement on the level of Part V that is to be provided.  There is no doubt that securing legal agreement on any development issue can take a huge amount of time.  However, at present, it is quite an impediment, and it has been in the past, to delivering infrastructure projects on the ground.  There must be some mechanism for negotiating Part V agreements.  They must be embedded in some form of statutory timeline process to ensure that the matters can be dealt with in a timely and effective manner.<\/p><p>  There are pros and cons as to whether the Part V proposal should be dealt with pre-planning or post-planning.  There are merits in it being dealt with pre-planning from the point of view that one plans for the social housing provision as part of one&rsquo;s planning application and one gets the house type and size right.  However, progressing and negotiating a Part V agreement pre-planning will involve time delays.  It is another bureaucratic system or process that one will have to deal with before lodging for planning.  That is a time constraint in itself.  If one does it post-planning permission or when the planning permission is issued, one can address the Part V issue when one is dealing with compliance with other conditions associated with one&rsquo;s planning permission.  There can be a time saving there.  The difficulty, of course, is that it could be a case that a planning permission has been issued that is perhaps not suitable for the purposes of social housing or for the social need of that particular area.<\/p><p>  Another issue relating to Part V that probably requires consideration is to provide more definite notice of the requirements in advance of any potential developer coming to the table.  Indeed, DKM undertook a report on the Part V process and it consulted the public in that regard.  One of its recommendations was that perhaps we could identify and have more clearly defined areas within development plans where a specific social housing need was required or particular housing types were required.<\/p><p>  The objective of Part V should be to create greater clarity in the system in terms of what is provided and therefore to encourage and facilitate the process as much as possible, as opposed to becoming a burdensome issue.  We have concerns about other issues and how they will be addressed, for example, if the 10% social housing is a mandatory provision, how that will be applied to smaller schemes and how it will work out.  There must be some element of flexibility within the system for it to be implementable on the ground, but there is certainly no easy solution to it.<\/p><p>  I will ask my colleagues to reply on development contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416927300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>We agree that further work must be done to improve the operation of the development contribution system.  It is fundamentally a sound principle, but it has been in place for approximately ten years and we must review how it works in practice.  There has been a review of the level at which development levies are set throughout the country and there are now lower levels, but many planning permissions were granted when the levels were higher and at levels which make development unviable.  One of the provisions in the new planning Bill is that the new levels would apply retrospectively and we certainly support that.  It must happen.  It would enable planning permissions to be activated and help to deliver housing supply in the short term.<\/p><p>  There must also be greater consistency throughout the country as there is considerable inconsistency, as the Deputy said.  There must also be a more sophisticated approach to levies in terms of looking at different types of development more carefully.  Many local authorities have a single levy for commercial development, for example.  The ability to sustain such a levy is very different for a town centre retail scheme as opposed to a large floor plate industrial scheme.<\/p> <p>Levies need to be more sophisticated and consider the types and locations of development.  Levies should be applied and ring-fenced to provide the infrastructure and community and transport facilities they are designed to provide, not go into a general pool of expenditure.

The witnesses are very welcome.  When we were discussing who would come in to discuss the new planning Bill, I made sure the IPI's name was included as a priority.  Given that there have been 50 years of modern Irish planning since the last Planning Act, it is time for a new Bill.  The witnesses referred to the term &ldquo;planner&rdquo; and the need to ensure everybody is qualified.  University qualification is the academic requirement.  Is continuous professional development the only side the witnesses want to put into legislation?  The witnesses mentioned the optimal use of different parts of the country to maximise the island's potential, and much of that already happens under planning regulations in various development plans.  I know the landscape strategy, and witnesses' suggestion that energy infrastructure for renewable energy would be mandatory in any future development plans is a good recommendation.<\/p><p>  The witnesses elaborated on Part 5, and it is the most important part, particularly with the homeless numbers and the housing situation.  Could the witnesses identify one thing we should be doing now to speed up the process that would put houses on the ground, particularly social housing and housing for the homeless?  The statutory provision requiring planning authorities to resolve compliance submissions within a specific timeframe should be put in place.  Each planning authority should have a time limit in which to enforce compliance.  Personnel in the local authorities should be designated to do the enforcement.  Local authorities fall down on enforcement.<\/p><p>  The witnesses recommended that certificates of lawfulness of use of development be introduced.  What would they cover?  The planning review of various local authorities that reported in 2012 made 12 specific recommendations.  Mr. van der Kamp did an independent review of the review and rejected some of the recommendations.  It is important to hear them.  One recommendation with which he disagreed was the requirement that developers be banned from making local area plans.  Everybody should be involved in some way in making local area plans, because everybody brings different knowledge, including the community, developer and planner.  Could Mr. van der Kamp comment on the proposal that developers be banned from making local area plans?

North of a line from Louth to Galway, there are no motorways, there is poorer connectivity and there has been less investment in towns over the lifetime of our national spatial strategy.  To what extent have we achieved balanced regional development since the Celtic tiger when money was spent on infrastructure?  What might the witnesses change about the designation of towns as gateways and hubs?  What could we do to accelerate the sort of development we would like to see in these areas?  What can be done to redress the imbalance?  I am from County Mayo.<\/p><p>  It is an aspiration that all planning would dovetail.  We constantly refer to our Food Harvest 2020 targets, which aim to ramp up agricultural production.  Much of it is based on our pasture land for feeding our animals, which is unique to us.  On the other hand, we have energy targets for electricity and energy crops.  Although I have not seen it seriously happen, in my home county people are being encouraged to grow willow for the generation of electricity.  On the other hand, we want more cattle and are abolishing the dairy quota next year.  To what extent have these competing interests been examined?  What are the guiding principles?  Is it purely over to the Government of the day, or can there be a more rounded approach?  Have any of the Departments examined how to deal with competing interests, what it might mean and who might have to cut back on their objectives?  Maybe that will not have to happen.

Currently, a person can describe himself or herself as a planner and provide planning services but not be a member of any institute and not necessarily have any education in planning.  This means there is no consistency in terms of standard of knowledge or ethics.  All our members are subject to a code of ethics and continuous professional development, which we believe are important for high quality professionals.

There are also sufficient planning permissions but these are not being implemented.  There are a number of measures set out in Construction 2020 which should be incorporated into the planning Bill as well as into policy.  We would generally support those measures which will help speed up the delivery of housing.  There are many issues arising outside planning.  Issues such as financing, funding, resourcing and the ability of developers to build houses also need to be addressed.  These are also dealt with in other parts of Construction 2020.<\/p><p>  On compliance, we have highlighted this as an area that needs to be properly codified and speeded up in terms of the timescale within which decisions are made.  We would agree with the view that there has been a long-standing gap in planning practice in that enforcement has always fallen far short of what it should be.  There have been some improvements in this area in the past five to ten years but enforcement still falls short of what it should be.  This is primarily down to the resourcing of planning departments to ensure priority is given to enforcement matters.  If planning is not enforced, it loses its effectiveness.  <\/p><p>  In terms of certificates of lawfulness, this concept arises from a need to tidy up gaps and failures in existing legislation to provide people with a mechanism whereby they can obtain certainty as to whether something they propose to do in terms of development is compliant with planning or even requires planning permission.  It is important there is a clear decision in that regard, on which people can rely.  Currently, this is addressed by way of section 5 certificates.  However, some difficulties have arisen in that while a land owner could obtain from a local authority a section 5 certificate in respect of a proposed development another party can make an application in respect of the same development to the local authority and then appeal that to the board, the result being a contrary decision.  This means there can be two contrary decisions on one matter, which leads to uncertainty for people.  The legislation was never intended to be used in this way and so it needs to be tidied up.  The way to address this is, we suggest, through certificates of lawfulness in respect of a proposed use or development.  This would also address the issue of a use which has been in existence for more than seven years and is beyond enforcement.  It is not possible to enforce against a development after seven years unless it is in breach of a condition on use.  This means that because such developments are not lawful but cannot be enforced against the situation remains in limbo.  A certificate of lawfulness would enable that to be tidied up and would again provide certainty to people in making a decision in respect of a property investment.  <\/p><p>  On local area plans, these should of course be prepared by the planning authority rather than developers.  There are cases where developers have prepared plans.  This arises because of resource failings within the local authority.  It is important local authorities have the resources to prepare plans.  Obviously, the local authorities are the statutory bodies responsible for such plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416928500,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Ms Hughes has asked me to respond to the Senator Keane's question, although I do so not wearing my IPI hat.  The reason for that conclusion in the report was based on the distinction between the preferred preparation of a draft plan and the making of a plan.  The making of the plan is the function of the local authority.  The preparation of the plan should be undertaken by the local authority personnel but when this is not possible it may be pragmatic to have consultancy provided.  Effectively, the conclusion was that there is no basic reason that cannot be provided by a developer on behalf of the authority.  However, as I said, the making of the development plan is the function of the local authority.<\/p><p>  On the question regarding balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy, as an institute we believe this is a matter of choice.  Planning is about making choices and that is often difficult.  However, it is the reality.  To make the gateway cities work in any spatial strategy there must be consistency and a concentration of resources in those areas and on development.  Looking back over the national spatial strategy, that was not always done in a consistent manner, which would have weakened the strategy somewhat.  Any future spatial strategy should anticipate those difficulties and build into it a framework to ensure that is addressed.  As stated earlier in our submission, we believe a national spatial strategy should not be solely about gateway cities and towns rather it should also be about the use of different parts of the country for different types of use.  This ties in with the comment in relation to the food versus biomass issue.  Again, this about choice.  We have so many acres of land and must make choices about how we use it.  This is a very good example of the link between sectoral planning and spatial planning.  The Green Paper on Energy addresses the issue of whether biomass should be used for energy purposes.  That will have spatial consequences.  It is a sectoral decision with spatial consequences.  I believe a national spatial strategy will also have to take a view on this because it affects counties like Mayo and other parts of Ireland.  It is ultimately a balancing of the interests of agriculture, food production, the benefits that biomass can bring to our energy palette.  It is important these issues are addressed in a national spatial strategy, which is tied in with the sectoral strategy one energy.  That is an example of how the sectoral and spatial should interact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henk van der Kamp"},{"type":"speech","time":1416928500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Mr. O'Leary, Mr. Spain, Ms Hughes and Mr. van der Kamp for attending today's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500010#K00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416928500,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 16.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Future Plans: Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","time":1416929100,"counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500011#M00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1416929100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>We are resuming the meeting in public session.

Following on from that, I am looking for ways which would improve communication and linkages between the arts officers and other stakeholder bodies.  I understand that the Arts Council is examining new, more informative and transparent ways of presenting information on the combined local authority and Arts Council funding of the arts.  At present, the council&rsquo;s website gives details of all funding distributed to local authorities and to arts organisations in each local authority area.<\/p><p>  Recommendation No. 4 proposes that my Department becomes the primary source of all funding to the arts, both through local authorities and directly to arts organisations.  At present, the Arts Council is the main channel of State support for the arts.  I believe that the Arts Council has served the arts and this country well for over 60 years.  I do not envisage any fundamental change in the institutional arrangements which encompass the arm's length approach of Arts Council distribution of Exchequer funding to the arts.  Expertise on the arts resides in the Arts Council and it is therefore best placed to identify and fund excellence in the arts.  My Department is currently considering this report in more detail.<\/p> <p> I was delighted recently to launch in the GPO Ireland 2016 with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  This is a national initiative led by my Department which will develop, co-ordinate and deliver a programme of activity to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  This programme will be underpinned by the &euro;4 million I secured in the recent budget which will be used to roll out an integrated plan during 2015.  Community involvement is key to having a lasting and meaningful commemoration and the framework launched recently will facilitate that engagement.  In the coming three months a dedicated team in my Department will actively engage with communities, schools, relative groups, colleges, businesses, voluntary organisations, arts and cultural institutions, historical societies and local government.  In conjunction with local authorities, a series of meetings will be held to facilitate \"ground up\" initiatives in order that local communities can get involved and put their own shape on the commemorations as we move towards 2016.  A vibrant culture programme with an international dimension will be finalised in co-operation with the national cultural institutions, the Arts Council of Ireland and Culture Ireland. <\/p><p> The relatives of those who fought and died during the 1916 Rising will play a central role in a number of key State events.  I am engaging actively with this grouping.  I will also be working with the Minister for Education and Skills to develop arts programmes in schools.  We will build on the links developed during The Gathering to reach out to local communities and the Diaspora.  In addition to this, the committee will be aware that earlier this year the Government allocated &euro;22 million - for 2015 - for seven flagship commemorative projects to be finalised in time for Easter 2016.  They include the building of an interpretive centre at the GPO, refurbishment works at the original barracks, the upgrade of Kilmainham Courthouse and Gaol, the restoration of the historical Kevin Barry Room in the National Concert Hall, the development of a new visitor centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc, the restoration of 14 Henrietta Street as a tenement museum and the development of Cathal Brugha Barracks to support a new military service pension archives facility.  Each of these projects will deepen our understanding of the history of the period and provide an enduring and permanent tribute to those involved in the Rising.  <\/p><p> In addition, we published an outline programme of official State events to be held at Easter 2016.  These events will honour those who took part in the Rising in an appropriate and respectful manner.  I will be happy to go into this in more detail if need be.  I look forward to working with the expert advisory group and my colleagues in the Oireachtas all-party consultation group.  I would welcome any view the committee would like to share today.  <\/p><p> That brings me to the issue of the Moore Street national monument.  I share the committee&rsquo;s desire to see a fitting testament to the leaders of the 1916 Rising being put in place on the site.  I will continue to support and encourage efforts to secure progress insofar as it is open to me to do so and it is within my remit under the National Monuments Acts.  As the committee knows from its own interactions in the case, 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts.  The preservation order was put in place in 2007 to protect 16 Moore Street as the site of the final Council of War and the final headquarters of the leaders of the Rising.  To enhance and protect the setting and amenity of 16 Moore Street, the preservation order covers 14, 15 and 17 Moore Street.  As a consequence of the 2007 preservation order, works affecting the monument buildings require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  After extensive deliberations, final consent under the National Monuments Acts was given by my predecessor in April for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and conservation of the structures, both internally and externally.  I am satisfied that the decision made in April provides the means to secure the future of one of the most important sites in modern Irish history.  I have visited the national monument and been through the entire site and surrounding area.  During my visit I spoke to a number of the Moore Street traders who were very supportive of the plans for the monument and the proposals to redevelop the greater area.  <\/p><p> The committee will be aware of the land swap deal that recently was placed before Dublin City Council.  I am disappointed that the members of the council chose not to support this plan which would have released NAMA funding for the development of an appropriate tribute on Moore Street to the leaders and events of the 1916 Rising.  The proposal put before the council provided a real opportunity to have the restoration work completed and the commemorative centre open in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  Following the vote to reject the proposal, it is now a matter for the council and the monument owners to consider the implications for the national monument buildings, the NAMA funding for the proposed restoration project and the centenary commemorations in 2016.  0<\/p><p> The granting of consent under the National Monument Acts completes my Department&rsquo;s function in this case.  I will, however, continue to support all appropriate initiatives to secure the restoration of the national monument, consistent with my statutory function under the National Monuments Acts and the roles and responsibilities of the other interested parties involved.  In that context, I will shortly be meeting the members of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Moore Street advisory committee again to go through the process with them and encourage them to try to advance a solution that will see the restoration project moving forward. <\/p><p> As I mentioned, the 1916 centenary commemorations is a key priority for the Department in the coming year.  I will also be working on the continued development and delivery of a rolling programme of commemorations along the decade of centenaries timeline.  It is also my intention to publish the National Concert Hall Bill and I look forward to receiving the committee&rsquo;s report on it in order that this matter can be progressed as a priority.  Other key priorities for me will be the development of a national cultural policy, Culture 2025, which will set out the high level aims and policies in the area of culture for the period up until 2025.  My Department is drafting a discussion paper which will be published early in the new year to facilitate a public consultation on this offer.  This is the first time in the history of the State that any Government has undertaken such an endeavour.  <\/p><p> I take the opportunity to mention the Arts in Education charter, something I am very eager to progress.  Making the arts more accessible will be a cornerstone of my ministry.  Immersing school students in the arts through a targeted strategy will benefit future generations and give young people a greater understanding and appreciation of the arts as they progress to adulthood.  A high level implementation group chaired by Professor John Coolahan, professor emeritus at NUI, Maynooth, was set up to oversee implementation of the charter.  This group meets very regularly and progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of artists in residence in colleges of education and developing a portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by the group.  <\/p><p> Since the Government took office, a huge effort has also been made to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conversation, SAC, within the framework of the habitats directive.  This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission.  A long-term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss.  The Government published Ireland's first ever draft national peat lands strategy last January and I hope to be in a position to finalise the strategy early in the new year.  It sets out the Government's view on how we can collectively manage our peatlands for many interests, including continued cutting, conservation, recreation and other uses.  It also sets the wide use of peatlands in the context of Ireland's carbon reduction obligations.  My Department will also continue to move forward next year with the national raised bog SAC management plan, the implementation of the compensation scheme which has been extended to raised bog natural heritage area sites and progressing the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs.  On the issue of wider habitats protection, I have recently obtained approval for Ireland's first ever prioritised action plan to focus attention on those protected habitats which need to be improved.  Addressing our peatlands restoration objectives is very much part of this new plan, as are new agri-environment measures being rolled out by the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the green low carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme.<\/p> <p>My Department has worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on these issues to ensure farmers are incentivised to manage our most important habitats in a sustainable manner.  <\/p><p> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, also has a number of priorities regarding the Irish language and Gaeltacht areas.  The cornerstone of Government policy on the Irish language is its 20 year strategy for the period 2010 to 2030.  My Department has an overarching co-ordinating role in implementing the strategy in conjunction with a range of key stakeholders.  Progress is being made in a systematic manner across many measures under the strategy, allowing for the resources available.  My Department is implementing the language planning process under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge.  Priority is being given to the Gaeltacht language planning areas identified for the purposes of the Act.<\/p><p> The committee may be aware that the official languages (amendment) Bill 2014 is on the A list of the Government's legislative programme and is being drafted.  Subject to Government approval, it is hoped the Bill will be published by the end of the year.  Following an extensive public consultation process, the Bill provides for amendments to the Official Languages Act 2003 in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government.  As the committee will be aware, my Department is the joint sponsor, with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, on two North-South Implementation Bodies, Waterways Ireland and the Language Body.  The Departments work together to support the work of the bodies in each jurisdiction.<\/p><p> In addition to progressing North-South co-operation, my key priority is progressing the first stage of the Ulster Canal project from upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson, near Belturbet, County Cavan.  I am working on this with the Government and other key partners, including the North-South Ministerial Council and Waterways Ireland.<\/p><p> My Department continues to fund the provision of essential transport services to the offshore islands as part of its role in assisting the sustainable development of island communities.  I understand the Chairman has a particular interest in the passenger service between Long Island, County Cork, and the mainland.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will be happy to address that matter.  <\/p><p> Regarding offshore islands outside the Gaeltacht, I understand the local and community development programme officially ended at the end of 2013 but is being implemented on a transitional basis until the end of March 2015, pending the roll-out of the new programme, the social inclusion and community activation programme in April 2015.  Officials from my Department have met senior officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss the situation regarding community development offices on non-Gaeltacht islands.  It has been agreed that we will work together to ensure the services they provide are retained and that both Departments will examine ways of supporting the continuation of these vital island structures and services.  I am confident that an appropriate solution will be found in co-operation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for giving me the opportunity to address them today.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I will e happy to answer their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500011#M00600","speaker":"973","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416930300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith s&aacute;sta bheith anseo.

T&aacute; fios agam go bhfuilimid gann ar am ag an bpoinnte seo.<\/p><p>  The Minister's presentation was very helpful and there are five or six issues I would like to raise.  I commend the Minister for stressing the importance of utilising the arts to combat social disadvantage.  Great work was done by members of the committee in producing the report mentioned.  The engagement of the Minister with arts officers around the country indicates the fact that much can be achieved through local authorities.  It is vitally important that members of the public are aware of the benefits accruing from engagement with the arts in all of its manifestations.  The arts can enrich communities and lives.  They can contribute to the renewal and revival of communities and be of economic benefit.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the centenary commemorations.  Nobody doubts the difficulties facing Ministers in striking the right balance in the forthcoming decade of commemorations.  The period 1912 to 1922 was probably the most difficult and fraught in Irish history and it is important that the commemorations are tolerant, inclusive and respectful.  To say the least, the public's response to the 1916 Rising commemoration proposals has been underwhelming.  Looking in from the outside, I have the sense that the Oireachtas advisory committee and the expert panel were not involved to the extent that they might have been.  I understand that on the day the announcement was made a presentation was made to them and I would have expected a more hands-on role for both groups in advising the Government.  It is fair to say the 1916 Rising commemoration video produced has caused deep disappointment around the country.  There has been much reference to it in the national media and it indicates a complete lack of understanding of the events of 1916 and the manner in which they should be commemorated.  It was suggested to me that Google Translate had been used to reproduce the 1916 Proclamation of Independence and I do not believe the signatories to the Proclamation were even mentioned in the video.  It would be fine to use the video to promote Ireland to tourists, but I put it to the Minister that many believe it is not an appropriate commemoration, given the sensitivity and importance of the events of 1916.  Much more could be said about this, but we may not have time to do so.<\/p><p>  I concur with the Minister's remarks about the Moore Street monument and share her disappointment that Dublin City Council recently voted in the way it did.  She has suggested the pragmatic approach of developing houses from 14 to 17 Moore Street.  Like her, I have visited the site and seen how the buildings are falling into greater decay on a daily basis.  Urgent intervention is required as the project, if it had proceeded in the way originally envisaged, could have been delivered on time for the centenary commemorations. I do not know what will happen now, but it could be a travesty.  I do not question the motivations of those on Dublin City Council who voted in the way they did, nor do I distrust those who want attention to be paid to the broader battlefield.  Will the funding necessary to achieve these objectives be obtained in a reasonable timeframe or are we risking further degradation of the site as a result?<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister for her work in the areas of the arts and education and what is stated in the report.  The Arts Charter is very positive.  It is very important that a person of the calibre of Professor John Coolahan is involved.  This signifies the importance of the arts in second level education.  Huge work has been done in promoting the arts in every primary school in the country, but things get a little ropey at second level owing to timing and so on.  More work needs to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Minister referred to the Arts Council, which is of enormous importance.  Its budget for this year is &euro;56.9 million.  A new chair and members of the Arts Council were recently appointed.  Those appointments followed an announcement by the then Minister, Deputy Deenihan, in March 2013 when he addressed the Royal Irish Academy that he would look at the boards of the cultural institutions.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has probably heard more than she wants to hear about the cultural institutions; she will forgive me for raising such a matter again.  The then Minister said he would reduce the membership of these boards and streamline them, with members serving on a <i>pro bono<\/i>basis.  An advertisement was subsequently placed for those boards, including the Arts Council.  Have things changed?  Are the members of the Arts Council being remunerated?  If they are being remunerated, who has approved their remuneration?  Is their remuneration in addition to expenses they are being paid, if they are being paid expenses?  If this has happened, was there any public announcement of the change of position by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, or is it something that has happened quietly behind the scenes?<br\/>The national media made reference recently to an allegation that a member of staff of the Arts Council had been involved in the payment of a grant to a family member.  I understand this is under investigation within the Arts Council.  Is the Minister aware of that?  It was certainly covered in the national media.  Will there be an external audit or investigation?  I would be very concerned about any State body, particularly a State body in receipt of &euro;56.9 million, having a member of staff who could be involved in the payment of a grant to an immediate family member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500013#O00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416930900,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael McCarthy resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930900,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Considerable work was put into the report Utilising the Arts to Combat Disadvantage.  It is in my Department now and we will work with the relevant stakeholders in that regard.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that local authority arts officers play a major role in making the arts more accessible to everyone.  They do a really good job.  Last Monday week I met them and the heritage officers.  It was very good to hear their views on the issues they had to raise.  That is a great role that we have with the local arts officers.<\/p><p>  I have constantly said that I want the 1916 centenary commemorations to be inclusive, respectful and appropriate.  Last Wednesday week we launched an overarching plan that will allow for consultation over the next three months.  I really want people to engage with this, because it is about the people.  We want people to visit our website, where they can log their interests and add their views.  I also want to hear the suggestions and views of members of this committee.  I very much want this to be inclusive.  The period of consultation is three months and I fully intend to engage with the Oireachtas group - Deputy Catherine Murphy is a member of that committee - and with the expert panel.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the video that was a backdrop on the night.  There have been some comments on it.  It was one of a number of displays on the evening of the launch.  It was part of a suite of materials, including the booklet, the outline programme and the information sheets on the capital projects, which were made available by the project team for the launch of the Ireland 2016 programme.  The material also supplemented official speeches delivered by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and me.  So it was only one part of a bigger package.<\/p><p>  I have said what I said about Moore Street.  My role is to protect the national monument as it is laid out now.  It was very disappointing, but I am happy to do what I can and work with whoever wants to try to progress this.  I was down there with the traders.  It would be very nice if this project could be ready for 2016.  If something is not done, the buildings will continue to fall into disrepair.  It would be a huge boost to the area if this project could be developed.  I saw the video, and the proposed layout, including an interpretive centre, is very impressive.  I hope something can be done to move this on.<\/p><p>  Members of the Arts Council are being remunerated because new members get the same as the old members.  If we want to change that, the legislation must change.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue regarding a member of staff and a grant payment.  The staff member was not involved in a payment situation.  The matter was fully investigated and addressed by the council.  The application in question was withdrawn.  There was no adverse finding and no resources were at issue in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500014#P00300","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930900,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will take a quick supplementary question, because I want to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500014#P00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930900,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I understand the positions on the Arts Council were advertised by the Minister's predecessor and were described as being <i>pro bono<\/i>positions.

The role of the Government is to encourage the arts and create an environment where artists can thrive.  If one connects the arts with the 1916 commemorations, which are about our strike for freedom, one can see that the arts are a very important and significant way to give value to that freedom.<\/p><p>  On the report mentioned by the Minister, I understand that perhaps there is some resistance to playing a role in combatting social disadvantage among some people operating in the arts and the powers that be.  However, it is important that the arts be involved, because they help us to look at things differently.  This is important not just for those who are socially disadvantaged, however we define that, but also for those who are not so disadvantaged, as it may affect how they relate to people in that situation.  We cannot underestimate the power of the arts in relation to racism, social disadvantage or whatever else.  It can turn many prejudices on their head, and we must use it as a tool.  The arts should be available to the general population because the value in the work of the artists and those who uphold the arts must be shared.  The money is taxpayers' money, so pressure must be applied to measure how those involved in the arts deliver on outreach to people who are not necessarily from an arts background, so that they get the benefit of it, while still supporting our artists and the art organisations.<\/p><p>  On the 1916 commemorations, it must be said from the outset, even as we tentatively discuss it here at the Minister's first meeting of this committee, that she will not win on this.  While we all enjoy the benefits of the freedom we have now, emanating from that point in our history, we also come from different traditions, ideologies and so on, so we must allow for that.  The Minister's approach is very conciliatory, drawing circles of inclusiveness around everybody, because no one group, viewpoint or ideology owns these commemorations.  As we move forward, we should reflect.  The events in question are now many generations back.  We cannot say we have the same perspective in our society as people had then, but we must be respectful.  The most important aspect of this is how we celebrate the hard-earned freedom we obtained after being under British rule for so long.  What have we done with this freedom?  What value has it been to our citizens?<\/p><p>  I will ask the Minister a question, which is the nub of what I want to talk about.  In my view, people in 1916 were fighting for freedom, so that we could engage in self-determination as individuals, as families and as a nation.  Have we now reached a point, especially during the Celtic Tiger, where a belief has been cultivated that the State will step into every gap?  The State cannot make up all the shortcomings in a person's life.  My concern is that I see not so much socialist ideals expressed through the democratic process, but a retrograde socialism that seeks to impair freedoms that we have won, such as we have seen in these water demonstrations and at Jobstown.  I am putting that out there, that in terms of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500015#Q00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1416931500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Could the Deputy ask a question so that we can move on?

I was not a Deputy at the time, but would the Minister agree that the centenary of 1913, for example, seemed to be virtually ignored by the State and the Government in terms of working-class history in this city?  Will the role of James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army, for example, or the international context of 1916 be featured?  The latter is very important in the sense that it was seen as an anti-war revolt as well.  Given what we have seen so far by the Government, as has been mentioned before, will big business be featured in these commemorations in a way it should not be?  For example, I did not know Google was in the GPO, but it seems it was if one looks at the first Government event held, which featured Google more than the Proclamation.<\/p><p>  There has been no change whatsoever in the arts budget, despite the Minister's statement that the arts are very important in Irish life.  She gave a quote about artists being the bedrock of our culture.  I was contacted by an artist in my own constituency who was not impressed that all of the &euro;4 million increase in funding was going to 1916.  I agree with him, because it is two years away.  Artists must work on a day-to-day basis.  He made the point that they do not have heating for their studios, they cannot afford materials for their work, and they are at the pin of their collars.  They had hoped this budget would signal an end to austerity for artists, but it does not.  That was in an e-mail directly from a working artist.  Everyone agrees with the artists' tax exemption, which allows people to work full-time as artists without being crippled with tax, but would the Minister not consider differentiating between the Bonos and the people on the ground?  It seems to apply across the board, even when people are multi-millionaires, and that comes across as ludicrous to any ordinary person.<\/p><p>  This being the first chance we have had to interview the Minister since she was appointed, it would be remiss not to say that her start was inauspicious in relation to the IMMA controversy.  She should acknowledge that people saw that as being extremely negative and that it seemed the Government was using cultural institutions as playthings.  I hope this signals the end of that.  In addition, the Minister mentioned that she was setting up something in Cavan-Monaghan, which I think is her own constituency.  Perhaps she can clarify that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500015#Q01400","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1416931500,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The arts officers will play a crucial role in the 2016 commemorations, particularly, as Deputy Mulherin said, to bring it outside Dublin.

I made the suggestion because we have two sets of Ministers and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht tends to be the poor relation, which should not be the case.  The attendance of so many people here today demonstrates that this area should get more attention than it does from this committee and others.<\/p><p>  The national cultural policy is very welcome.  It will have a local and a national dimension but I am concerned about where our cultural institutions will be by then because we already have a very serious problem.  The National Museum of Ireland is considering charging for the first time.  The National Library of Ireland said that only 1% of its collections can be conserved to best international practice.  There are 70,000 boxes of State records uncatalogued in the National Archives of Ireland and while they are not at risk, that is not the way the National Archives should function.<\/p><p>  I compliment the people who work in all three of those institutions who have been performing miracles for the funding with which they have been provided.  While it might be welcome that there has not been a funding cut, what is most unwelcome is that this is the Department that has sustained the greatest level of cuts over the years of austerity.  All of us should be very concerned about the national cultural institutions and while the local is vitally important in terms of our heritage, our national cultural institutions should have sufficient money to function.<\/p><p>  Regarding the decade of centenaries, I am on the consultative committee where there is a great focus, and rightly so, on the centrepiece that is the commemoration of 1916 in 2016.  There will probably be opportunities to do a great deal outside the capital with regard to other elements of that decade of centenaries.  The centrepiece will be Dublin and while there are some welcome developments with regard to the pension records, Kilmainham Gaol, the GPO and so on, it is not clear if there will be sufficient time for the consultative process and then to plan events, given the tight timeframe.  The Minister might indicate when that consultative process will be completed.  In terms of the submissions that are made, what timeline are people working to?  It will be very difficult for people not knowing if money will be available or if they will have sufficient time to organise events.  It has been left very late.<\/p><p>  I stated at the consultation committee that we need to have a wide vision around this decade of centenaries.  We have not had that big visionary moment not just in terms of looking at the short-term in a pragmatic way, but the longer-term outcome and how the arts can play a role in that.  For example, I felt envious of the debate that took place in Scotland on the referendum on independence.  We need to have that vision in terms of the kind of country we want to create.  The people who took to the streets in 1916, including some of my ancestors, had that vision.  They wanted something better.  If there is a Department that can articulate that, it has to be the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht because it is the Department that should be able to capture the soul of the country.  That is why we should be concerned about our national cultural institutions.  This is the time they should be funded and resourced because people are paying attention.  I am seriously concerned that the view is that we just have to get it over with rather than embrace it, so to speak.<\/p> <p>Some very good work was done on <i>genealogy.ie<\/i>.  The indexes for the general register were put up on the website, but they have been taken down and not reappeared.  It is very unfortunate, but we need to know when it will happen.

She and I have exchanged ideas in the Seanad in the last while.  I will repeat some but not all of them.<\/p><p>  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Joe McHugh, chomh maith.  Is iontach an comhartha &eacute; de athnuachan a chuid Gaeilge go bhfuil s&eacute; in ann &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh agus molaim go m&oacute;r &eacute; as ucht an dul chuige at&aacute; aige &oacute; thaobh sin.<\/p><p>  I have five simple questions and will keep my contribution short.  I support absolutely Deputy Catherine Murphy in her concern about the national cultural institutions.  For the record and the purposes of dealing with conflict of interest issues, I am the director of a national cultural institution - the Abbey Theatre.  Notwithstanding this, the sword of Damocles has been hanging over the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland and it is of deep concern to all of us that support is given to them.  On that basis and without adding additional questions to Deputy Catherine Murphy's, I note my question on the centenary.<\/p><p>  I note that the 1916 Rising was the culmination of a cultural revolution that had started at the end of the 19th century.  Any sidelining of contemporary art and artists would hollow out the impact of the commemoration in 2016.  I would like to hear what role the Minister considers artists will have in the commemoration and what role the Arts Council will have.  The &euro;4 million about which we are talking is clearly not enough.  It should really have gone to the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland to physically stay open.  How can we plan and what is the central role of artists?  As I noted in the Seanad, there is great relief the Minister has announced the centenaries as it appeared there was paralysis.  We can now get involved in disagreements.  Disagreement is good.  Disagreeing about the memories of 1916 is good and how artists interpret history and the future is important.  The centrality of contemporary artists is important, but I have not heard enough from the Minister on this issue.  Is she consulting the Arts Council on it?<\/p><p>  My second question is based on the second recommendation in the committee's report which was published in June this year.  It was also a significant recommendation at the Global Irish Economic Forum at Dublin Castle in October 2013.  I refer to research and data.  I do not expect the Minister to have an answer, but I would like her or her officials to come back to us on the role of data and research and how we can collate them.  All I ask for is a promise to come back to the committee with a response.  The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North has a full-time economist working on data, the funding of the arts, the impact of the arts and how research can support not only new language but also new arguments that move away from those on economics, jobs, tourism and bed nights to permit growing self-confidence around supporting and increasing the arts.  I want the Minister's commitment that she will come back within a reasonable time with a response from her officials on recommendation No. 2 in the report.<\/p><p>  My third question relates to the Minister's commitment to look at the National Concert Hall Bill.  The committee is reporting back to her on that issue.  Does she have any other legislation planned for introduction during her term of office that relates to national cultural institutions?<\/p><p>  I turn to my fourth question.  I commend and wholeheartedly support Culture 2025.  Is there anything the committee can do to help?  I note that the Minister will be issuing a paper in the new year for public consultation and urge her to ensure artists will be central to it, not administrators, politicians or even me.  Artists should be included in the middle to drive it and support the Minister in articulating a future vision for 2025.  I would like a commitment from her in that regard.<\/p><p>  My final question relates to my support for the tax exemption for artists.  The issue is that the majority of artists earn less than the average industrial wage.  A cap of &euro;50,000 in one year would actually help the millionaires but not young artists who might receive an advance for a novel or a major public art commission in one year.  That a young artist might receive &euro;50,000 may seem like a lot, but when one spreads it over three years, it becomes ridiculous.  I am concerned that the Department of Finance is looking at reviewing the tax relief in 2015 with \"abolition on the table\".  What has the Minister done in the background?  How can we help her to retain the exemption in 2015?  While it absolutely needs reform, as Deputy Ruth Coppinger said, we support artists who are on the bread line and the poverty line.  We should positively discriminate in favour of artists and it may be that even a figure of &euro;100,000 is not so considerable when aggregated over three to four years.  This is not about tax avoidance but about encouraging artists to keep at their work and retain their dignity and integrity.  The cap should be based on an aggregate figure as opposed to a single year.  I know artists who received &euro;50,000 for a particular project but who had no other earnings in the next couple of years.  Of course, they are going to pay tax on it.  <\/p><p>  Those are my five questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500017#S00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1416932700,"counter":265,"content":"<p>If I miss a question, I ask members to come back to me.  <\/p><p>  I will start with the artists' exemption.  It was good news to have it increased this year from &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000.  I accept fully what Senator Fiach Mac Conghail is saying about its aggregation over a five year term, given the drop in the incomes of artists.  I agree with him and we will take up the matter with the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>  I was asked about the role of the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions in the 2016 programme.  We have proposals from the Arts Council and all of the cultural institutions and are going to move on them.  We very much want them to be involved.  The arts bring another dimension to the programme and it is important to use them to look forward also.  They can cross boundaries that the spoken word cannot and they should be very much involved in the 2016 commemorations.  That is why I took the opportunity when I was meeting arts officers separately on their own issues to say I wanted to discuss the 2016 commemorations with them to see how they could become involved.  Artists and the arts will play a significant role in 2016.<\/p><p>  Cultural capital was mentioned.  I was in New Orleans only a few weeks ago when I saw how greatly the people there valued their culture and the arts.  This has a hugely positive effect on the economy there.  I met the mayor who gave us a document on how they valued the arts and how they translated into economic activity in the city.  Investment in the arts has made a huge difference and brought long-term benefits, a point on which I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p><p>  I was asked about legislation.  The draft heads of two Bills are with the committee on the museum and galleries.  The National Concert Hall Bill is my priority.  The other two are at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500017#S00300","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1416932700,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We will expect the Minister to return to us on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500017#S00400","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1416933300,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Yes, we are waiting for the pre-legislative scrutiny process to conclude.<\/p><p>  To respond to Deputy Catherine Murphy, the National Archives storage is being developed in the next five years.

As I stated, this year, for the first time in six years, their funding has not been cut.  I accept, however, that this may not be great comfort to them.  I want to work with them.  Having met all of the chairpersons, I am aware of their concerns.  My Department continues to engage with them and we are doing everything possible to help them.  As the economy improves, there is no doubt that they will receive increased funding. <\/p><p>  I was asked about the consultation process for the 2016 commemorations.

While it is one thing to have a capital project, specialist personnel are also needed in the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives and the National Museum of Ireland.

A number of cities are bidding to be the European capital of culture 2020, including my own.  When will this process begin?<\/p><p>  In her opening remarks, the Minister outlined very well the position with regard to Moore Street.  In July this year the relatives of the 1916 leaders released a statement that they were very supportive of the Government's decision to proceed with the preservation of the four buildings.  Has their view on this changed?  Are they in support of the urban battlefield idea?  If this is the case, I presume there is no funding for it because it would involve the preservation of the alleyways and the entire area on Moore Street.  The original idea was to be financed by NAMA.  I have much sympathy for the Minister, as she has worked quite hard behind the scenes on resolving the issue, but it looks like it is now an issue for Dublin City Council to resolve, although I know the Minister will do whatever she can informally behind the scenes.  She outlined the fact she has no statutory function in this regard.  It would be a shame to see a project such as this not come to fruition when one sees the plans put in place with regard to the historic trail from the GPO to Kilmainham courthouse and jail.

I had a chance to discuss it with the officials prior to the meeting.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a contract with Mr. Maurice Coughlan for the period from 1 December 2011 to 30 November 2014 for the provision of a passenger ferry service between Long Island in Cork and the mainland.  As the contract was coming to an end, the Department sought tenders for a new contract through a public tendering process, advertised in the normal way on eTenders.  The term of the new contract was to be from 1 December 2014 to 30 November 2019, ministerial approval having been granted for the new contract to cover a five-year period rather than a three-year period, as is currently the case.<\/p><p>  The deadline for receipt of tenders was 15 August 2014.  After that date a tender assessment committee was established to assess the tenders.  Having worked through the assessment process it was the committee&rsquo;s view that there were issues within the tenders received.  The committee sought the advice of the Department&rsquo;s evaluation unit, the Office of Government Procurement and the Chief State&rsquo;s Solicitor&rsquo;s Office on the most appropriate course of action.  The legal advice was the tendering process should be terminated and that a new tender competition should be advertised.  To achieve a solution, the Department was left with no choice but to extend the current contract for a period.  Ministerial approval was obtained to extend the current contract for four months up until 31 March 2015.  The Department advertised for tenders for a five-year contract to commence on 1 April 2015.  That is not unprecedented.  As the procurement process for the contract is under way, and based on legal advice, it would not be appropriate to give any details regarding issues relating to the previous tenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500020#X00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1416934500,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Both of the tender providers tendered for the contract previously and were awarded it.

Many of the items which she mentioned tend to interact.  It is interesting how most of them tend to refer back to the 1916 commemoration, and that is as it should be.  If we are talking about culture, art and the Irish language, they were all particular elements relating to the 1916 Rising.<\/p><p>  We should all work towards creating as much unity as possible in regard to this commemoration.  There are some misunderstandings in the public domain which can be addressed in a simple and straightforward manner.  Some of these come, perhaps, from the vacuum which was created because the programme had not been brought forward, although this is not anyone's fault.  I believe that there is a growing interest among the public in this commemoration, for all kinds of reasons.  First, it led us towards our independence, and second, it is because of the number of relatives whose ancestors fought in 1916.  There is always that community aspect of any commemoration which could very well be the bedrock of a very successful commemoration.  We should work towards as much unity as possible.  That does not mean we have to be uniform.  As mentioned at this meeting, many people have different ideas and perhaps different experiences of and relationships with 1916.  All of those can be accommodated without any great degree of difficulty.<\/p><p>  It is a pity that the question of the presence of a royal personage at the 1916 commemoration was put forward at such an early date.  We had an even worse scenario, if I might use that word, which was the idea that we were going to have a company of the British Army marching down O'Connell Street.  That gained a certain level of credence as well.  To some extent that has distracted from the building of a real commemoration, much of which has been sidelined at the moment.  It was also a pity that the historians got involved at too late a date or so late, because they could have played a very significant role in the debate.  I refer to Diarmaid Ferriter's contribution in this regard.  What is important is that, whatever misunderstandings have arisen, these should be laid aside because the one thing we do not want is to debase this commemoration through disunity and disharmony.  We have to do something about that.<\/p><p>  I put forward the notion of a people's commemoration in a broader sense.  Another group refers to a citizens' commemoration but I think a people's commemoration will happen anyway.  There will not be an area in Ireland where there is not some activity which will reflect that community's interaction with the commemoration.  This interaction and activity will be very strong.  The people's commemoration should not be rewrapped in some way that it is intended as opposition to the State commemoration.  This should be a partnership along every yard of the way and I think this will happen anyway.<\/p><p>  On the Moore Street issue, I am disappointed at the situation.  Many people invested much time in this concept and project over a number of years.  We are at a stage where instead of being able to say we are making progress, we have people taking opposing positions.  I urge the Minister, arising out of her own comments but I have made this point at previous meetings of the this committee, that there should be a round-table private discussion with the city council, the Department and the families.  I do not have any doubt that it would work.<\/p><p>  I suggest the solution would be along the lines that we would go along with the Minister's proposal for Moore Street but that the idea of the battle site could be considered at a future date and in other circumstances.  We have to accept that it is regarded as one of the most important battle sites in Europe.  The National Museum of Ireland has made this point.  We should not become bogged down as to whether it is the whole battle site or the buildings.  There is great potential in what the Minister has said about the plans for the buildings.  However, if the other issue is not put to bed, it will be a distraction from the buildings.  I am confident that a solution can be found with the city council, the Department and the families involved.  I have a had lot of connection with them over recent years.  I introduced them to a former Taoiseach who met them.  I know that whatever is happening here and the friction which is developing is not a friction that can be laid aside.  I urge the Minister, even though it might seem like a difficult task, and I do not mean in saying this that there should be cameras or newspapers present, to have a private discussion with representatives of the city council and everybody else in order that there can be a full understanding of what is on offer.  I do not think there is yet a full understanding of what is on offer.  The concerns of those who want to go further can certainly be laid to rest by the idea of moving forward at a further stage.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a point on the Irish language.  The committee had a meeting today with the language commissioner from Wales, Meri Huws.  We had a very good meeting with her.  We went to Wales five or six weeks ago and we met the First Minister, with the Arts Council, with the Eisteddfod and with the commissioner.  We had a very prolonged two days of work.  What struck me very forcefully was the similarities between Wales and Ireland.  In fact, it was said to us that their language Act is based on our language Act to a large degree.<\/p> <p>Today, the commissioner offered to meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to chat with him about her views.  There is a global body of ten language commissioners whose meetings she attends, so she would not only be dealing with the Welsh experience, but also with that of the other commissioners.  It would be very worthwhile to take her up on that offer.  The new language Bill must bring on board all those who have supported its previous incarnation, which was unanimous in the Oireachtas - as was the 20-year strategy - and interestingly brought all the language organisations with it.  The Minister knows as well as I do that I have only ever had the objective of keeping politics out of the language.  It belongs to no political party.  It belongs to the people and is central to the 1916 commemoration.  I am slightly afraid that if we do not keep the goodwill that is there, the political divisiveness which I have not seen in almost 20 years may come back again.  I ask that the Minister consider this in the interest of broadening the debate on the Language Bill.<\/p><p> I fully support the charter for the arts, which I think is a wonderful idea.  My own organisation, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, is very deeply involved.  We are interacting with the schools as was intended in the charter and have now introduced our latest initiative, TradTime, into 100 schools.  We are providing the backup teachers and so on and the initiative is being expanded.  The Minister for Education is to meet me to see how we can develop it further.  There is a waiting list for schools wanting to come in.  It is exceptionally successful and is tax compliant.  It has all the elements the Minister of State requires and I was glad to hear him mention it today.  It is something we could build on in a big way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014112500021#Y00600","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416935700,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I support what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has said regarding Moore Street.  We need to find a resolution.  If everybody is around the table and they stay there until they solve it, I have no doubt they will do so.  Between now and 2016, it would also be a good idea to develop a trail of all the 1916 sites around Dublin and around the country.  County Kerry is involved because of Roger Casement, County Galway because of Liam Mellows, and so are County Wexford, County Laois and many other places.  It would be a good idea to develop a trail, for Irish people and people from abroad, so that all of the sites could be brought together.  In the case of Dublin, I am envisioning a walking trail, a green line down the streets leading to all the sites.<\/p><p>  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;or-t&aacute;bhachtach a thuiscint nach mbeadh an m&eacute;id a tharla i 1916 murach an teanga.

Bheinn ag si&uacute;l mar chuid de chom&oacute;radh 1916 go gcuirfear an t-airgead breise -  caipitil agus reatha - a theasta&iacute;onn &oacute;n &Uacute;dar&aacute;s ar f&aacute;il.  <\/p><p>  Is d&oacute;igh liom, thar aon rud eile &oacute; thaobh 1916, agus le h&oacute;m&oacute;s a thaispe&aacute;int do chinnir&iacute; 1916, gurb &eacute; an rud is m&oacute; go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm go hioml&aacute;n.  Cloisim an rud seo:  \"De r&eacute;ir mar a bheidh acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il\".  Beidh acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il amach anseo ach b'fh&eacute;idir nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga baile l&aacute;idir a thuilleadh san Ghaeltacht.  D&aacute; gcuirf&iacute; &euro;3 milli&uacute;n n&oacute; &euro;4 milli&uacute;n breise ar f&aacute;il as caiteachas an Rialtais, b'&eacute; an rud c&eacute;anna le teaghlach le ioncam de &euro;50,000 ag cur &euro;3 ar f&aacute;il do rud &eacute;icint.

Is ionann &euro;3 breise do theaghlach le &euro;50,000 do chaiteachas agus &euro;3 milli&uacute;n &oacute; thaobh an St&aacute;it.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liomsa go bhfuil leithsc&eacute;al ar bith ann agus muid ag d&eacute;anamh com&oacute;radh ar 1916 a bheith ag caint ar acmhainn&iacute; a bheith mar fhadhb.  Ba mhaith liom ceist an-d&iacute;reach a chur ar an Aire St&aacute;it.  An lag&uacute; n&oacute; l&aacute;idri&uacute; a bheidh i gceist leis na leasuithe ar an Acht teanga?<\/p><p>  My view is that the Proclamation should be at the centre of the 1916 commemorations.  It mentions \"Irishmen and Irishwomen\" three times.  It specifically mentions the \"happiness and prosperity of the whole nation\" and an Irish Government \"elected by the suffrages of all her men and women\".  It is a very democratic document.  The argument they had, of course, was that the Irish men and women were not getting the choice of picking their own form of government.  The most misquoted phrase in the Proclamation is about \"cherishing all the children of the nation equally\", \"oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past\".  This is specifically alluding to reconciliation within this island between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions.  There is nothing in that Proclamation that needs to be discarded, which is extraordinary given the events of the past 100 years.  It actually says it all, and therefore our challenge is not the Proclamation - in my view, that can stay at the centre - but the implementation of the Proclamation.  Any commemoration that does not have it as the central theme is not being true to 1916.<\/p><p>  Would it be possible for the Minister of State to suggest to his colleague in the Department of Education that the 1916 Easter Week Commemoration Scholarship be reinstated forthwith?  I cannot for the life of me understand c&eacute;n fath gur cuireadh deireadh le scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; 1916 ach s&iacute;lim go mba cheart go gcuirf&iacute; ar ais iad.

This is Bord F&aacute;ilte spending State money and, in such cases, an agency should have the choice of something that is a keystone in the commemoration programme.  Therefore, we need a simple statement by the Government that full funding will be provided, that an agency, whether &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or Bord F&aacute;ilte, will be given the money, and that it will be ring-fenced for Teach an Phiarsaigh.  Once and for all, this should finish the uncertainty about the funding of the project.<\/p><p> Finally, I noticed today that there has been very little discussion about hen harriers and bog cutters.  The total non-acceptance by rural people of EU regulations on habitats is a major challenge.  One farmer in Connemara put it graphically when people were talking about the GLAS scheme.  He said that Cromwell sent people to Connacht but at least he did not put any conditions on it.  That says it all.  Most rural people feel that the way the habitats directive is implemented, from Europe and in this country, inhibits people from becoming landowners and willing partners in conservation.  Without the willing partnership, we will not get the desired conservation.  We must think this out again and come up with a system whereby people are recognised as custodians of the national heritage.  The Minister has a role to play, along with her colleague in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The Bill as published brings within its scope consultant lobbyists acting on behalf of a client, employers with more than ten employees and individuals with regard to development and zoning matters, that is, anyone lobbying in connection with a development or zoning matter.  Amendment No. 6 aims to ensure that relevant communication by representative and advocacy bodies, that is those established to further a particular issue, will come within the definition of lobbying where the organisation has at least one employee.  The proposed amendment will make it clear, therefore, that the exemption from registration for employers of up to ten employees will not apply to employers who are either representative or advocacy bodies.  Concerns were expressed by some of the stakeholders we talked to during the very long consultative process, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Farmers Association, that while some representative bodies can have small numbers of staff, they can actually have a very substantial membership base.  The amendment concerning advocacy bodies will allow bodies such as Transparency International Ireland to come within the scope of the Bill and is in line with the transparency objectives of the Bill.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 6 also clarifies that the reference to employees is full-time employees.  Amendment No. 24 deletes section 5(3)(b) as this provision is now incorporated into the revised subsection (1) of section 5.  I note that the next amendment from Deputy McDonald, amendment No. 24, and amendment No. 25 proposed by Deputy Fleming propose changes to section 5(3)(b) and will both, therefore, fall, if my amendment is passed, as the Chairman has already indicated.  The proposed amendment No. 52 in section 7 is necessary consequent to the amendment of section 5(1) so that a definition of full-time employee is included in the Bill.  The term full-time employee is defined by reference to section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act of 2001.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 24 proposes an amendment to section 5, which will mean the deletion of section 5(3)(b), as also proposed by Deputy McDonald.  I am proposing these amendments to ensure that relevant communication by representative and advocacy bodies, that is, those established to further a particular issue, will come within the definition of lobbying regardless of the number of employees they have.  That was a point raised by a number of Deputies at Second Stage.  The proposed amendments will make it clear that the exemption for employers of up to ten employees will not apply to representative or advocacy bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500003#B03000","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416926400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>We have quite a list of amendments in this group.

The essence of this line of discussion is to deal with the meaning of carrying on lobbying activities, as the name of section 5 indicates.  The Minister has just referred to a number of amendments he proposes to make to the section but I have a number of concerns about this Bill and this issue is probably the one of most concern.  I have tabled approximately 15 amendments on this area.  I believe that while the legislation is both good and necessary, it is not going far enough.  It does not cover aspects of lobbying that I believe should be included under the definition of \"carrying on lobbying activities\".  As I said on Second Stage, the inclusion or exclusion of some of these issues will be the acid test for this legislation.  Many issues have been mentioned in recent times with regard to lobbying and it is important that we take note of the current debate.<\/p><p>  The types of lobbying referred to in my amendments Nos. 7 to 21 are specific and in many cases refer to Government monopolies which are not already included in the legislation.  Some of them would be commercial in nature but others are monopolies.  From that point of view, the issue of competition or an adverse impact on their financial situation does not arise.  The issue of lobbying regulators is also very important because regulators can have a major influence on many activities carried out by public bodies and they need to be included or captured by this legislation.  <\/p><p>  I will start with amendment No. 7, which proposes to include under the meaning of carrying on lobbying activities, a person or body which \"makes, manages or directs the making of any relevant communications to any member of Government in relation to appointments to State Boards\".  What we saw with the recent controversy over the appointment of Mr. John McNulty to a State board so that he would be eligible to run for the Seanad by-election was unedifying, to say the least.  I am not referring here to the character of the individual involved, who I do not know.  What transpired there was, to use the old-fashioned phrase, \"stroke politics\".  The Minister would accept that and he knows that something needs to be done in the area of appointments to State boards.  It is all well and good to passing legislation relating to lobbyists but if the mechanisms by which people are appointed to State boards cannot be captured in the legislation, then the legislation is very weak.  I will judge this legislation not just on its individual sections, many of which are very good, but also on whether items that should be included are excluded.  I do not want to have fig-leaf legislation, with people saying that it is great that we now have registration of lobbyists legislation, indicative of political reform, but when one examines the legislation one finds that some of the key activities that one would expect to be covered by it are excluded.  When legislation is brought forward it should not be piecemeal but comprehensive.  There is nothing more necessary to include in this legislation than the lobbying of members of Government concerning appointments to State boards.  <\/p><p>  The Minister issued a press release some time ago indicating that he will issue guidelines to Ministers, will consult widely on the matter and that the Public Appointments Service would be involved.  He referred to gender balance on State boards and so forth, all of which is very good.  However, none of it is being underpinned by legislation or regulation.  All we have is a press release about guidelines and requests to Ministers, who may or may not have to follow those guidelines.  Indeed, it will be quite some time before those very guidelines are finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500004#C00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>They were published this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500004#C00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The guidelines were published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500004#C00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500004#C00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416926400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I will be introducing legislation in the D&aacute;il tomorrow dealing with appointments to State boards.

My legislation has been drafted and is in the system.  I think the Ceann Comhairle has it listed for tomorrow.  It may be listed for another day but that is beyond my control now, to some extent.  I would hope that the guidelines will substantially dove tail with what is in my draft legislation.  If that is the case, then all I will ask the Minister to do is take one further step and put the guidelines on appointments to State boards on a statutory footing rather than leaving matters the way they are, whereby it is left up to Ministers to adhere to the guidelines.  We can talk about that further.   Having discussed this legislation on Second Stage, I felt that there was a big lacuna that needed to be addressed because this Bill does not deal with appointments to State boards.<\/p> <p>That is why I tabled amendment No. 7.<br\/>The Minister has stated that, in the context of communications with members of the Government regarding appointments to State boards, he is publishing guidelines today.  That is a very welcome development.  I hope that what he proposes can be placed on a legislative footing.  Amendment No. 7 is the acid test and it is fundamental that the provision it contains be included in the Bill.  If it is not, the Bill is will fail the test of public opinion.  Members of the Oireachtas have their own views with regard to what is and is not necessary but members of the public have their own opinions.  We must take on board the views of members of the public and I believe they would like to see the introduction of legislation relating to appointments to State boards.  An essential part of such legislation would be provisions relating to communications with Government Ministers.  I am of the view that legislation in this regard will be forthcoming in due course and I hope the Minister will agree to take that step tomorrow.<br\/>Amendment No. 8 suggests the insertion into the Bill of the phrase &quot;lobbies a consultant employed to carry out work for or on behalf of a public body or Government Department&quot;.  This is also an extremely important amendment, particularly as everything seems to be outsourced at present.  Different Departments may engage consultants to carry out work in respect of taxation proposals, public expenditure proposals, shared services and many other issues.  If one lobbies the consultant employed to perform a particular task, it can sometimes prove far more effective than lobbying a Government official or a Minister.  By the time a matter reaches the relevant official or Minister, a body of documentation will have been produced and if it is any way correct it might carry through the system to a conclusion.  There is a very big gap in this area in the context of the consultants carrying out work such as that to which I refer.  There was a time when this work would have been done by public servants and such a scenario would be captured under the legislation.  Now, however, public bodies can outsource work to consultants and this means it is not being done by their staff.  As a result, the matter falls outside the scope of the legislation.  Lobbying consultants employed by public bodies to carry out work on their behalf should&quot; be contemplated under the Bill.<br\/>In amendment No. 9 I am seeking to have included in the Bill the phrase &quot;lobbies Irish Rail and such person shall be required to be a registered person pursuant to <i>section 8<\/i>&quot;.  Irish Rail is a State monopoly.  The Minister and I share the view that semi-State companies which are competing commercially should not be placed at a disadvantage in the context of the companies in the private sector against which they are competing.  Irish Rail is not in competition with anyone because it is the only rail company in the country.  It is a State monopoly and it could be lobbied in respect of matters as diverse as the purchase of trains, equipment, contracts, maintenance, services, health and safety, new routes or the deletion of routes or timetables.  As a result, it is important that Irish Rail be included under the legislation.<br\/>I am seeking, by means of amendment No. 10, to include in the Bill the phrase &quot;lobbies Irish Water and such person shall be required to be a registered person pursuant to <i>section 8<\/i>&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500004#C01200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416927000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>God help us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500005#D00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416927000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>God help us is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500005#D00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416927000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>A lot of people are going to be obliged to register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500005#D00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416927000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Some time ago, the Minister refused to allow Irish Water to be included under the freedom of information legislation.  Subsequently, he was obliged to have it included.  He also refused to have it included under the legislation relating to the Ombudsman and I believe he has also been obliged to row back in that regard.

I have made my point and I will move on.<br\/>Amendment No. 11 is designed to obliged those who register An Post to be registered.  Again, An Post is a commercial semi-State body and it has a monopoly in the context of the delivery of post to houses.  I accept, however, that its parcel delivery and other divisions are obliged to compete with many private contractors.  Where State monopolies are being lobbied, people are entitled to know who is doing the lobbying.<br\/>Amendment No. 12 relates to Eirgrid.  People who lobby Eirgrid should also be contemplated under the legislation, particularly as that entity can have a fundamental influence on people's lives.  I accept that it is not a commercial semi-State body and is more along the lines of a regulator or whatever.  I also accept that it might be involved in some commercial activity but the majority of what it does in the context of planning new routes is a matter of public interest.  People need to know who is lobbying in respect of such matters.<br\/>I am seeking in amendment No. 13 to have those who lobby the Commission for Energy Regulation included under the legislation.  The role of that office has been devalued to such an extent that I do not know whether the Government is aware of its existence.  We are informed that the regulator approves certain matters relating to Irish Water but it is the Government that makes the decisions.  In the context of whatever limited role the Commission for Energy Regulation has been left with, the public needs to be informed about those who lobby it.<br\/>The position is the same with regard to the National Transport Authority, to which amendment No. 14 relates.  The authority, which is not a commercial semi-State body, is responsible - among other things - for licensing public bus passenger services and its work in this regard relates to both Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators.  There has been some discussion with regard to the privatisation of 10% of bus routes in Dublin and the National Transport Authority will be lobbied extensively in respect of that matter.  The people who lobby it in respect of issues of this nature should be included under the legislation.<br\/>Amendment No. 15 relates to people who lobby the Private Security Authority, while amendment No. 16 relates to those who lobby Tourism Ireland.  People who lobby Tourism Ireland should be required to be registered.  In that context, it might make far more sense for someone who believes there is a case to establish a tourism product in an area in which he or she is commercially involved to lobby officials from Tourism Ireland than lobbying the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or some other Government Minister.  Again, Tourism Ireland is similar to a regulator to some extent and it has a great deal of influence.<br\/>Amendment No. 17 relates to those who seek to lobby Waterways Ireland.  In the event that I have missed out on naming any entities, amendment No. 18 seeks to have included in the Bill the phrase &quot;lobbies bodies, whose funding is made up of in excess of 50 per cent of voted expenditure, and such person shall be required to be a registered person pursuant to <i>section 8<\/i>&quot;.  It goes without saying that I am referring here to bodies such as the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, and Rehab, which receive over 50% of their income through specific voted expenditure provided by the HSE, the Department of Health, etc.  There have been many difficulties with regard to such bodies being made accountable to the Houses.  The Minister and members are aware that representatives from Rehab came before the Committee of Public Accounts and I understand that the matter relating to it is due to go before the courts.  That is in respect of an accountability issue.  Members of the public will accept that if an organisation is receiving more than 50% of its funding from voted expenditure provided by the Government, then those who want to lobby it should be contemplated under the legislation.<br\/>Amendment No. 19 relates to people who lobby the HSE, while amendment No. 20 relates to the those who lobby the Central Bank.  When the Central Bank comes up with an idea to amend the relevant rules to such an extent that people's ability to obtain mortgages is going to be fundamentally impacted upon, the public is entitled to know who lobbied and exerted pressure on it.  I refer here to lobbyists both in Ireland and elsewhere.  Pressure can be put on organisations such as the Central Bank from outside the country.  Certain aspects of the bank's activities are subject to confidentiality under the rules of the European Central Bank and I am not proposing that this should be changed.<br\/>Amendment No. 21 relates to those who lobby the education and training boards, which replaced the vocational education committees.  Again, almost 100% of the money relating to these boards comes from the taxpayer.  In my view, the public is entitled to know who might be lobbying the people who serve on these boards.<br\/>The next amendments in my name are Nos. 25 and 26.<\/p> <p>I will speak on those, and the Deputy who has other amendments in this group can then speak on them. \u00a0Amendment No. 25 relates to the issue of employers, to which the Minister has referred. \u00a0It proposes the inclusion in that paragraph of other registered persons as well as an employer. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500005#D00900","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416927600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>My only amendment in this grouping is amendment No. 24. \u00a0The Minister has echoed the principle of this amendment. \u00a0Why is there a threshold of ten employees? \u00a0I imagine he has an eye on avoiding anything that is overly onerous on smaller businesses, and I appreciate that. \u00a0That is legitimate, but given that we are no longer living in an era of tablets of stone and the use of quills and ink and that we have IT systems and so on, I do not imagine the registration procedure should be so onerous that we need to be sensitive to employee numbers. \u00a0The Minister and I have tabled an amendment with the same principle, but the threshold of ten employees still features in the legislation. \u00a0Will the Minister indicate the rationale for that?

All I have learned from other countries that have tried to do it is that they need to tweak it and change it to suit their own domestic circumstances. \u00a0I will deal with the Deputies' specific amendments.  I will be broadening the scope of this mechanism once we have an annual review of it in a year's time to see how we can broaden the definitions, including the definition of the lobbied, and to see how the lobbyists are captured and whether there is anybody who needs to be captured in a better way. \u00a0I totally disagree with the notion that is some sort of fig leaf, which I know is good for a sound bite. \u00a0This is the most honest attempt I can make. \u00a0A very hard-working team of people have been involved in this from a public discussion forum that invited submissions on the holding a seminar for all interested bodies. \u00a0Some people were frightened that they would be excluded from expressing a legitimate point of view or that there would be a disincentive for them to argue their case with the Government, but the reverse is the case: we we want to encourage and facilitate lobbying in a transparent and open way and not have any impediment to that. \u00a0Getting that balance is what I have tried to do in this Bill.<br\/><br\/>  To deal with some specific points, on amendment No. 7 relating to the role of Ministers in terms of State boards, the Government this morning approved the guidelines, after considerable consultation, on the appointment of State boards. \u00a0They are quite ground-breaking. \u00a0They will bring about a sea change in the way public appointments are made. \u00a0I will not enter into cheap politics and say that it has been ever thus. \u00a0If one looks through the list of people who have been appointed by all parties represented here, including Deputy McDonald's when account is taken of the North-South bodies in terms of political affiliation, it is only natural that we appoint people who we know can do the job as opposed to taking a chance on people who on paper may have a great CV but whose ability to do the job, in practical terms, we do not know. \u00a0Having the robust, independent mechanism that we have now established will be one of the most important things we have done as a Government in terms of the reform agenda that I want to see in place. \u00a0As to whether it will it be the be all and end all, no, it will not.  It will revisited again and there will be a review of it in a year's time. \u00a0I cannot remember if a year or 18 months was the timescale we settled on for a review of the State boards appointments mechanism. \u00a0I had a long discussion with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, on this, and I know it is up to the job.<br\/><br\/>  I want to say something more profound to Deputy Fleming. \u00a0I want everybody who is interested to apply. \u00a0I do not want anybody who would come up to me and say he or she would be a great person to do the job to be in any way inhibited in doing that. \u00a0I would tell them to go through the PAS system, because that is the new system. \u00a0This it is the only route to a State board appointment, having regard to the legislation that governs some bodies, including the North-South bodies, and it will be by a formal Government decision. \u00a0With regard to people who express a view to a Minister, to the Deputy as an opposition Member, or to anybody, that they would love to serve on a board and have a great set of skills or that they have retired from their jobs and want to serve in some way, I do not accept that one cannot tell them to look up <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>and check the criteria for each of the State boards. \u00a0I would welcome that sort of lobbying. \u00a0It is a significant break from what has happened in the past and, for that reason, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>  Amendment No. 8 deals with the designation of the lobbied. \u00a0I would point out that under section 1(g), categories of persons other than public servants can be designated as the lobbied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500006#E00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416927600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>What section is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500006#E00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416927600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Section 1(g).  Apologies; it is section 6(1)(g).<\/p> <p>Section 6(1)(g) allows the definition of the lobbied to be extended, which I intend to do that but, again, on the basis of experience.  The first iteration of this will be secretaries general of the Departments, assistant secretaries general, principal officers, chief executive officers of local authorities, chief executives of companies and so on.  Others will be included later.<\/p><p> I will address the issue relating to local authorities when we come to deal with an amendment on that issue in the name of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  As I said, the list is not fixed.  We need to first bed down the system and explain to people what is expected of them.  If people are going to be in breach of the law we had better give them a chance to understand what exactly is expected of them in this regard.  I want to do this in a way that does not bring the whole system into disrepute before it starts.  <\/p><p> In regard to many other categories which Deputies are seeking by way of a number of amendments to have included, some, like the Central Bank, cannot be included because as Deputies will be aware it is part of the Eurogroup system and we would require the authority of the European Central Bank to do this.  In regard to the others, there are real practical difficulties.  Let us bed down the first tranche of people, who are the real power brokers in the land, including Ministers and staff of the Departments and so on.  I will provide Deputies with a comprehensive list of the first people to be captured by this measure.  <\/p><p> Under section 6, we will over time migrate it to other categories.  I do not expect Deputy Fleming's list is an exhaustive list.  There will be others we want to include in this over time.  This legislation is ground breaking a new space.  It was regarded as a model Bill by the open government partnership.  It is not a finished a product, no more than, say, the Freedom of Information or the protected disclosures legislation.  When this Bill becomes an Act of the Oireachtas it will not be the final word on this issue.  All the issues covered by it will have to be refined to address new circumstances.  <\/p><p> Deputy McDonald asked the reason the threshold is set at ten full-time employees.  There is no golden rule about this.  What will apply is what is practical.  For example, if a person in Wexford who runs a plumbing business and has two employees wishes to lobby Brendan Howlin about water charges or anything else, is that something he should register?  I want people to be able to express themselves without inhibition.  Larger companies are in a position to do this in a more structured way than the small employer who is not far removed from the individual citizen.  There is not a lot of difference between the local plumber, who happens to employ two apprentices or an assistant, making his views known and him as John citizen making known his views, which he should be entitled to do without hindrance.  In regard to whether the threshold could be eight rather than ten employees, the answer is yes but one has to make a determination in this regard.  We have made the modification in relation to the categories of people who are professionally lobbying, even if a small group of people at the core if they represent a cohort of other people.  For example, if a plumbers' advocacy group comprising four employees at the top represented a big cohort of people it would be captured.<\/p><p> In regard to turnover, one could make things more complicated but I have tried to make this as simple as possible.  The current threshold for audit is in excess of &euro;8 million.  A &euro;5 million turnover company would be audit exempt under the Companies Act.  Whether we should have a threshold level that drifts into a particular turnover at a particular point in time in the context of whether people would or would not be captured, the provision as drafted seeks to provide as much certainty as possible.  I ask that Deputies opposite give these particular proposals fair wind until we bed them down.  If we need to tweak them in 12 months time we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500006#E00500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416928200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>It is proposed to issue guidelines in relation to appointments of State boards.

They refer to the charitable sector.  In the course of the Minister's consultation, charities were keen to tell him that, given their belief that their standing had been damaged to some extent by the controversies that emerged and were explored by the Oireachtas, they wished to be captured within the State's transparency mechanisms, including this legislation.  Therefore, I am surprised that their wish has not been reflected in the Bill.  For example, The Wheel, on behalf of its 8,000 members, has made clear that it wants to be subject to the transparency and accountability regulations contained in the Bill.  It believes that the legislation should set out to cover its advocacy activities consistent with advancing its legitimate, charitable purpose.  It has received advice from the Revenue Commissioners that this is a complex procedure.  As such, my amendment to section 5 on the meaning of &quot;carrying on lobbying activities&quot; tries to capture charities' need and wish to be included so that there is no uncertainty in the public mind about their transparency and their charitable status in the eyes of Revenue is protected.  Each of my amendments caters for this issue.  If the Minister believes that the wording is imperfect, I would be open to working on it, but accepting the idea behind them is important, not least because the sector has made it clear that it wishes to be captured within this regulatory framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Deputy Mary Lou McDonald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416928800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>We can deliver to Deputy McDonald exactly what she wants, namely, that charitable organisations be captured by the provisions of the registration without impacting on their charitable status.

Therefore, a specific head covering this issue was included in the general scheme of the Bill as published.<\/p><p>  The first chief executive of the new Charities Regulatory Authority was appointed in March, with the authority being formally established on 1 October of this year under the terms of the Charities Act 2009.  The legal advice is to the effect that the Registration of Lobbying Bill will not change the current legal position in respect of the status of charities.  In light of that advice, it is unnecessary as a matter of law to include anything on charities in this Bill as previously proposed in the general scheme.<\/p><p>  My officials have met the Revenue Commissioners and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Under the Charities Act, a body that promotes a political cause - unless the promotion of that cause relates directly to the advancement of the charitable purposes of the body - is excluded from charitable status.  The Charities Regulatory Authority has confirmed its intention to develop written guidelines for charities on how the authority will implement these provisions of the Act.  The authority and Revenue have confirmed that this guidance will be developed in full consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Eligibility for a charitable tax exemption is and will remain a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

The purpose of this exemption is to ensure the large volumes of normal daily communications between public servants are not subject to registration requirements.  It will be possible under section 6(1)(g) for the Minister to prescribe a person as a designated public official, that is, a person who is lobbied or &quot;the lobbied&quot; in bodies other than public service bodies.  The purpose of amendment No. 30 is to ensure the exemption equally applies to staff in other bodies in which the newly prescribed designated public official works or holds office.  The effect of the amendment is that if, for example, the chief executive officer of a commercial semi-State body is prescribed as a designated public official, communications between the staff of that body and between a public service body such as, for example, the parent Department, do not require registration.  In other words, the commercial semi-State body would be regarded as &ldquo;the lobbied&rdquo; and enjoy the same protection from this exemption as that of other public service bodies.<br\/>I note the following amendment, No. 31, tabled by both Deputies Sean Fleming and Mary Lou McDonald relates to section 5(3)(k) and, as the Chairman has indicated, will fall if my amendment is accepted.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel also has suggested some changes to the wording of the exemption to ensure it is consistent with the wording of section 7 relating to &ldquo;public servant&rdquo;.  These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment.  In essence, my point is I have already included in the Bill that normal communication between officials in a Department or between Departments - for example, if my Department talks to the Department of Finance - does not constitute lobbying and cannot be captured by that provision.  Equally, normal communications between Departments and agencies that are designated outside the Civil Service such as, for example, a commercial semi-State body if it was communicating with its parent Department will also enjoy that exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500010#J02200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I note that members are discussing amendments Nos. 30 and 31 together.  While I understand the Minister's point, I have a different view on it, which is why I believe this paragraph should be deleted, as should the Minister's amendment he proposes in lieu of the existing paragraph.  The Minister's amendment should not be proceeded with and I will provide an example I have already mentioned.  If one take Dublin Bus and the proposals to privatise some of its routes, under the Minister's amendment, communications between Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and their parent Department need not be registered as lobbying under this legislation.  If other companies which might be involved in the proposed privatisation of some of the routes are lobbying on precisely the same issue, they will be obliged to register their interests, whereas as the Minister has just noted, a semi-State company communicating with a parent Department will not be so obliged.  This is not right, is not equal and is unfair.  I note that many semi-State bodies now are in an area which involves competition.  For example, what if Aer Lingus is communicating with its parent Department which owns the 25% of the airline currently in public ownership?  What about the example of AIB, of which the State owns 99.8%, if it wished to lobby the Minister for some change?  What if another bank, not under State control, wishes to lobby on precisely the same issue and point?  It is wrong that there should be a new inside track created for commercial semi-State bodies or organisations that are owned by the State, whereas organisations in direct competition with them do not have the same line of access.  The electricity sector provides another example.  There was a time when the ESB was a State monopoly, but that is no longer the case, as it probably supplies approximately 40% of the electricity used in the State.  The amendment provides that if the ESB wants to get across a point of view to its parent Department, it can engage in all of the lobbying if likes and it need not be registered because it will only be communicating with its parent Department, whereas if any of the other companies producing electricity wished to lobby on precisely the same point, because they would not be lobbying their parent Department, they would be obliged to register.  That is my understanding of the Minister's proposal, although perhaps I am misinterpreting him.  Perhaps he might clarify the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500010#J02300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416930000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>My point is that the same entity cannot be \"the lobbied\" and \"the lobbying\".<\/p> <p>Communications between members of the same Department are exempt because it is understood that if a principal officer is talking to an assistant secretary, that is not lobbying.  I am providing for where an external person is designated, but it is not automatic that every semi-State body will be designated for this purpose.  That is something we will debate.  As can be seen, AIB is not on the list of bodies to be designated under section 6.  In the same vein, many communications on public policy, reviews and so on between agencies of a Department and that Department would be deemed to be normal, as if they were between civil servants within a Department.  This is not lobbying.<\/p><p> On the issue of transparency, it is captured by more than lobbying only.  We must have a narrow focus in the Bill on what constitutes \"lobbying\".  It is something that sets out to change public policy, whereas there are other mechanisms such as FOI legislation and the open data initiative I have described through which general information should be in the public domain.  I go some of the way with the Deputy, but AIB is a bad example to use because it is an anomaly that we own 99% of a bank that is not a semi-State company in the normal sense of the word.  It is Government policy that this will not remain the position.  The Deputy is right; I would have a different view if AIB was lobbying on banking policy that had uniform application rather than communicating with the shareholder, which is different.  I will reflect further on the issue to ensure the point the Deputy has made is captured.  If it is normal communication between the bank and its prime shareholder, it cannot be regarded as lobbying.<\/p><p> On AIB being in a position to be exempt under the Bill in terms of lobbying on general banking issues, that is not the case because it is not a designated body.

In essence, if they do not abide by the transparency code set out, they are captured by the Bill because they are not exempt.  I do not want every working group to be regarded as lobbyists, one for another.  I do not think Deputy McDonald wants that either.

Bits and pieces of NAMA were sold off for &euro;200 or &euro;300 million rather than having decent offers of &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion.  That level of lobbying has the potential to have a more significant impact for the future of Irish finances than everything which could be captured under this Bill.  There is no mechanism in the Bill to deal with that.  <\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance, another Minister or other people we have mentioned could easily be lobbied.  Had a meeting like that in Davos happened in a Minister's office or elsewhere in the State, it would be captured under lobbying legislation.  It could happen at a European Council meeting.  Who knows who a Minister could meet in the course of his or her meetings.  I recall the Minister, Deputy Noonan, returned after the Davos trip and said we would consider larger tranches of the NTMA.  It may or may not have been unconnected.  Macro lobbying is a very serious issue and people are not just concerned about micro lobbying.  The Minister can understand from where I am coming.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 50 states: \"Where a designated public official is lobbied by an organisation from outside of the State, the onus shall be on that public official to register the fact that he or she had been so lobbied and that public official shall provide the necessary information to the Standards in Public Office Commission\" or some other body.  I do not think in this day and age, given the level of communications, it is possible that an organisation from outside the State cannot be covered.  Organisations based in the State will have to register.  Perhaps it does cover organisations that are lobbying designated public officials such as Minister, but do so from outside the State.

The Deputy is talking about requiring financial disclosure as part of the registration system.  As I indicated, we engaged in a great deal of consultation on the Bill with lobbyists, users and a variety of groups.  The consultation process highlighted the need to strike a balance between the real requirements of transparency and ensuring there was commercial confidentiality for some commercially sensitive information.  Account must also be taken of the significant administrative issues involved in establishing consistent and comparable financial data which could be included in the register.  This is particularly the case in relation to in-house lobbyists, of whose time only a small proportion is spent on lobbying and where such financial data are not currently collected.  They might be doing a dozen other things at the same time.<\/p><p>  The disclosure of financial data presupposes also that disclosure can give us an insight into the effectiveness of lobbying.  We want to know this because we want to know in a transparent way who is influencing public policy.  As we know, however, it is often not the amount of money spent by a lobbyist that is the most effective way to determine his or her impact.  I am reminded of having reflected on the matter that this is too burdensome to put on people at the outset of the process.  It would be resisted by lobbying companies and the normal lobbyists such as the IFA, the ICTU and others who lobby us as a matter of course.

My amendment is very clear.  I am asking that a subsection be included relating to the returns to be made by registered persons to provide that the section does not apply to unpaid volunteers of an organisation that is otherwise a registered person for the purposes of the legislation.<br\/>An obvious one that comes to mind is the IFA which will have a system in place as a registered organisation and comply completely.

The same could happen with members of trade unions or any other group.  The group working on the dreaded EirGrid pylons might register as a lobbyist group if it were to retain an employee.  One meets volunteers every day of the week or volunteers in an area might come to us with a local concern.  It is pure voluntarism involving ordinary citizens expressing their interest in an area.  They know that their national organisations will be registered and making official returns.

This section provides for two scenarios where publication can be delayed.  One is where the State&rsquo;s interests are at risk and the other is where the individual's business is likely to suffer a material loss.

A more practical approach to the realities of business and private affairs should be considered - that is, on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  The provision allows the commission to revoke a delayed publication decision and mandates the commission to inform the applicant that the determination has now been revoked.

I do not think that should be the case.  Notwithstanding that these would not be people who were members of Government when exiting the system and taking up this employment, nonetheless they, or we, could be reasonably depicted as insiders and therefore potentially influence peddlers.  My amendment seeks to strike the exemption of Deputies, Senators, MEPs and councillors from those requirements.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 relate to the cooling-off period required before somebody can uninhibitedly work as a lobbyist without clearance by anybody.  The Bill sets the conditional period at one year and I believe it would be more appropriate to set it at two years.  We have had this discussion on cooling-off periods previously in respect of other legislation.  I do not believe two years is excessively onerous.  It is reasonable, all the more so because it is not an absolute prohibition but just a period of time within which conditions have to be met and clearance has to be given to the individual in question to take up a lobbyist's role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500021#U00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1416936000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>The imposition of restrictions on post-term employment on relevant designated public officials must be proportionate and practical.  We have taken very careful advice because people have constitutional rights.  The categories included are Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisors, public servants of a prescribed description - in the first instance they will be Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general, CEOs of local authorities and directors of services of local authorities.<br\/>These are the categories of office-holders of officials who are most likely to have worked personally or substantially on the types of policy matters this provision is intended to address.  These are also the categories of persons who are most likely to have direct links back to individual public bodies and be in a position to be influential in lobbying such bodies.<br\/>This would not be the case for Members of these Houses by virtue of their very differing role.  Similarly, I do not believe that it would be proportionate to apply a one-year cooling-off period to members of local authorities in light of their part-time role. <br\/>It is something we might think about.  It would be a shock if we told newly-elected local authority members that there was a restriction on their future employment for a period of a year.  I do not believe that is proportionate and that is why I believe they should be exempted.  I have given some consideration to these matters and the provisions in the Bill are proper and proportionate and will meet objective criteria without being excessively onerous or impacting on people's right to work.<br\/>On amendments Nos. 92 and 93, the cooling-off period is limited to one year.  Again the provision must be proportionate and practical to operate.  We have to ensure that the cooling-off period deals with the public policy objective, which is to prevent what has been characterised as an immediate &ldquo;switching of sides&rdquo; - whereby a poacher becomes gamekeeper or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is balanced with the personal rights and freedoms of an individual to earn a living.<br\/>It is increasingly difficult to get people of calibre to find the public service acceptable because of the degree of scrutiny under which public servants of all ilks, including volunteers on committees, rightly now find themselves.  There are the Standards in Public Office Commission registration requirements and other things.  In each case we need a proportionate and balanced approach.  I believe one year after leaving a job is a sufficient period of time to address that issue.<br\/>This approach reflects a review of the duration of similar provisions in other jurisdictions which highlighted that the introduction of a two-year restriction for a relatively wide range of public officials would fall into the upper-end of the international norms, notwithstanding that there are even longer cooling-off periods in some jurisdictions.<br\/>The one-year period also aligns with the current post-public employment restriction in place under the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour.  This provision is focused on lobbying activity.  I will be reviewing the wider issues relating to conflict of interest in the ongoing current review of the ethics legislation.  We will return to that matter when we introduce the new ethics Bill.  As the Deputy knows, I plan to consolidate the ethics legislation into one enactment and to have regard for the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal and other tribunals in doing so.  We will have an opportunity to deal with direct conflicts of interest in that regard.<br\/>Amendment No. 94 is a technical amendment to ensure that there is consistency of phrasing in the Bill.<br\/>Amendment No. 95 was requested by SIPOC so that it can determine the manner and form in which applications for consent under section 22, which relates to restrictions on post-term employment as lobbyist, should be submitted to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014112500021#U00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1416936000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister.  I do not think a two-year cooling off period is disproportionate, particularly since it does not represent an outright ban on taking up lobbying activities.  It simply requires that the persons have clearance to do so.  I know we have talked about cooling-off periods before.  I think two years is appropriate.  It does not represent an outright prohibition on lobbying and much less an outright prohibition on the person's constitutional right to work.

I was also asked by the Government to look at social problems in Limerick, which were problematic at that time.  Consequent to that report to Government, I was asked to chair the agency that was set up to deal with those problems.  It was set up for five years with a sunset clause that at the end of five years it would go back into local government.  It is now part of the new single authority in Limerick and is still working very successfully there.<\/p><p>  The committee is quite familiar with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and we have been here before, so I will not go into too much detail.  It was talked about for a long time and eventually when it was set up it was to be a single-purpose authority to bring all transport modes together, which had been pretty disparate in the past, and to bring those into line with infrastructural provision through the planning process.  The two areas had operated almost separately since the foundation of the State.  It started off as a Dublin body, the Dublin Transport Authority; then its remit was extended nationally and it became the National Transport Authority, with specific planning responsibilities as well.  The legislation that established the NTA is very complex, but if one were to boil it down to one sentence in the Act, it is the one that defines its role as \"the development of an integrated transport system which contributes to environmental sustainability and social cohesion and promotes economic progress\".  That says it all.  It takes in both the transport and planning aspects.  The NTA has an extensive and growing list of functions.  This growing list means extra responsibilities and pressures on us, but we accept that as Government acclamation, in a sense, that the authority is doing well and that the Government is prepared to entrust it with more activities than we had before.  We have many more activities now than we had in the past.  The full list is much to long to discuss here, but the main ones are the contracts with CIE, the provision of integrated ticketing and transport information, the development of the public transport system through capital investment, the licensing of commercial bus services, management and expansion of the rural transport programme, which is the latest addition to the list; the provision of cycling and bus infrastructure, including new buses - Dublin Bus is buying in about 80 new buses and refurbishing many others; the development of a single public transport brand, which we have never had before; and regulation of taxis and hackneys, which is also a more recent development.<\/p> <p> The authority has an annual income of approximately &euro;450 million and we spend most of that on subsidies to the CIE companies, as well as a range of things that provide much value for money through local authorities and other agencies.  We have big ticket items like the Luas cross-city range, right through to bus shelters.<\/p><p> I have provided the Chairman with a copy of the annual report and there are copies available also for other members of the committee.  That gives an overview of what we are at, but I will mention a couple of them.  We published two major plans for greater Dublin which accounts for about 40% of the State&rsquo;s transport, population and economic activity.  We published the integrated implementation plan, which was approved by the Minister during the year.  We also published the cycle network plan for the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p> We are doing everything we can to prioritise the development of initiatives that will boost the image of public transport.  To summarise, we are making public transport more attractive rather than beating people out of their cars.  A lot of people are reluctant to be beaten out of their cars but we want to make the public transport offering as attractive as possible, so that people will choose to use it.  There is evidence that that is happening.<\/p><p> Members of the committee know the figures.  The economy is growing again and we are preparing for the next period of economic activity, which means that there will be a lot more commuters, thankfully.  If every one of those commuters chooses to travel into city centres by car, we will not have enough space for them and the whole system will gum up.  Everything we are doing therefore is designed to encourage people to get out of cars and use public transport because it is more attractive.<\/p><p> On 1 December, we will have the new five-year contracts with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, which are being signed at the moment.  Passenger numbers are growing again, thankfully.  They had been declining for the last few years.  We have decided to open up 10% of subsidised services to competitive tendering in order to introduce benchmark pricing of subsidised bus services.  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will be able to participate in that tender process.<\/p><p> A new contract for the operation of the Luas service was awarded this year also.  In recent months, we have worked closely with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann which has had particular financial problems.  We are looking closely at the operation of the whole rail network in trying to define what exactly is needed to finance Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the long term.<\/p><p> In 2013, construction started on the Luas cross-city project.  It not only connects both Luas lines, but also runs right up to Grangegorman and connects with the western line.  The reality is that while the Luas is visually attractive and adds a lot to the city, the dependence for the time being will be mainly on buses.  We are therefore putting a lot of effort into developing the bus system, including new bus corridors.  One of the current priorities is the one linking Swords to the city centre, which is going through a public consultation process at the moment.  We are putting a lot of effort into that one and there are two others to follow once we get that consultation process finished.<\/p><p> In the meantime, heavy rail is not being forgotten.  We are hoping to re-open the tunnel that runs under the Phoenix Park, which would open up all kinds of possibilities to link the south and south west of the city with the city centre, as well as with the south east of the city where a lot of economic activity is happening at the moment.<\/p><p> The Government has introduced legislation to tighten up the taxi sector considerably.  We are in the business of implementing that at the moment.  <\/p><p> In addition, a lot of work is being done on rural transport.  It is something that has been talked about for years and the objective is to try to tidy and tighten it up, making is more cost-effective by reducing the number of bodies involved.  It is not just about that, however.  Being from rural Ireland myself, I know what it is like for people who live in rural areas but do not have a car.  It is important for them to have an alternative, which is the public transport system.  We are trying to ensure that new measures are introduced if the existing system is not good enough.<\/p><p> The bike scheme has been very successful in Dublin.  It was launched in Galway yesterday, and will be in Cork and Limerick within the next few days. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014112500004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416918000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>The organisation is young, having been set up only five years ago.  It has been regarded as being very successful.  The ultimate accolade is that we have been asked to take on more functions in recognition of the fact that we do them well.  Much of what we do is on the transport side but there is a powerful emphasis also on the land use planning side, sometimes that is forgotten.  Even the name, the National Transport Authority, suggests it is only a transport body.  We spend much time working with regional and planning authorities.  We have had serious problems in the past concerning housing estates built in areas where there was no public transport or shopping centres.  We have much power in terms of how we work with regional and local authorities.  We try to work largely by consensus and this works well.  We meet with them frequently and discuss the issues and generally they are happy with what we are trying to do.  We are very conscious of our role and our accountability to the Government and the committee, and we are at pains to ensure that any information required by the committee, including parliamentary questions, are dealt with expeditiously.<\/p><p>  The board has done a good job.  I pay tribute to a number of the members who are stepping down now at the end of the five year term.

I have been on the council with him for many years and am well aware of his ability.  There are a few areas about which I am concerned.  Following recent conversations with the Minister I am alarmed in regard to a number of issues but, particularly, the recent price increases for Dublin Bus.  He attributed a certain amount of the increases to the input of the NTA.  I would like to hear Mr. Fitzgerald's position on it.  Given the increasing number of people using public transport it does not appear to make sense.  We have had many price increases in recent years.  The people who are most affected are the least well off because they tend to pay cash.  It is well and good saying one can get better value with the Leap card but one must be able to hand over cash to get a Leap card.  Many ordinary working class people will board a bus with a child and pay cash.  They are the people who are hit hardest.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the farming out of 10% of the services, I believe the NTA should protect the existing services.  We can talk about whether we are obliged to go out to tender or otherwise.  The reality is that 10% of the service is to be farmed out, including 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Waterford.  That will have a huge impact and is a drive towards privatisation.  In the past, the authority was never in favour of privatisation.<\/p> <p>Will Mr. Fitzgerald outline his position on that issue?<\/p><p> The proposal to reduce taxi prices is causing havoc.  On the one hand, Dublin Bus fares are being increased while, on the other, taxi prices are to be reduced under the latest proposals.  I cannot understand the rational for this decision, especially as additional charges are being imposed on the taxi industry.  Resetting meters and the other significant readjustments required cost money.  While I accepted most of the recommendations of the taxi industry review group, I did not agree with all of them.  This proposal will mean the taxi industry having to take another hit. <\/p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald referred to a number of major traffic projects.  I have attended the consultations on the proposal for rapid bus routes.  The cost of the proposed Swords route would be approximately &euro;200 million.  Has the possibility of investing this &euro;200 million in existing bus services been considered?  The proposed Swords route will also affect the business of private operators on the route.  Has consideration been given to investing in improvements to existing routes, for example, in terms of set-down locations, road widening works, extending the routes and making them more bus friendly?  I am not convinced the rapid bus proposals would provide value for money in the long run.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to outline his position on the matter. <\/p><p> On the Luas extension to Broombridge, has consideration been given to extending the line further to Finglas?  This option could be completed quicker than the original metro north proposal, which was to go through Ballymun, Finglas or Santry.  Has the idea of extending the service from Broombridge to Finglas and subsequently to Dublin Airport been considered?  It would not be as costly as metro north and could be done above ground, unlike some of the other proposals. <\/p><p> We have been given an assurance that the Jack Lynch tunnel would not be tolled.  Does Mr. Fitzgerald have an opinion on the issue?  Is the decision one for the local authority or will the National Transport Authority have an input in any such decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014112500006#G00300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416918300,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I will take the questions in reverse order.

While I am not sure if the option the Deputy has raised will form part of the final shake-up, I am fairly certain it will be examined as part of the study.  The intention is to extend the Luas line to Broombridge.

When we first introduced the concept of quality bus corridors along the Airport Road and the N11 to Wexford, the Deputy will recall the opposition to them at the time.  People told us they would never work and we would destroy every business along the route.  They have been hugely successful, however.  This is an advance on this.  Some would say the super bus corridors are good alternatives to light rail or even heavy rail.  I am not sure I would go along with that entirely.  Where they have run, they are very successful and cost effective.  A price of &euro;200 million for such a system is relatively cheap compared to the prices we are quoted for alternatives.<\/p><p> The taxi advisory group is reviewing taxi fares and there will be probably be a recommendation for an increase.

It is an attempt to produce price comparators and see what the private sector can do with prices and competitiveness.  The CIE companies can compete and may well win the competition.  I expect they will compete and will be in with the same chance as every other operator.  It is not privatisation.  The staff&rsquo;s concerns include the two-pay rights of transfer if the CIE companies do not win it.  The objective is to pick routes that will provide us with an opportunity to assess the performance of CIE against the performance of private operators.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, believes this should be done as there is a legal imperative on us to do it anyway.  Unless we can assure the Government there is no private sector option available, then we are obliged to examine that.<\/p><p>  There are discussions going on with the unions on this and will be held again in January.  I hope we can go a long way towards meeting their concerns.  I accept there are concerns that the whole of Waterford city&rsquo;s operations are involved.  However, one cannot divide Waterford into several sections.  We were anxious to pick one provincial city where it could be tested.  That is all we are doing - testing.  The other routes are designed to be large enough to produce a measure but not large enough to banjax any other part of the system.<\/p><p>  I wish we could have avoided any public transport fare increases.  The authority&rsquo;s objective is to encourage people to use public transport, especially people who cannot afford private cars.  While I would love to say we could avoid a fare increase, it is not possible when the subvention from the Exchequer to the company is down by 30% and usage over the past several years is down by 17%.  I accept, however, it is growing and is back up now by about 3%.<\/p> <p> We are a regulator.  We have not been put under pressure by anybody to do anything.  We are an independent body and we have volumes of correspondence from companies and various interest groups on what should and should not be done.  All I can say is that we are not happy, and the public is not happy, with the increases.  I do not believe any of the companies are happy with the increases they got.  It is a bit of a juggling act in terms of trying to weigh up what is needed by them against what we believe should be imposed on the public.  The reality is that in view of the loss of subvention, the loss of passenger numbers and the increases in the costs of fuel, which have been a huge factor in recent years, although they are dropping again now but they buy their fuel forward, if we, as the regulator, did not concede increases we would not have a public transport system.

I join in the thanks expressed to the retiring chief executive officer and the members of the board for the work they have done.<\/p><p>  Mr. Fitzgerald knows well the part of the world I represent.  For the National Transport Authority to be what it says on the tin, it should also encompass roads.  I do not believe we will ever get an integrated transport network in Ireland while we have an agency responsible for roads, an agency responsible for local roads, namely, the local authority, and the National Transport Authority, which is responsible for practically everything that goes on in Dublin in terms of public transport infrastructure.  While an effort has been made to merge the Rail Procurement Agency with the National Roads Authority, the National Transport Authority should be what it says on the tin, namely, responsible for all elements of transport and not just those areas within the M50 which it currently covers.<\/p><p>  Regarding the areas outside the M50, I compliment the NTA's taxi and hackney sub-committee chaired by Pat Byrne.  I met the members recently on an issue the members of this committee will be blue in the face hearing me raise.  In terms of the part of the world from which Mr. Fitzgerald originates, if he were to apply for a hackney licence in Anglesborough he would be expected to know on what street in Glin is the post office or where in Foynes is Mount Trenchard.<\/p> <p>A person collecting a hackney fare in Anglesboro, Kilbehenny, Ballyfaskin, Ballylanders or anywhere in that part of the country will probably need to know more about Mitchelstown, Cahir or Tipperary town than about Abbeyfeale or Athea.  It is three years since I started raising this, and my jaws are worn at this stage.<\/p><p> To be fair, the hackney and taxi committee met me and listened to what I said.  It will have its own deliberations on it.  However, it never fails to bamboozle me that a person in Goleen in west Cork is expected to know where the AIB in Mitchelstown is simply because it happens to be in the same county.  It is ludicrous.  Whatever else Mr. Fitzgerald does in the next two and a half years he is in office, will he please try to get rid of that system?  It assesses people in rural areas on their ability to deliver a public service based on this notional thing called a county, which we were left with by the British.  If one is from Deputy O'Mahony's part of the world, near the town of Ballaghaderreen on the Roscommon border in east Mayo, one will be asked about Belmullet, Killala, Cong and other such places, to which one will probably never travel, but one will not be asked about the neighbouring parish on the other side of the river in County Roscommon.  This matter is really beginning to irritate me.<\/p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned heavy rail.  Limerick is by far the best-fed city in Ireland in terms of rail.  It has connections to Galway, Nenagh, through the junction to Tipperary and out to Foynes.  I believe two lines have potential.  The first is the Foynes line for freight.  Foynes is the deepest port in the country.  Given that all transport is under the remit of the authority, the authority's relationship with ports is something it might examine.  There is a rail corridor into the port of Foynes and it would be fantastic if it could be reopened for freight.  The possibility of extracted ore, bulk meal and bulk fertilisers arriving into the port, not to mention bulk exports, represents a fantastic opportunity.  I am aware that &Iacute;arnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is considering it but perhaps Mr. Fitzgerald would comment on that.<\/p><p> The other rail line that has potential is the Galway to Limerick line, which has been lampooned by some elements in the media.  There are still speed restrictions on it, despite massive capital investment.  It is a nice journey, but one would not want to be in a hurry.  The bus from Galway will bring one to Limerick faster.  That was not the original concept, which was to link Limerick to Sligo through Athenry and Mayo in the west.  There are speed restrictions and the line is flooded at certain times of the year.  The possibility of investment in the west of Ireland rail corridor to link Sligo to Limerick and Cork is reduced considerably due to the speed restriction that is maintained between Limerick and Athenry.  Perhaps Mr. Fitzgerald will refer to that as well.<\/p><p> Finally, all politics is local and all transport is local as well.  There has been a significant investment in cycling in city centres through bicycle rental schemes and so forth.  Parallel with that there is a network of greenways across the country, whose focus has been on the tourism package and on recreational bicycle use.  Does Mr. Fitzgerald envisage any relationship with those greenways in terms of the development of cycling in the future?

The rail review I adverted to some minutes ago is a job we are doing along with CIE.  CIE is not the only organisation involved; we are doing it too.  We have people working with CIE and we are looking hard at it.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann got into real trouble last year in terms of the amount of money available and in respect of the work it was expected to do.  Some of the rail lines are heavily oversubscribed but some are heavily underutilised too.  Let us consider the money end of it and the economics.  There are probably several railway lines which, one could argue, should not be there any more.  However, we are conscious of the social aspect of those lines.  We are also mindful of the potential tourist revenues that might flow from those if there were developed in that way as well, something Deputy O'Donovan referred to as well.  The line from Waterford to Limerick is heavily under-utilised but at the same time there is value in the route.<\/p><p>  The job we are doing with CIE is precisely what Deputy O'Donovan was referring to.  The idea is to examine the railway network, the cost of running it and what is required to keep it running as it is, on the assumption that we wish or can afford to keep it all running as it is.  Some lines are so heavily under-utilised that they cannot cost-justify themselves any more.  The objective is to try to make them cost-justify themselves.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to licences.  I was unaware of the issue of the role of licences.  However, Deputy O'Donovan appears to be successful in the sense that he keeps raising the matter.  Certainly, it has come to my consciousness in more recent times and it is being discussed.  We have been talking to the taxi advisory group about it, as has Deputy O'Donovan.  We have discussed it a good deal among ourselves.  Our systems probably have not been the best in terms of how to deal with it up to now.  They are far better now than they were.  It is something I will keep a close eye on myself because I know the issues involved rather well.<\/p><p>  There was a question about the National Roads Authority and ourselves.

I will not say one lies awake at night worrying about it, but one does not take it lightly.  I was asked by the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, to do the job.  I never asked for any of these jobs and never made a telephone call asking for them.  At the time I said \"No\" because I was doing many other things.  However, he came back and said he thought I was uniquely qualified for the job as I came from a planning and transport background and that was the kind of person he was seeking.  When one has one's ego stroked enough, one eventually gives in and I did take on the job and I am glad that I did.  The authority has been more successful than I had envisaged.  At the start I did not realise it would become a national organisation or that all of the other issues would be bolted on to it.  Looking back, I am pleased.  I said to the board members the other day that anybody who had been involved in it for the past five years should feel proud of what had been done.  Much of the credit for this rests with the individual running it, the CEO, Mr. Gerry Murphy.<\/p><p>  If I am back here in two and half years time, what is it that would I like to be able to say?  I would like to be able to say the organisation was buzzing, that there was great activity and that many good people worked hard and derived much satisfaction from it.  I would like to be able to say we had kept up the momentum and that we had the resources required.  If I was to pick one issue - having been involved in transport, public transport, and managing cities for a long time - it would be the need to increase the usage of public transport - in this I include people walking, cycling and using motorbikes.  We have tried for many years to increase the usage of public transport, but it is very difficult; it is a stubborn issue.  While bus usage is improving, car usage is down a little.  I would like to come back in two and a half years time and say we had achieved a significant modal shift, that it had not increased car numbers trying to access all city centres, not just Dublin, but that we had a public transport offering, in all of its shapes and forms, whether it be buses, trains, light rail, the DART, bicycles or motorbikes, similar to that on offer in any other European city, whereby people could get in and out easily and quickly without frustration and the congestion experienced in the past.  That is achievable.  <\/p><p>  In the past five years I have been involved in Limerick and Grangegorman and it has been a question of survival and trying to keep the show on the road.  The National Transport Authority is probably one of the few bodies that has taken on more work and increased its workload in that time.  All of the others have been trying to stay alive.  We are well placed to build on what is in place.  The amount of money we have received, &euro;450 million, is considerable.  Our staff are well trained and motivated.  The relationship we have with the company is difficult at times, but we have enough trust and confidence built between us.  At the beginning I did not think the transport companies could understand the need for a regulator and why one should be imposed at our level, but they have become accustomed to it.  There is mutual respect which may not have been the case in the past.  I am happy to say I could come back in two and a half years time and say we had not only maintained the momentum but built on and increased it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014112500012#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1416920100,"counter":812,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Fitzgerald envisage problems with the unions in implementing plans for the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014112500012#N00700","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416920100,"counter":813,"content":"<p>The opening of 10% of bus routes is a critical issue for the unions and will continue to be for a while.

I share the sentiments expressed by previous speakers about Mr. Gerry Murphy.  I ask the Chairman to pass on to him the good wishes of members.<br\/>On 3 January <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that &euro;225 million had been spent on shelved Dublin transport projects.  As an economist, I have a concern that these projects have a life of their own.  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the need for a regulator.  What happens is that a decision is taken to proceed with a project because many hundreds of millions of euro have been spent on it.  Why have we not heard of it?  I hope the National Transport Authority will have a strict standard of investment appraisal to stop unilateral schemes from taking off.  Letters issued to 5,000 home and business owners in Dublin city centre about compulsory purchase orders for the underground project.  I do not believe the Oireachtas has ever discussed whether this project would be worthwhile.  Nevertheless, it has taken on a life of its own. <br\/>The Heuston to Connolly rail link, to which Mr. Fitzgerald referred, will proceed in 2016.  It appears to be an attractive project, given that the track and electronic signalling are in place and the tunnel is maintained with concrete sleepers.  We have been paying for this line, if one likes, through the infrastructure budget.  Running trains on it, therefore, is a good idea.  The project will also open up Phibsboro, Cabra, the Phoenix Park, including Garda Headquarters and the zoo, and the nearby Army barracks and facilitate the running of trains from Drogheda to Newbridge, thereby linking the system.  The budget appears to be low by comparison with that for some of the other projects mentioned.  Given that the project has so much going for it, could it proceed quicker, especially as the track is ready?  We could use the rolling stock located at the back of the Point Depot and for which we do not have a market, although I understand it may be gentrified for the Orient Express, or we could take rolling stock from a line that is not used much.  <br\/>On tendering, it is the job of the regulator to introduce some novelty on this issue.  Since the court cases involving Pat Nestor and others, the number of buses travelling in each direction between Dublin and Galway has increased to approximately 60 a day.  The service has been a fantastic success.  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the development of public transport.  There are approximately 59 more bus drivers working on the Dublin-Galway route than when the monopoly was still in place.  I looked at an old timetable for the service which shows only one bus ran in each direction every day and it travelled through Mullingar.  I have observed among my students that the bus service from Dublin to Galway is the preferred choice of young people.  It operates 24 hours a day and is a major success that does not need a public subsidy.  There are signs that a similar service could be provided on the Dublin-Belfast and Dublin-Limerick routes.  These options were not available before the establishment of the regulator because the Department of Transport had to look after the incumbent.  The proposal for 10% competitive tendering could have dramatic results based on the experience of the Dublin-Galway service. <br\/>Deputy Dessie Ellis referred to the possibility of extending the Luas to Finglas.  What about extending it to Shankill at the other end?  This was the original intention, but it appears to have been lost somewhere along the way.  Extending the line to Shankill would provide for integration and would not cost very much.  Is it worth considering that idea?<br\/>Studies show that the quality bus corridors from Chapelizod and Palmerstown to Heuston Station and from Malahide and Stillorgan work very well.  The average speeds achieved on these routes are faster those achieved on most heavy rail services and the DART line.<\/p> <p>This needs to be brought out more for people to understand how successful these quality bus corridors, QBCs, are.  Separation of the QBCs adds to cost and can make them inflexible.  Other drivers do not tend to intrude into them.  Sometimes one does not need a 24-hour QBC and many of them are not used on Sundays.  Is there really a return on putting in barriers to separate them from the rest of the road?  To give credit to motorists, the majority observe the rules governing QBCs.<\/p><p> An applicant for a taxi licence must do a written examination on geographical knowledge.  We pointed out to the Minister recently in the Seanad that for a journey from Limerick city to nearby Birdhill, County Tipperary, the taxi driver would have been required to do two written examinations in two counties.  Sat Nav would tell a taxi driver the directions.  Are these examinations unnecessarily complex?  As Mr. Fitzgerald knows, Mr. Paul Gorecki is a critic of the unnecessary barriers erected in the taxi industry, he feels, at the behest of encumbent taxi licenceholders against newcomers.  He pointed to the high costs of providing a wheelchair accessible vehicle and requiring written examinations when Sat Nav would suffice.  Does it matter for a taxi driver based in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, where the Ulster Bank in Belmullet, County Mayo, is located?  The more public transport we get, the more its share will grow.  The encumbent operators, however, have been successful in devising ways of keeping new entrants out.<\/p><p> I wish Mr. Fitzgerald well in his renewed term.  The Department of Finance guidelines on projects required that all projects involving funding over &euro;20 million should be referred to the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has accumulated nearly &euro;225 million on projects.  Many of these seem to have a life of their own, providing a living for the guys carrying out the projects but not translating into anything on the ground that people could use.  This needs to be corrected.  The NTA is correcting this legacy of the Celtic tiger where projects grew and grew.  It is important to switch them off as the benefits will never be commensurate to the projects&rsquo; costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014112500013#O00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416921000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett has not said anything with which I disagree.  The NTA, however, is really good at project appraisal, so much so that the Minister asks the authority to be involved in project appraisal if it is not.  The authority has some good skilled people in this whole area.  I accept there have been projects in the past which cost much public money but were not cost-justified in the long run.<\/p><p>  We will be presenting a strategy to the Minister for the greater Dublin area, which accounts for 40% of the population, next year.  The DART underground issue will come to a head sometime next year as it is time-limited.  After a court action, notice for rail works must be served in a year and a half rather than the seven year limit in the past.  While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of all of this, the two big ticket projects - DART underground and metro north - will not go ahead for certain.<\/p> <p>Should one of them go ahead or not?  I would not even attempt to second guess that process at this stage but decisions on them are imminent.  We will produce a strategy for the Minister which will encompass the north Dublin study about which I spoke.  It will encompass the DART study about which I spoke and will bring a range of these things under the umbrella of a strategy for greater Dublin that did not really exist before.  <\/p><p> I do not think the Phoenix Park tunnel can be accelerated beyond 2016.  We have pushed it as hard as we possibly can but 2016 is pretty fixed at this stage.  It is very achievable.  <\/p><p> Senator Barrett is absolutely right about the private buses.  I would go so far as to say that the success of the private buses is a measure of how successful the Dublin Bus alternative could be if it is given a chance and allowed to run.  There is no subsidy for any of the private bus operators bar a very small one that involves a small subsidy because it is in an area where there is no take up.  Apart from that, all of the others operate without subsidy of any kind.  <\/p><p> I was not conscious of the local taxi licences as a big issue or as an issue until very recently.
