The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:<\/p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations)<\/p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)<\/p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works<\/p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services<\/p>  <p>  - More detailed technical  guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP<\/p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that Local Authorities like all Contracting Authorities are responsible for adhering to the procurement policy framework and for the individual procurement decisions they make.  In terms of adopting a consistent approach to public procurement,  I understand that the Local Government Management Agency provides advice and assistance to Local Authorities regarding national and EU procurement regulations and contract management issues affecting their activities and monitors legislative and case law developments to ensure its processes remain current in light of these developments and other best practice initiatives. <\/p>  <p>  I would add that, last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority, including the Local Authority Sector, to ensure they adhere to these rules.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  The solutions provided by the OGP include a broad range of Framework Agreements from which public bodies can draw down goods or service, and include areas as diverse as uniforms, food, legal services, IT, and electricity.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accountable Officers\/Accountable Persons are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[13221\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if an end to the roll-out of the use of public services cards for more services provided by the State will be recommended until such time as concerns over the use of the card have been addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>The recent concerns raised in relation to the Public Services Card have been comprehensively addressed through the provision of communications and guidance to clarify exactly what data the card contains, what it is used for, and its legal basis.\u00a0 The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, assisted by my Department, published a \"Comprehensive Guide To SAFE Registration and The Public Services Card\" last October, which is available on the DEASP website.\u00a0 Furthermore, a new website, psc.gov.ie, was recently launched.\u00a0 This\u00a0site includes\u00a0a detailed 'questions and answers' section addressing the concerns that have been raised of late in relation to the card and MyGovID.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, we intend to continue with the delivery plan for the card and MyGovID, as set out in the eGovernment Strategy published by Minister O&rsquo;Donovan last July.\u00a0 Obviously, we will continue to work with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and take on board any recommendations that arise from their ongoing review<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[13009\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the recent collapse of a company (details supplied) and previous problems with public private partnerships will lead the Government to review its commitment to such funding models for infrastructure and services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model is an internationally recognised model to design, build, finance, operate and maintain public infrastructure.  In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate and unforeseen development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market.  In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational.  These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues - which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the NDFA, who are procuring this PPP project on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, that in accordance with international best practice, this PPP contract includes detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member to ensure that the project proceeds on a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; basis with minimal disruption. <\/p>  <p>  Given the advanced state of these schools (approximately 90% completed) the NDFA does not envisage material disruption or delay to the works.  However the NDFA is actively monitoring the position in the context of the robust contractual protections provided for under the PPP contract. The NDFA are making every effort to ensure delivery of the schools in as timely a manner as possible. <\/p>  <p>  PPPs continue to provide benefits to the State as a procurement method which enables the public sector to harness the innovation, commercial and management expertise and efficiencies of the private sector to design, build, finance, operate and maintain State facilities with a specified residual life on handback.

The evidence-base and approach taken to the public capital investment plans in the NDP were strongly informed and guided by the assessment of key issues contained in:-<\/p>  <p>  - The Review of the 2015 Capital Plan published last September which confirmed the compelling case for increased public capital investment and identified priority sectors for increased investment.<\/p>  <p>  - The Infrastructure Demand and Capacity Analysis prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service in my Department published alongside the Review of the Capital Plan which assessed on the basis of available evidence the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s public capital stock and key drivers of future infrastructure demand.<\/p>  <p>  - The IMF Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) for Ireland which highlighted that while, by international standards, infrastructure management practices in Ireland are generally well developed there are a number of areas where significant improvements can be made to ensure that public investment is efficient and value-for-money.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP sets out &euro;116 billion in total public capital investment over the ten years of 2018-2027.  This includes &euro;91 billion Exchequer investment and &euro;25 billion commercial State Owned Enterprise investment.  Approximately &euro;60 billion of this Exchequer investment is new additional funding for the period 2022-2027.

The aggregate amount involved is &euro;765m over the three year period.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD and IMF find that the productive capacity of the economy and its growth potential can be raised by changing the composition of expenditure in favour of capital spending.  Against the backdrop of the current cyclical position of the economy, with the labour market approaching estimates of full employment, stronger than projected growth could potentially lead to overheating pressures.  However, the scale and pace of increased capital expenditure envisaged under the NDP is intended to minimise the contribution of public capital investment to overheating risks in the coming years.  In addition, it is important to recognise the impact of the very substantial public capital programme contained in the NDP on the supply side of the economy and productivity &ndash; the key driver of long-term economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[13217\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200036#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason the national development plan utilises public private partnerships in view of the concerns regarding the cost of these projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 summarises the key findings and recommendations agreed as part of the recent PPP review - the detailed report of which will be published shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  As noted in the NDP, PPPs have been very useful in the past in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects.  This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly, given their use of private finance, on an off-balance sheet basis.  This enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.<\/p>  <p>  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs, just as traditionally procured projects, are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20m are required under the Public Spending Cote to be subject to a Cost Benefit Analysis or Cost Effectiveness Analysis.  In addition, all public investment projects of this value must also be referred to the National Development Finance Agency for advice in terms of the options for financing and procuring the projects.   <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the NDP, PPPs will continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the Public Spending Code.<\/p>  <p>  While there are a number of previously announced PPP projects in the pipeline for delivery over the coming years, no further specific additional projects have been identified in the NDP for procurement by PPP at this stage.

These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for\u00a0goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to\u00a0public works,\u00a0contract conditions require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.\u00a0 Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.\u00a0Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the management of\u00a0a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.\u00a0 It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the public procurement process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Accounting Officers of\u00a0Government Departments\u00a0and Offices\u00a0are responsible under\u00a0Public Financial Procedures for the safeguarding of public funds and property under\u00a0their control; for the regularity and propriety of all the transactions in each Appropriation Account bearing\u00a0their signatures; and for the efficiency and economy of administration\u00a0of their Department\/Office.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission,\u00a0the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation\u00a0and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200037#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Proofing of Policies","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200037#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[10467\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200037#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way in which the work of his Department on gender quality budgeting will be monitored and inputted into the final programme for the budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>The ongoing work\u00a0in my Department regarding equality and gender budgeting\u00a0flows from the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.

As set out in the NDP, a potential growth rate of 2% in volume terms is assumed over the period 2022 to 2027.  This potential growth rate aligns with the most recent long-term growth projection from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s while being lower than the OECD long-term projection of almost 3% for that period.  <\/p>  <p>  The prudent approach taken to the macro-economic and public capital investment framework in the plan is confirmed in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s historic growth performance averaging about 4&frac12;% over the whole of the period from 1966 &ndash; 2017.  The 2% real growth assumption for 2022 to 2027 is supplemented with the conventional assumption that inflation will average 2% in line with the upper limit of the ECB&rsquo;s inflation target yielding a 4% nominal growth projection over the period.  <\/p>  <p>  The projections used for the National Development Plan are appropriately prudent and conservative in light of the research carried out by the ESRI and Copenhagen Economics on Brexit. According to the Copenhagen Economics study, the more recent of these reports, in a scenario of a European Economic Area (EEA) agreement with the U.K. potential growth in the period 2030 is projected to be reduced to an annual average of 2%.  Similarly, a hard Brexit is projected to reduce potential growth in the period to 2030 to an annual average of 1.7%.  The baseline in that report is 2.2% growth in GDP per annum.<\/p>  <p>  This is compared to the 2% projection underlying the NDP.  Furthermore, the Copenhagen Economics study does not take account of the impact of the very substantial public capital programme contained in the NDP on the supply side of the economy and productivity &ndash; the key driver of long-term economic growth.<\/p>  <p>  In comparison to 2018, capital expenditure will increase by 25% in 2019, 35% in 2020 and 38% in 2021.

Under those Schemes, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. <\/p>  <p>  Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;8.94 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  However, under the pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare State Pension Contributory, that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on when the insured person was born.  The foregoing pension scheme rules were applied to the person in\u00a0question when he\u00a0qualified\u00a0for the State Pension at age 66 in 2013.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. <\/p>  <p>  Integration means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service where standard integration applies. In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the retirement pension starts payment, for example from age 60 where &lsquo;standard pension accrual&rsquo; applies.  However, these NCOs or Privates who serve 31 years having joined the Defence Forces at age 18\/20, can qualify for maximum retirement benefits payable immediately from age 49\/51.  In their case, the integration process only begins when the State Pension becomes payable to them, for example, at age 66.  Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of the State Pension (&euro;238.30 currently) is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pension arrangements by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension. <\/p>  <p>  The general issue of integration of retirement pensions in the public service was examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions.  Its Final Report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued.  It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[13271\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps taken by the EU and the international community to protect the Christian presence in the occupied Palestinian Territories including Jerusalem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[13272\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to reports that attempts have been made to curb the rights and privileges of a number of churches in the occupied Palestinian Territories; his views on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[13274\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200038#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts being made by the Government, the EU and the international community to preserve the status quo of the Holy Land sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 49 together.<\/p><p>There are considerable and well-known sensitivities in relation to the position of the Christian communities in Israel and Palestine, and also to the Holy Places of Christians, Jews and Muslims, especially in and around Jerusalem. Concerns around these issues have led to significant tensions and even violence in recent years, which we have discussed in the Oireachtas. <\/p><p>The issues involved can be very complex and multifaceted.  There are many Christian denominations present, and their churches and traditional status and rights predate not only the foundation of Israel but even the former British Mandate, and go back to the Ottoman period or even earlier.  Some European partners have historical and treaty links to various Christian denominations, and the Jordanian Government retains a role as guardians of the Muslim holy places.  Jerusalem is uniquely sensitive, and Israel&rsquo;s discriminatory treatment of Palestinians and their land rights under the occupation has meant that any proposed changes to the regime pertaining to religious properties are viewed with deep suspicion.<\/p><p>I do not wish to comment on the specific issues which led to the brief closure as a protest of some of the Christian churches in Jerusalem last month. While the immediate threat was lifted, and the churches reopened, these matters are not resolved and could recur. <\/p><p>However, both Ireland and the European Union have consistently and on a number of occasions in recent years stressed the important principle that there should be no change in the <i>status quo<\/i>with regard to religious affairs, properties and rights in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territory, pending the final resolution of the position of the city and the holy places in a peace agreement.  I have made this point myself directly to the Israeli authorities, and I repeat that principle again now.  My Department has also met with religious representatives from the city and the region.

It also included a programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes including a &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; provision under excise law for oil traders, that have been introduced over a number of Finance Acts, to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to introduce from the beginning of April 2015, in Ireland and the United Kingdom, a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel in recent years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted National Random Sampling Programmes in 2016, 2017 and 2018 with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programmes involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the marker introduced in 2015.  In all three years, no evidence of this marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This constitutes persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has resulted in the near elimination of selling of laundered product at retail level.  The available evidence to date indicates that Accutrace cannot be laundered by conventional methods.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that while the effectiveness of the measures introduced over the last few years is very welcome as is the very positive outcome of the collaboration with HMRC, Revenue is not complacent and is mindful of the resourcefulness of those involved in criminality in the fuel trade.  Revenue remains vigilant and ready to respond to any new developments in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, the use of analytics and detection technologies, optimising the deployment of resources and extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis.<\/p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade in tobacco at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Action has also been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Revenue, who in a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as part of the Joint Agency Task Force, last week closed down an illicit commercial cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth.  I understand from Revenue that this was the first time a commercial illicit cigarette production plant was discovered in the State and the factory was in full operation when Revenue officers and the Armed Support Unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na entered the premises.  Revenue officers found more than 60 tonnes of tobacco, all the pre-cursor components for the manufacture of cigarettes, and approximately 25 million cigarettes ready for distribution.  This was a sophisticated self-contained operation with machinery capable of producing 250,000 illicit cigarettes per hour and pre-processing, processing and packaging facilities, along with living quarters.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing the overall effectiveness in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS\/MRBI for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive.  The survey in 2017 found that 13% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit.  This figure is slightly up from the levels of 12% and 10% reported in 2015 and 2016 respectively but is nevertheless lower than in earlier years.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority.  In addition, I can say to the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance their capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200039#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200039#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[13520\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200039#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the statement undertaken by his Department regarding the financing and output of new housing by a company (details supplied); the conclusions his Department has drawn from the study; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>On 29 November 2017 I met with representatives of Cairn Homes to discuss the Irish housing market and to get their perspective on issues affecting the market as residential builders of significant scale.

This potential growth rate aligns with the most recent long-term growth projection from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s while being lower than the OECD long-term projection of almost 3% for that period.  <\/p><p>The prudent approach taken to the macro-economic and public capital investment framework in the plan is confirmed in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s historic growth performance averaging about 4&frac12;% over the whole of the period from 1966 &ndash; 2017.

According to the Copenhagen Economics study, the more recent of these reports, in a scenario of a European Economic Area (EEA) agreement with the U.K. potential growth in the period 2030 is projected to be reduced to an annual average of 2%.  Similarly, a hard Brexit is projected to reduce potential growth in the period to 2030 to an annual average of 1.7%.  The baseline in that report is 2.2% growth in GDP per annum.<\/p><p>This is compared to the 2% projection underlying the NDP.

In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to ensure that the project proceeds to completion.  The case the Deputy refers to highlights the prudential need for and value of such arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.<\/p>  <p>  This process is underway in the case of the Schools Bundle 5 PPP (as a consequence of the Carillion plc liquidation).  Liquidation of a company such as Carillion plc is an unfortunate development but would impact all projects regardless of whether procured traditionally or by means of a PPP.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific. <\/p>  <p>  The contractual mechanisms within a PPP project agreement are designed to limit the State&rsquo;s financial exposure in such a scenario.  An important feature of PPPs (which does not arise in traditional procurement) is that no payments are made until the facilities are handed over to the State and are operational.  Once facilities are operational, payments to the PPP company are linked to service performance and availability of the facilities over the lifetime of the contract, and deductions apply when the facilities are not performing or are unavailable.  The latter payment mechanism is not a feature of a traditional model which has regular milestone payments during construction.<\/p>  <p>  PPPs continue to provide benefits to the State as a procurement method which enables the public sector to harness the innovation, commercial and management expertise and efficiencies of the private sector to design, build, finance, operate and maintain State facilities with a specified residual life on handback.  PPPs will continue to be a procurement method available to the State for appropriately structured projects where they demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware I established an Inter-Departmental\/Inter-Agency Group last year to review Ireland's experience of using PPP and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.

On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service, so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  While certain aspects of the new approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.  I firmly believe that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.  <\/p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity as may be agreed during the consultation process.  Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them.  I might add that an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is expected shortly.  This report will help with the further development of the Call for Proposals documentation. <\/p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals). GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified.  For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them.  That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services.  Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate a certain proportion of secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives.  I can assure Deputies that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the approach in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued, including in relation to the matters referred to by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.  I can assure Deputies that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new GYDP model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200042#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200042#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[13264\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200042#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 155 of 15 February 2018, the number of garda&iacute; in respect of all other counties by division, district and rank; the number of Garda vehicles based full time in counties by vehicle type, division and or district; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also a further 600 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the remainder of the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

However, the latter mechanism did not deliver the numbers envisaged and the Government has chosen to fill the gap by making additional pledges for programme refugees and through a new\u00a0 Family Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the IRPP for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and\u00a0local level.\u00a0\u00a0Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE and Tusla\u00a0are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.\u00a0 In general, coordination is ensured via the IRPP secretariat\u00a0which is part of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) within my Department.  OPMI are the primary entity responsible for delivering resettlement via a range of statutory and non-statutory agencies.  They have overseen the humanitarian resettlement programmes run by Ireland since they were established in 2000.\u00a0 The Reception and Integration Agency, working closely with OPMI,\u00a0is also responsible for contracting accommodation in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.<\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Office based within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) also play a prominent role\u00a0 in this area as they independently determine applications for international protection that are made by asylum seekers arriving in Ireland\u00a0through the EU relocation mechanism.  Staff of that office also serve as liaison officers in Greece and Italy, as required, working closely with national authorities and international organisations based in those states and providing orientation services on resettlement missions in Greece.\u00a0\u00a0Staff of the OPMI also work on\u00a0temporary assignments overseas in Greece and Lebanon to interview applicants for resettlement together with members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other state agencies as required.<\/p>  <p>  In general, I have responsibility for agencies falling within my own Department but as the resettlement process is mainstreamed other Ministers and other actors also have specific responsibilities, both statutory and non-statutory.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is mobilising European Union Funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) in support of Ireland's resettlement efforts.\u00a0 Local Authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through the implementation of a process carried out by an \"implementing partner\" with expertise in community integration and relevant supports, supported by funding provided through\u00a0OPMI and AMIF.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Irish Red Cross, who alongside UNHCR, are represented on the national IRPP Taskforce and who are one of our key partners.  The Government assigned the Irish Red Cross responsibility for administering public pledges of support, especially in the area of accommodation, and their case workers and support team work closely with IRPP and refugees to find suitable accommodation options.\u00a0 IRPP has a memorandum of understanding with the Red Cross in relation to their role.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of practices and procedures, I set out below in general terms some of the key practices and procedures that are relevant to\u00a0persons arriving under the Programme\u00a0that are delivered by a range of\u00a0bodies working to deliver the programme:<\/p>  <p>  - Programme refugees\u00a0and asylum seekers eligible under the IRPP are interviewed abroad by Department officials to assess their needs and vulnerabilities and\u00a0to initially orient them to Irish life and society.\u00a0 Members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also accompany those mission and interview applicants from a security perspective.<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP staff\u00a0and interpreters meet families and individuals upon arrival and accompany them to their initial\u00a0accommodation in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).\u00a0 As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country.  In the EROCs both cohorts\u00a0receive broadly the same integration services with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection.\u00a0 IRPP staff hold regular clinics in the EROCs, often at weekly intervals,\u00a0at which\u00a0individuals and families may discuss their\u00a0needs and requirements.  The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.<\/p>  <p>  - During the\u00a0days following arrival in Ireland, and after initial assessment and registration with the IPO,\u00a0the asylum seekers arriving under relocation are registered\u00a0with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for a public services card and\u00a0receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).\u00a0\u00a0They are also assisted with registration with INIS.<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP\u00a0officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals\u00a0receive a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP\u00a0liaise with the Department of Education and Skills and the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area\u00a0to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation\u00a0programme and to facilitate access to education. Education provision is ensured for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - Local\u00a0Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the EROCs to provide services and\u00a0information and to\u00a0support and befriend the asylum seekers or refugees.<\/p>  <p>  - A GP is assigned to the individuals and families\u00a0to ensure that their immediate medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services.<\/p>  <p>  - Free\u00a0Childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the\u00a0Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.<\/p>  <p>  - Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.<\/p>  <p>  - When housing is made available with the support of the Local Authority, the\u00a0refugees will be resettled in the community with the support of the\u00a0IRPP\u00a0and volunteers in the local community.  Each family\u00a0has the support of an\u00a0assigned IRPP resettlement worker to assist with the\u00a0transition along with the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural Support Worker employed by the implementing partner under the auspices of the local authority.  Local authorities also receive some\u00a0funding to provide for certain exceptional needs such counselling, transport and other supports.<\/p>  <p>  - When housing or accommodation is made available in an area through the Red Cross they provide an appropriate level of support to the refugees or, if possible,\u00a0the refugees may be transitioned into the support programme run by the \"implementing partner\" under the auspices of the local authority if this opportunity exists in the relevant area.<\/p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model uses the\u00a0existing best practice model in this area as pioneered by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration\u00a0(OPMI) for refugee resettlement but it is also sufficiently flexible\u00a0to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to assist and facilitate refugees.<\/p>  <p>  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives and it is for this reason I am examining initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[13440\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the Acts under which city and county sheriffs derive their powers of seizure or repossession; and his plans to codify those powers in single legislation.","asker":"1305","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 sets out the functions and powers of the Sheriff.\u00a0 Section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945 relates to the appointment of the Sheriff.<\/p><p>I should add that section 133 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 abolished the sheriff&rsquo;s powers to seize a tenancy under a writ of fieri facias or other process of execution except in relation to a tenancy of land that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business. \u00a0<\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that while\u00a0I have\u00a0no plans at present to consolidate the powers\u00a0I will be keeping the matter under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":259,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[13471\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a decision has been taken on the location of the new court in north County Kildare;\u00a0if there is a timeframe for its delivery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that it is currently concentrating on the development or refurbishment of courthouses at provincial city\/county town venues.

In addition, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services. <\/p>  <p>  Careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the Call for Proposals in advance of it being issued.<\/p>  <p>  As indicated above, the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services to current participants. It is of course a matter for organisations which apply to provide future GYDP services under the Call for Proposals to ensure that they comply with relevant legal responsibilities, including in relation to the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131\/2003).<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I might add that while my Department does provide funding, through the Irish Youth Justice Service, for the operation of over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, it is not the employer of the youth justice workers on these projects and has no human resources or industrial relations function in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":267,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 104 and 105 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH01900"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[13511\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200043#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to introduce a scheme similar to the enterprise stabilisation fund that was introduced in 2009 to assist businesses facing difficulties due to Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>The Department has undertaken significant research and consultation to better understand the challenges posed by Brexit for businesses in Ireland, and based on this work has designed a suite of supports for impacted businesses.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the\u00a0health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the\u00a0localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population.<\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication.<\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes.<\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.\u00a0 If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient. \u00a0The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 16 March 2018, there have been 5,504 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis.  Of these applications, 1,059 patients (over 19%) have been approved.<\/p><p>Some 526 online appeals have been made, and over 69% of these patients have been approved.  The MMP has sought further information on 38 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.<\/p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,421 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.<\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies.  This advice has been re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. <\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This reimbursement\u00a0decision is a matter for the HSE.

In preparing the study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the City Centre, and the report noted that as the economy continues its recovery and employment rises, without positive intervention, increased congestion and longer journey times on the key routes to Dublin City, and within the City Centre itself, will become an increasing feature of the City.  The report also acknowledged that with the introduction of the Luas Cross City Project, Luas trams would be caught up in traffic congestion, and that the service reliability would be prone to disruption due to general traffic.  Similarly the report also acknowledged the impact to the reliability of the bus network given the interaction with other road traffic.  The report recognised that a rebalancing of the available road space will be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking.  Significant changes to the traffic network in the City Centre will be necessary, with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  <\/p>  <p>  NTA and DCC, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  As the Deputy is aware, the City Council's College Green Plaza proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination, and if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, as Minister for Transport I have ensured that Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021.  The 4 year envelope will allocate investment fund projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, will continue investment in Dublin's light rail network, cycling and walking and traffic management measures in our capital and beyond.

The design and layout of each application form must also have regard to the particular requirements of the individual scheme or payment and ensure that the form captures all of the information required to assess and process the application.  The content and layout of application forms is reviewed regularly to ensure they are kept up-to-date and that they comply with our plain English principles.<\/p><p>The Carer&rsquo;s form has recently been redesigned.  This new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  The Changes to the form have been finalised following consultation with Family Carers Ireland and carers representatives.<\/p><p>Whilst no specific training is proposed for carers to assist them in completing application forms, my Department provides a range of supports to assist carers, and other customers who may require further information or experience difficulties in filling out a form.<\/p><p>First, the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i>, is the central repository of information on all of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.

In order to further improve accessibility of information and services for all customers, my Department will continue to explore additional channels of communication, including the use of video content, where appropriate.<\/p><p>The Department also operates a nationwide network of Intreo centres and branch offices.  In larger offices there is staff dedicated to providing information and explaining the Department's schemes and services available, and to provide assistance to customers to enable them to access their full entitlements or indeed help those who need assistance in filling in a form.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the national network of Citizen Information Services also provides key advice, information and assistance to customers seeking such on my Department&rsquo;s schemes or indeed who need assistance in filling in a form.<\/p><p>In addition, regular formal information sessions for customer representative groups, are used as a means of communicating new information on schemes, as well as providing an opportunity to consult and receive feedback on proposed announcements, changes and communication strategies.  This is an important source of customer feedback and an opportunity for a variety of customer groups and representatives to engage with us.<\/p><p>In line with my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that members of the general public are fully aware of the welfare supports and services available to them, the Department run various external information campaigns to increase general public awareness of the schemes and services available.  Advertising is targeted appropriately through the best mix of media to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s messages reach the target customers.

These include activation supports such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s and Local Employment Services (LES).<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  There has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed in the five years since the end December 2012.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. <\/p><p>Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.<\/p><p>Following the publication of my Department&rsquo;s Report, <i>An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme<\/i>, in April 2017 the Government approved a number of changes to the terms and conditions around participation on CE.  These changes were implemented from 3 July 2017.  The main purpose of these changes was to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people who can take part - including reducing the entry age to 21 - giving a second opportunity to people who have already taken part, and securing the number of places at existing levels.  Overall, these changes improve the way that CE operates and should allow access to more people who are long-term unemployed.  If any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local Intreo Centre for assistance.<\/p><p>T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative introduced during 2011, was set up to provide short-term, work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  This initiative is being delivered through the network of 47 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Recent changes have also been implemented to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the numbers available for this scheme.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. <\/p><p>In 2018, the Department has contracted for the provision of LES in 26 locations with 22 contractors through a network of offices and outreach clinics.  The funding and total value of these contracts for the provision of the services has been continually maintained over the years, both through periods of economic downturn and in more recent years where again we have seen a welcome reduction in the unemployment rate.  The increased capacity provided through Intreo and JobPath and the reduction of the live register means the LES can now focus on offering an enhanced service to jobseekers.

This sub-group is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>Persons granted international protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) can access State provided supports and services on the same basis as Irish nationals.<\/p><p>Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.  This includes determining whether it is appropriate to refer a household for Homeless HAP Place Finder services. <\/p><p>The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.  The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017. <\/p><p>In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation, since January 2018, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service has been made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. <\/p><p>To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, the Irish Red Cross (IRC) has been mandated by the Department of Justice and Equality to assist with the delivery and provision of accommodation and integration supports under the IRPP.  In Autumn 2015, the Irish Red Cross was tasked by Government with managing voluntary pledges of accommodation, goods and services from the Irish public.  This includes the IRC deploying migration volunteer coordinators across the country in county hubs including through IRC branches and volunteer members.  The IRC is working together with each of the local authorities to coordinate the local responses. <\/p><p>There are a number of ways in which a programme refugee might have their housing need met under HAP: in private rental accommodation with HAP support from Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, with assistance of IRC or other non-governmental agencies; in private rental accommodation with HAP support from Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, by sourcing their own accommodation; or in a pledged property using HAP support, under the normal conditions of the HAP scheme. <\/p><p>In summary, arrangements are in place at local authority level across the country to support the identification of units and housing for programme refugees, including through HAP.  In addition to the availability of Homeless HAP in situations where the local authority determines the household as homeless, the additional co-ordination measures outlined above are intended to support and assist families into suitable accommodation for their needs. <\/p><p>Such housing solutions are being funded from the &euro;6 billion approved by Government under Rebuilding Ireland over the period 2016-2021.  It should be noted that a range of other supports are also being made available at local level to support the integration of the families concerned into their new communities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200060#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Ownership","counter":821,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200061#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":822,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[13485\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200061#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if an interested party can establish the identity of the owner of a residential property to raise an issue affecting the interested party; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":823,"content":"<p>While my\u00a0Department does not\u00a0hold the data referred to in the question, the\u00a0Property Registration Authority\u00a0records the names and addresses of every registered land\u00a0owner.

This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.  Under the 2009 Act, a household is defined as a person living alone, or two or more persons, who in the opinion of the local authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.<\/p><p>As such, it is a matter for each local authority to decide on the type of support to be allocated to individual households.  As Minister, I am precluded by the 2009 Act from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in the allocation of particular dwellings.<\/p><p>In addition to traditional local authority housing, social housing support is also provided through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. Under HAP, local authorities will make a monthly payment to a landlord, subject to terms and conditions including rent limits, on a HAP tenant&rsquo;s behalf.  In return, the HAP tenant pays a weekly contribution towards the rent to the local authority.  This &lsquo;rent contribution&rsquo; is based on the household income.  It is calculated in the same way as the rent paid by a tenant of a local authority owned property.<\/p><p>HAP provides fast, flexible housing support to households in an area of their choice. Individuals with a housing need who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.  There are currently more than 34,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP.<\/p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, I have made it clear to local authorities that the delivery of social housing supports must be focussed on and consistent with housing need as measured by the now annual Summary of Social Housing Assessment (SSHA) process.  Given that the largest percentage of households in need of support are now single person households, this clearly means that the provision of one and two-bedroom dwellings has to be increased in many locations in the coming periods.  My Department is working actively with local authorities to increase these types of dwellings and the recently published guidelines for apartments will also help in this regard.<\/p><p>The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and significant progress is being made.  This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published in January 2018, showing that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the targets set under Rebuilding Ireland were carefully set against the reality of deliverables.  Of the overall target of meeting the needs of 137,000 households by 2021, just under 45,000 households have had their social housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Plan, some 33% of those targeted.
