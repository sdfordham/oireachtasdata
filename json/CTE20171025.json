This committee will have a critically important role to play in the development of budgets in the years ahead.  We will give an overall assessment of the budget and consider equality budgeting and how it might apply.<\/p> <p>  The budget sees modest improvements for some but fails to get to grips with the scale of the series of crises that need to be addressed.  Ireland faces several persistent challenges.  There are over 8,000 people, of whom 3,000 are children, without a home.  Over 213,000 children, or nearly one in five, are at risk of poverty.  One in three children is experiencing deprivation, while 128,000 are living in consistent poverty.  Over 90,000 households are on housing waiting lists.  There is also the two-tier health care system and the growing divide between those living in urban and rural areas.  These are just some of the challenges.  Everybody present could have a list of the serious challenges we face.  While the budget shows some modest improvements, there is no sense that we are getting to grips with these challenges. <\/p> <p>  The tax changes could have been fairer.

We show that with very slightly less money than the Government spent on tax cuts, a much fairer approach could have been taken.  Two things could have been done instead with the same money.  First, income tax credits could have been made refundable, meaning that all the benefit would go to people in low-pay work and deal with the issue of poverty in work or the working poor issue.  Second, there would be enough money to give &euro;100 in refundable tax credits to every person who has a job, meaning, in effect, that everyone would get &euro;100, couples would be &euro;200 a year better off and the low-paid and the working poor would get slightly more.  That is a much fairer outcome of the distribution and, in fact, there would be a small surplus left over for any other issues needing to be covered if this were done.  That is just one example of what we mean when we say tax changes could be much fairer.  These things could have been done and we spell them out in our analysis and critique.  I will tie this back into equality budgeting.<\/p> <p>  The low total tax take is not sustainable in the long run.  If we want to maintain existing levels of services in a situation in which the population is growing and ageing, we will not be able to provide those levels of service without additional taxation; therefore, that issue needs to be considered.  We suggest the issue of corporate tax contributions, for example, be examined much more closely.  We have proposed, for example, a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 6% - in other words, that corporations would have to pay at least 6% and that they would not be able to take the rate below that with whatever tax breaks they get.  This would still leave the Government with plenty of space between the 12.5% rate and the 6% rate to encourage people to do research and development, move to the west or do whatever else.<\/p> <p>  We also wished to highlight that greater public investment was required.  Ireland has one of the lowest levels of public investment in the European Union, which we find quite scary because of the long-run implications of such a low level of public investment.  While the resources available in the budget for redistribution were relatively small, the Government did not spend them all on the investment side; as I said, it devoted close to a third of them to reducing taxation.  We need to think laterally about how this is done.  We have made suggestions as to how there could be a substantial increase in the investment in social housing, for example, while keeping it off the Government's books at the same time in order that there would not be problems with the fiscal measures from Brussels.<\/p> <p>  The next issue we wanted to highlight was transparency.  We have a serious concern that the budget document supplied by the Government raised some questions about transparency.  For example, we do not believe the information and backup figures for the health care budget are really transparent.  I will spell this out.  Outstanding expenditure of approximately &euro;100 million is being carried forward but we cannot see where the provision for that is in the budget for 2018.  It seems to us that there is an overhang of &euro;100 million, an overspend in 2017 being carried into 2018, which, because it will be last year's money when 2018 comes, will become the first charge next year.  Then, to maintain that level of service, that &euro;100 million will become a bill again, and we cannot see this in the budget numbers.  The second issue that causes us problems in that regard is that we do not believe the provision for pay increases in health is adequate.  When one thinks about a sector that has 100,000 employees and the allocation that is in the books, it seems to us that quite a substantial component of the pay increase is not actually provided for in the health budget, which means, in effect, that as the pay increases are already agreed, it therefore means there must be cuts somewhere else if the budget is to balance in 2018, and we do not see this.  Third, while we welcome the announcement of new initiatives and increased overall expenditure on health, it does not seem to us to be possible to maintain the existing level of service and at the same time implement all the new health care initiatives in the budget.  There is an issue about the transparency of the budget numbers and we have drawn attention to it in previous years.  This is a critically important issue for Deputies and Senators because ultimately it is the Members of the Oireachtas who vote on the budget and make the choices and so on.<\/p> <p>  The issue of budget proofing is hugely important and needs to be addressed.  There has been a devastating impact on a lot of people in the past ten years as a result of the crash and all the various things that have flowed from it.  We do not think budget 2018 has taken any significant initiative to measure whether, for example, poverty and inequality will fall or rise as a result of the budget's overall impact.  We are happy to see a paper on how to proceed on equality budgeting, and it is very strong on one dimension of equality budgeting and equality proofing, that is, the issue of gender.  That is very important and budget proofing from a gender perspective is critically important and absolutely must be done.  However, it is not the only dimension.  In the paper prepared by the Department and published on the day of the budget, only in the last third does the issue of distribution arise in any serious way, and it seems to us that this is a critically important issue.  I will come back to what the key headings should be in terms of budget proofing.  We argue and believe very strongly that budget proofing should be an integral part of all future budgets in Ireland.  We also think this committee has a serious role to play in ensuring budget proofing is part of the process.  Much work could be done to back up this committee.  Much work also could be done in advance, that is, before the budget also.<\/p> <p>  As for ensuring a good future for the country that produces well-being for everyone, we set out in our opening statement a table with five columns.  The opening statement has been supplied to the committee.  We are saying that in a policy framework for a just Ireland, there are five things - members can see them across the top of the table - that people and the Government should be working for: to build a vibrant economy, to have decent services and infrastructure, to have just taxation, to have good governance and to be sustainable in whatever we do.  I think there would be fairly strong or widespread agreement across these headings.  The challenge is to work out how they are operationalised and so on.  We suggest, in terms of policy proofing the budget, that these five areas need to be proofed.  What does this mean in practice?  One of the things that should be measured in respect of the vibrant economy, for example, is whether there has been adequate public investment, given the scale of the situation in any year or what is being planned over a period.  Furthermore, there is the importance, when one is equality proofing a budget, of ensuring that the choices made promote fiscal and financial stability.  We need sustainable economic growth.  That is one element.  The second element is proofing the services and the infrastructure to ensure, for example, that the services are becoming less two-tier if they are already two-tier, that they are not moving in the wrong direction and that the infrastructure is being provided not only to maintain the existing level of service but also to improve it.<\/p><p> With regard to just taxation, we need increased equity in taxation and reduced income inequality.  There is solid scope for equality proofing in the budget.  <\/p><p> The next issue is good governance.  What we are speaking about here is a measure of whether the budget is a participative process.  At one level the budget is, of course, the document produced by the Government because it is the Government's view of the priorities and, given the resources available, what it will do.  What we would say is that it is important to involve the various sectors of society in the process of working out the best options.  The reason for this is that the various sectors have different experiences of the realities in which we live and of the policies as implemented and it is important to bring this experience to the table, together with possible ideas, suggestions and proposals worked out about how these issues could be resolved.<\/p><p> We believe the issue of sustainability is critical for equality proofing.  An example of what we would be looking at here is whether the changes and initiatives in the budget promote balanced regional development.  To help with this, we have been arguing for quite a while that we need to go beyond our current toolkit that measures whether we are making progress, which is measured by GDP and one or two other things, to a much more nuanced approach that would, perhaps, include a lot of other indicators.  There are examples of this in other countries, where they have shadow national accounts.  They keep the national accounts exactly as they are kept everywhere, but they have another set which is more nuanced.  For example, this set adds in the value of unpaid work or takes out the use of raw materials that cannot be replaced.<\/p><p> Drafting a budget involves major decision-making about the direction of society and how available resources can best be used to address the challenges being faced by society, while moving towards a desirable and just future.  Equality proofing is central to this.  I absolutely agree the work on gender proofing that has already begun should be continued, but we strongly urge a much wider approach to cover the types of issues we have set out in order that we get a comprehensive proofing of the budget to ensure it works to build a vibrant economy and well-being for all in a sustainable way, with everybody participating in shaping the decisions that are being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508936400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>In his statement Dr. Healy suggested there is very little in the budget in terms of public investment.

We have the M7 motorway, the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick and the national indoor arena in Blanchardstown.

We can provide hard copies for anyone who is interested in having one.  We acknowledge fully the increase in public investment in the budget generally.  We also acknowledge the increase in expenditure in the overall budget.  However, what we are saying is Ireland has a very low level of public investment compared to other European countries.  We have one of the lowest, particularly when we think about our peers in the EU15, and not counting Lithuania, Bulgaria and such places.  If we look at the EU15, we have a much lower level of public investment annually and we are very concerned about this.  We have been concerned about it for several years.  We did a briefing some years ago, which showed that at that point we had the lowest level of public investment.  What worried us - we pointed it out at the time - was not that we had the lowest, which was bad enough, but that if we doubled our investment at that time we would still have had the lowest level of investment in the European Union.  We are very concerned that if we do not put in the investment now, we will store up problems for ourselves down the line.  We fully acknowledge that we must stay within fiscal parameters, although we suggest they should be renegotiated and we have suggested ways of doing this.  We also suggest there are ways of having special purpose vehicles for dealing with housing, and social housing in particular, because we consider it to be a one-off expenditure that urgently needs to be done.  We believe agreement could be got for this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Department of Health, what we are speaking about is straightforward enough.  The first issue has to do with the overrun.

We listened to the press conferences and read the press releases and all of the documentation.  We cannot find any evidence it is being dealt with.  <\/p> <p>  The second issue is our reading of the provision for pay increases, which seems to be too low.

The health budget needs serious re-doing and it will take a number of years to do it.  It needs to be more integrated than it is.  It was close enough to that a number of years ago.  There was a time when primary care, community care and the hospitals were together in different areas in the different regions.  This was under the HSE.  However, then a Government decided that hospitals would be split away.  From that moment on, there was a problem, which is recognised in the budget and the Minister's statement, as the Government is looking now to set up another body to examine how to integrate the hospitals back into the health system.  A number of years have been lost because the original break of the two of those should not have happened.  However, that is the past.  In the future there is a need for integration of the whole system and primary care and community care need to be the cornerstone.  We would have primary care centres and health groupings at local level.  These would be the starting point rather than hospitals and acute services.  There is value in such an approach.  For instance, were we to do better on home care packages and so on, that costs far less and older people want to live at home rather than be in hospitals or nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017102500002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1508936400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I agree.

Consequently, an increase in the tax-take is a question of how, rather than if, and we believe it should be of a scale appropriate to maintain current public service provisions while providing the resources to build a better society.<\/blockquote> <p>I will dig into this further.<\/p><p>Are we talking about the actual amount of tax that is collected or the percentage of tax that is collected because while there can be tax cuts, because more people are in employment and wages are increasing, the amount of taxation increases?<\/p><p> Given what we are looking at in the next three years, as part of the confidence and supply arrangement with Fianna F&aacute;il we are likely to see about &euro;3 billion of tax cuts of the &euro;10 billion in fiscal space that would be available over the three years.  What is the view of Social Justice Ireland in that regard?  We always hear that this is the biggest budget allocation ever to education or health.  This is nonsensical and stupid commentary because there are more children in school and people who need health services.  Of course, wages are increasing.  If we tracked it from 1920, the budgets would have gone up every year other than during the austerity years.  Can the delegates reference it?  How does that sit with the fact that we are likely to see significant decreases in tax under the current trajectory or strategy of the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017102500002#L01000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508936400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We are looking for an increase in the overall tax take as a percentage of GDP.  In our budget choices document and socioeconomic review, we argue that we need a 1% percentage point increase each year between now and 2020 just to begin to bridge the gap.  We are still under the threshold for what the European Union defines as a low-tax economy, but we need to start bringing in those kind of funds to provide the school places that will be required for those children who will be looking for them and the commensurate higher or further education places.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the increased number of older people we will have in the country, it is not just a health but a care service issue and if there are more older people with more acquired disability, how does our disability strategy run from young to old and how do we ensure a continuum of care?  We make a number of proposals in terms of how we would increase the overall tax take.  It cannot just be focused on income tax.  A significant amount can be done with reform but we would say that the minimum starting point is a 1% percentage point increase each year between now and 2020 if we are going to deliver the services people require, such as the current level of service in health but also the new and welcome initiatives that were announced.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that the health and education budgets in particular will have to increase in the coming years no matter what way one looks at it.  This is without introducing any new initiative at all but just to provide an existing level of service.  Dealing with the higher education funding issue is a huge challenge and we need to look at how that will be funded.  In health, it involves providing the services people will need in the areas in which they live.  As we have the census data, we know where people are living.  Older people will not migrate to more urban centres.  How are we going to provide them with home care packages and social care in their areas in which they live?  That money needs to be put in place now.  Those services might not be needed for another five or six years but the infrastructure needs to be put in now.  That requires more funding.  Overall, it must be an overall increase in the tax take as a percentage of GDP as opposed to just the amount of revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017102500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1508936400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>If tax increases were introduced in other areas, does Ms Murphy think there is sufficient scope for personal income decreases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017102500002#M00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508936400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>We have never been in favour of personal income tax decreases.

It is one of the few taxes we have in this country that is incredibly difficult to avoid and it is progressive because the more someone earns, the more USC they pay.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's modernisation and renewal programme 2016-2021 represents the first time the organisation has laid out its mission, direction, plans and challenges spanning a five-year period.  The fact criminal activity changes and extends into new areas at a pace and that we have to react quickly and flexibly to cope with developments is stated in the document.  In this regard, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently made major changes in response to organised crime and security threats, and has new strategies to address other emerging crimes and security challenges.  In particular, online child sexual exploitation is a constantly evolving phenomenon and is shaped by developments in technology, mobile connectivity, growing Internet coverage in developing countries and the development of pay-as-you-go streaming solutions, which provide a high degree of anonymity to the viewer and are furthering the trend in commercial live-streaming of child sexual abuse.  Thus, it is necessary for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it enhances its capacity to tackle the criminality involved, while being particularly alert to the vulnerability of its potential victims.<\/p> <p>  To a significant extent, responsibility for personal online security and protection rests with the user.  However, as users get younger and are not as likely to be alert to cybercrime, especially in circumstances where the age of digital consent is to be lowered to 13 years, personal responsibility must also be supported by parents, teachers and responsible entities, including State agencies, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The issues surrounding unrestricted access to WiFi are well publicised.  Controls which existed at an earlier time in circumstances where children accessed the Internet at home or elsewhere under some form of supervision have been eroded by the prevalence of Internet cafes and mobile technology.  It is now possible that a very young child can use a mobile phone to access the Internet over available public WiFi networks and can search for or come upon pornographic or violent material with little or no parental control.  Increasingly children are engaging in the sharing of self-taken imagery where they send nude and-or sexually explicit personal photographs of each other to other members of a chat group, utilising platforms such as WhatsApp or Instagram or other social media such as Facebook or Snapchat.  While this scenario has given rise to a form of bullying, there is an added danger when images are circulated outside the confines of friends or otherwise become available to third parties, who may then use them as a trap to engage with a child or set up fake profiles, using the images as bait.<\/p> <p>  The modernisation and renewal programme sets out clearly that victims of crime will be put at the heart of the service provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2015, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established 28 victim service offices across the country which are tasked with communicating with victims of crime and prioritising their needs.  Protective services units, PSUs, which will operate within each Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division, will assist in ensuring that relevant child protection, domestic and sexual violence incidents are thoroughly investigated and victims fully supported.  In 2015, through the creation of the Garda national protective services bureau, GNPSB, a number of units operating in various locations throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against vulnerable people.  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and that such investigations are handled in an appropriate manner.  In addition, this bureau is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  Among the specialist units now located within the Garda national protective services bureau, GNPSB, are sex crime management unit; online child exploitation unit; national child protection unit; sex offender management and intelligence unit; and the national SORAM office, which is a multi-agency office staffed by a members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Child and Family agency and a representative from Dublin City Council housing section to manage sex offenders.  Other units include the human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit; the national victims office; and the missing persons unit.<\/p> <p>  Within the online child exploitation unit at the GNPSB a new unit has been created which is tasked with the identification of online victims of exploitation.  Personnel attached to the GNPSB have received training to enable them to perform the role of specialist victim interviewers, particularly relating to children.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are often the first people victims of crime make contact with after a crime has been committed.<\/p><p>Victims of crime will often have had a traumatic and potentially life-changing experience and may be vulnerable and require help and support.  However, while getting the first contact with a victim right is critical, so too is ensuring this care and attention continues as their case, which is incredibly important and personal to them, moves through the justice system.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely aware of the emotional and physical suffering of victims of child abuse and the fact their experience may make it very difficult for them to report the crimes they have suffered.  They may also feel that their complaint will not be taken seriously or fully investigated.<br\/><br\/>The online child sexual exploitation unit, OnCE, at the Garda national protective services bureau has responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Acts 1998 to 2004 as well as the investigation and co-ordination of cases relating to the possession, distribution and production of child pornography and any related sexual abuse of children.  The unit is also responsible for the proactive investigation of intelligence concerning paedophiles and their use of technology and the online targeting of suspects for the production, distribution, and possession of child abuse images on the Internet.  New strategies have been developed to meet the ever-increasing challenges of cybersecurity and cybercrime.  The modernisation and renewal programme sets out the intention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to expand its capabilities with regard to cybercrime through training with academic partners, increased investment in technology and people and regionalisation of the investigation of computer crime, which for many years was located within the Garda national economic crime bureau.<br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will establish a new national cybersecurity desk, NCSD, located at its crime and security section at Garda headquarters.  It will liaise with national and international stakeholders, including the Europol national unit, ENU, Interpol national central bureau, NCB, police partners and security organisations such as the Europol EC3 unit, the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA, and Interpol.<br\/><br\/>It is also planned to establish a telecommunications and information technology security operations centre.  This centre will include two separate dedicated units to deal with anomalies in information systems networks and provide cyber and forensic tools and infrastructure to support operational policing and State security activities.<br\/><br\/>The Garda national cybercrime bureau, GCCB, was established in September 2016, providing an enhanced structure within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of tackling cybercrime.  The bureau has a national remit with regard to the phenomenon of cybercrime and in particular the investigation of online criminality.  This bureau is tasked with undertaking the forensic examination of computer media in all incidents reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Furthermore, this bureau is given a role with regard to the provision of crime prevention advice to the public and the corporate sector regarding online offending and e-safety.  This includes the provision of Internet safety advice.<br\/><br\/>Regional cybercrime investigation units, CCIU, are being established and such units are operating successfully on a pilot basis in New Ross, County Wexford and Ballincollig, County Cork.  The regional units will provide computer forensic services locally under the supervision of the national bureau.  With a view to further supporting the regional units, it is planned to develop and roll out first responder and triage capability nationally.  These first responders will support the regional units and provide for a tiered level of capability nationally, with the Garda national cybercrime bureau as the top tier of support and capability.<br\/><br\/>The Garda cybercrime bureau, in conjunction with the Garda College, has developed a training module in the investigation of cybercrime for delivery to all students in the Garda College in Templemore.  It is planned that other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be trained in cybercrime awareness and cybercrime investigation through our continuing professional development network.<br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will further its long-standing relationship with the centre for cybersecurity and cybercrime investigation at University College Dublin through the Garda computer crime investigation unit and alumni who have undertaken courses of study at the university in the cyber domain.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also develop more educational partnerships with third level institutions and international institutions with expertise in cybersecurity to ensure the availability of cutting-edge knowledge throughout the organisation.  We will look for opportunities to develop relationships and share expertise further.<br\/><br\/>In November 2017, personnel attached to the Garda cybercrime bureau will travel to Lyon, France to participate in specialist victim identification training relating to crimes against children, which training is being delivered at Interpol headquarters.  This course will address the issue of the vulnerability of children arising from the availability of child exploitative material on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>Any adult, child, business or organisation using a connected device is vulnerable to cybercrime.  Just as with offline crime, simple steps can often be effective in reducing the recognised vulnerabilities.  Working in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders, the Garda cybercrime bureau will use the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s communication channels, &quot;Crimecall&quot;, and public awareness campaigns to ensure that people are educated on protecting themselves from cybercrime.  We intend to develop further our crime prevention activities in this area.<br\/><br\/>While it is not feasible to regulate or monitor the Internet in anticipation of all possible incidents such as cyberbullying, if a member of the public becomes aware of activity on the Internet which they suspect may be illegal, they can report it confidentially to <i>hotline.ie<\/i>.  This is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland with oversight by the Office for Internet Safety, OIS, in the Department of Justice and Equality.  <i>Hotline.ie<\/i>provides the public with the means to report illegal online content such as child sexual abuse material and liaises with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have illegal content taken down.<br\/><br\/>The Office for Internet Safety, OIS, is responsible for developing strategic actions to promote the highest possible levels of Internet safety, particularly in combating child pornography.  A dedicated website, <i>www.internetsafety.ie<\/i>, is supported by the OIS and provides information and links to other resources on Internet safety.  In addition, it partners with experts to develop and publish a series of information booklets on Internet safety which are made available on the website and in hard copy.<br\/><br\/>In November 2014, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an initiative on the blocking of child sexual abuse material, CSAM, on the Internet in Ireland.  The OIS has an oversight role in the operation of <i>hotline.ie<\/i>and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na blocking initiative.  <i>Hotline.ie<\/i>is the confidential service for reporting illegal content on the Internet in Ireland and liaises closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out this function.<br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signed a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with one large Internet service provider under which the service provider agreed to block access to CSAM based on information which we provide to it.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to engage with other service providers with a view to establishing further MOUs.<br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides crime prevention advice to the public and the corporate sector regarding online offending and e-safety.  This includes the provision of Internet safety advice to schools, third level institutions through, for example, the Campus Watch programme, and the public, through media releases such as the recent pan-European mobile malware awareness campaign, and through regular information releases in the national publications and the &quot;Crimecall&quot; programme.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, obliges Internet service providers, ISPs, to retain data for one year.  However, there is no penalty for a failure to retain such data.  Section 7 of that Act requires ISPs to comply with a disclosure request made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursuant to section 6 of that Act.  However, if Internet providers fail to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with data pursuant to the Act, our ability to identify people involved in the sexual exploitation of children or the distribution of child pornography on the Internet will be restricted.<br\/><br\/>The investigation of all relevant incidents and the examination of associated computer media is dependent on the disclosure of a criminal offence.  In cases involving the online safety of our young people, the primary offences are cyberbullying and sexual exploitation.  In this regard, the relevant legislative provisions are contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.<br\/><br\/>Lockers is a new information and education resource designed, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to assist schools in coping with and preventing the sharing of explicit self-generated images of minors.<\/p><p>Intended for use within the junior cycle social personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, Lockers is supported by a newly developed animation and six lesson plans and includes an information section for school leaders.  This 25 page section informs principals on the context for sexting among young people, the laws that can come into effect when underage sexting occurs and the implications for school policy.<\/p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in the development of a new Webwise campaign, provisionally entitled Exposed, for delivery through secondary schools as a follow on from Lockers.  This new campaign will be designed to address the issue of the sexual exploitation of children through the use of technology and will incorporate the \"Say No!\" campaign launched earlier this year by Europol with the support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The \"Say No!\" campaign, including a ten minute video clip, was launched to advise the public on sextortion, the threatened release of self-generated sexual images or information to extort money or to coerce a person to provide more images, engage in sexual activity, or to do something they otherwise would not do.<\/p><p> In 2010, the European Union set up a four-year policy cycle in order to create a greater measure of continuity for the fight against serious international and organised crime.  The policy calls for effective co-operation among law enforcement agencies, other EU agencies, EU institutions and relevant third parties.  The EU initiative gave rise to the European multidisciplinary platform against criminal threats, EMPACT.  Europol has identified nine priority crime areas.  For each one, a multi-annual strategic plan, an EMPACT project and an operational action plan are implemented.  As a form of cybercrime, child sexual exploitation is one of the nine EMPACT priorities in Europol's priority crime areas under the 2013-2017 EU policy.<\/p><p> Europol's European cybercrime centre, known as EC3, supports the competent authorities in member states in preventing and detecting all forms of criminality associated with the sexual exploitation of children.  The head of EC3, Stephen Wilson, spent the past few days with us in Dublin.  It provides assistance and expertise in combatting the distribution of child abuse material through all kinds of online environments and tackles all forms of criminal online behaviour against children, such as grooming, self-generated indecent material, sexual extortion and live streaming on the web.<\/p><p> Fighting the distribution of child abuse material includes preventing and intercepting it and stopping it from being shared through peer-to-peer networks as well as through commercial platforms.  In this regard, EC3 is involved in the European financial coalition against commercial sexual exploitation of children online, EFC, a network funded by the European Commission composed of law enforcement, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and public and private sector stakeholders.<\/p><p> EC3 is also involved in the virtual global taskforce, VGT, a collaborative partnership of law enforcement agencies, which have come together across the digital divide to combat online child sexual abuse worldwide.  The \"report abuse\" button on the VGT website is an effective way to report suspicious online behaviour.<\/p><p> Co-operation at an international level has proved very effective in identifying victims of child sexual abuse and exploitation.  In 2015 Europol hosted a victim identification taskforce, which resulted in 240 new collections of material being uploaded to Interpol's child sexual exploitation image database and the extension of the existing 100 collections.<\/p><p> In addition, Europol's project, halting Europeans abusing victims in every nation, HAVEN, supports EU member states in detecting and intercepting child sexual offenders travelling abroad to abuse children.  The violent crimes against children international task force, VCACITF, is a select cadre of international law enforcement experts working together to formulate and deliver a dynamic global response to crimes against children through the establishment and furtherance of strategic partnerships, the aggressive engagement of relevant law enforcement and the extensive use of liaison, operational support, and co-ordination.  The VCACITF, formerly known as the innocent images international task force, became operational on 6 October 2004 and serves as the largest task force of its kind in the world.  It consists of online child sexual exploitation investigators from around the world and includes more than 69 active members from 40 countries.  The task force hosts a five-week training session for newly invited task force officers, bringing them to the United States to work side by side with Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, agents in the violent crimes against children programme.  The VCACITF also conducts an annual case co-ordination meeting where task force members come together in a central location to share best practices and co-ordinate transnational investigations between members.  Ireland, through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is an active member of this group and engages proactively with Europol, Interpol and the law enforcement authorities in EU member states and further afield, relating to a wide range of initiatives with an international dimension which are designed to tackle child sexual exploitation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop its capacity to tackle cybercrime with a particular focus on protecting children and young people from the impact of the criminality involved and in this regard will interact in an appropriate manner with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508920200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the assistant commissioner.

In education and awareness, we are heavily involved with the NGO sector, for example, with Sport Ireland and the GAA, to enable their members impart the message of the dangers present on the Internet to parents and children.  We are very proactive in passing this message to the communities.  We give media interviews to get the message out.  It is exceptionally important to us to send the message that the Internet is a valuable tool but that it has inherent dangers which children and parents need to be aware of.  We work very closely with Webwise.  We are involved in the Internet safety day on 6 February.

There are certain aspects of them - Mr. Daly will give one example - where we might need an adjustment due to certain developments in the type of criminality involved but the Acts, because of the way they were developed, have proved workable in many regards up to now.  Clearly, there is the prospect that as matters develop we will need additional legislation, particularly in regard to our power to search where people perhaps have a device which we would look upon as a phone but which is now more or less a computer rather than merely a phone.

Another would be the development of a production order that we could serve on a service provider and thereby recover information rather than going through a warrant.  These are additional tools that would assist us.  As the assistant commissioner states, a phone is no longer just a phone, it is a computer-enabled device.

That is why we have worked so hard and put so much of our effort into that.  We have given several lectures and talks.  I recently gave one to prospective primary school teachers in St Patrick's College.  It is difficult to go into classrooms because the children are very young.  We are certainly very open to assisting any educational entity.  We put a lot of work into sports clubs through Sport Ireland and the GAA in particular.  We have given talks to a number of clubs so that their safeguarding officers are fully aware of the dangers on the Internet and that they can recognise cyberbullying and other offences.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned training in Templemore.  Let me split that into two.  As well as the academic training on legislation and procedures they get from Garda College staff, colleagues from my office attend to give practical guidance over a two-day period to all students and probationers.  They also get that practitioner training that gives them information that is grounded and current.  As part of the roll-out of divisional protective services units in February 2018 we have modular training involving about seven or eight modules.  The next module on that training is specifically designed for online child abuse.  We will bring in our own experts.  Dr. Shannon has agreed to assist us with that.  We will have a mixture of our academic trainers, our practitioners and outside stakeholders to ensure have a full and valued course.  That is for the participants in the divisional protective service training.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the challenges.  One of our big concerns relates to self-taken images.  We work very closely with other NGOs, including the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  We have had very close relationships with it in trying to combat that.<\/p> <p>  As the Internet is borderless, one of the challenges is gathering evidence from outside the jurisdiction.  We have the mutual legal assistance treaty which helps us in that, but it can sometimes be very slow.  Our interaction with other police forces is very important in gathering that information.<\/p> <p>  The third challenge probably relates to peer-to-peer information sharing.  Those are the three challenges that jump to mind straightaway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508920200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The developments in technology and the capacity of our cybercrime bureau to interrogate modern technology is a challenge into the future.

It will empower, give them a voice and allow them to be the mammies and daddies to younger children.<\/p><p> Another issue, which I have raised previously, is that we need to make much more use of the journal children get at school which has their classes, diaries and dates in and which parents sign off on.  We could put something in.  I have a cyberbullying chart done by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  It is very simple.  It is addressed to all young people reminding them that their digital behaviour can affect others and that they should treat others as they would like to be treated.  It tells them to take responsibility for their actions on social media, that all actions have consequences and they should think about the potential impact of their actions and make good choices.  We should consider something like that.  It makes the children who will become our young teens and adults more aware.  The difficulty I see is getting the information out there.  We are aware of it but I am not sure how aware of it I would be if I was not on this committee.  We should get the information out in the simplest way using material that is already there.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We should get those messages out using the cheapest way with material people use every day.  I want to emphasise that we should involve our children.  <\/p><p> There are many aspects to staff resources which I have addressed.  Pornography or grooming by adults is not the only concern.  The difficulty comes in when it is child-to-child or young teenager-to-young teenager.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  How is it dealt with?  <\/p><p> What are the witnesses' views on passports being withheld from convicted paedophiles?  A priest is working on this issue and hopes to have it enacted.  If it was to go ahead, I think we will be the first country in the world to do it.  There are serious implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#G01800","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508920200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>It is Fr.

Children are very important and their views are very important.  We can do what we can and we can give talks and lectures.  I do not know how successful it would be if it was a group of children doing that.  We are looking at an initiative with transition year students with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  We will empower them with the knowledge and as part of their transition year programme they will go back to their class and impart that information peer-to-peer.  We are very supportive of that.  A number of schools have indicated they will do the testing.  It will take time to develop because we have to be sure we are getting the right message across and that there is permission from parents.  It is something we are working on with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.<\/p> <p>  We are also very active with Webwise.  It has a number of information streams on its website for different ages and for parents.  That is also important.  There are a number of other organisations.  One does not have to be totally internet proficient to go and find them.  One can get the information quite easily whether it is for a parent, a six year old or a teenager.  It is all there.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned child-to-child pornography and grooming.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when we are dealing with this crime type, is not here to criminalise children for taking images.  It is for somebody who posts an image online.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not to criminalise that child; it is to support the child.  We introduced an initiative with Tusla about two years ago with regard to self-taken images.  There is a co-ordinated approach.  The committee can imagine the shock if a child posts an image online or sends a naked picture to somebody who the child believes is in America or some other jurisdiction and that he or she is sending it to that person in a closed environment and it is then on fire online.  The committee can imagine the shock for that family and child when we go to that house.  We have a co-ordinated approach with Tusla.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with the criminal element to make sure there are no other issues in the home.  Tusla operates on the welfare side.  It has been a very successful initiative to deal with that.  It is very shocking for them.<\/p> <p>  On child-to-child pornography, the issue is education.  We have had cases where images are circulated in schools.  In many of the cases we have had like that, the schools have been excellent.  They come in strong, which is very important.  There is a message there.  A child who holds a pornographic image of another child is committing an offence.  Children need to be educated about that.  There are problems there for that child especially if they distribute the photo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1508920200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late attendance.

That is the motivation for our modernisation and renewal programme creating local units of that nature.  We already have the victims units in place throughout the country.

I am concerned that there could be circumstances where a child has been subject to online harassment, bullying or been subjected to or shared imagery that is beyond their years, where a garda might not be forthright in dealing with it by phoning the bureau.  I do not have any specific examples of this but I am aware of instances, both personally and second-hand, where regrettably a crime is reported and there is a shrug of the shoulders with an attitude that what is being reported is minor.

Apart from training, there is also access to others within the organisation through the garda portal, for instance.  For instance, I was in charge of a unit in human trafficking where we put our documents on the portal and advised people as we trained them that there were documents on the specific types of trafficking cases.  Similarly in this area, the portal has become a significant resource which is accessed by members daily.  All the headquarters directives and training material can be made available there.  The fact that the garda training college was closed for several years during the recession means that it is taking time to get through all the various types of training that must be developed and delivered to people within the organisation.

At the time it came out there was a flurry of activity and we were involved in education about it.  Webwise has very good advice on the app on its website.  We also gave advice on it on our own website.  I do not know why children want to have all these friends.  They want to have online friends.  It is a problem for us.  Children might have 1,000 friends.  They do not know 1,000 people.  They let their guard down online and, because their guard is down, potential offenders or paedophiles will enter that space to try to exploit them.  The whole idea is to educate them that they should limit access to their friends.  All those apps allow for certain controls.  For Snapchat and Snap Map, an account can be closed off so that it is only visible to oneself and one's close friends.  It also has a setting for more open visibility.<\/p> <p>  Really it is a matter of education for parents.  When they are downloading the app and having that conversation with their child, they should be giving that education.  For example, it now seems to be common for children to get a phone around the time of their confirmation.  I wonder how many of the phones given out during the confirmation period come with a discussion or advice from the parent or somebody else.  We would certainly advise that.  No child should get a phone without some accompanying advice.  The parent does not have to have a huge knowledge of the Internet.  Our parents have always told us that we should not talk to strangers.  That goes online as well.  If one takes the scenario of parents in their living room looking outside and seeing their child talking to a stranger, they would challenge the person or talk to the child.

Following its establishment, its operational focus has been in the following four areas: awareness-raising and information activities; co-ordinating the EU safer Internet programme for Ireland with four partner bodies; oversight of takedown procedures for child sexual abuse material, CSAM; and developing strategic actions to promote the highest possible levels of Internet safety, particularly in respect of combating CSAM.<br\/><br\/>To expand on each of these a little, we seek to promote awareness of Internet safety and to highlight its importance for parents, children and all young people.  We try to encourage appropriate conduct on the Internet, not only by raising awareness about preventative actions but also by giving advice on how to respond when individuals are affected by misuse.  In this regard the office publishes a series of booklets on Internet safety particularly aimed at providing guidance to parents on filtering, social networking and cyberbullying.  These booklets are very popular with schools and parents, and in 2016 we issued more than 40,000 of them.  They are also available via our dedicated website, <i>internetsafety.ie<\/i>, which publishes information for parents and guardians together with links to many other useful sites, in particular to our four partner bodies and the helplines associated with them.  In addition, we liaise with the Garda schools programme in the supply of awareness-raising materials for their visits to schools, including materials for the EU-wide Safer Internet Day held in February of each year.<br\/><br\/>Regarding our role in EU safer Internet project funding in Ireland, we partner with four organisations, and we very much work on a partnership model with them - the National Parents Council Primary, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, which I think has otherwise been referred to as Webwise, and <i>hotline.ie<\/i>- in channelling funding to initiatives in the area of child safety.  These bodies focus, respectively, on helping parents, providing a helpline for children, specifically through the Childline service, raising awareness on Internet safety in schools, and the provision of a reporting service for illegal content.  Funding for Internet safety comes under the connecting Europe facility budget envelope and attracts grant funding at a rate of 50% with matched funding from each of the relevant project partners.  We are now in the sixth round of this EU funding programme.  To date Ireland has received approximately &euro;3.4 million in funding.  However, it must be noted that the European Commission has indicated that it is not in favour of extending this funding beyond 2019.<br\/><br\/>A key area of our work relates to the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>reporting system and takedown procedures.  This reactive facility is operated on a voluntary reporting basis by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland.  The activity can vary but, for the most part, it relates to CSAM, which is otherwise referred to as child pornography.  The <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service notifies the Internet service provider which then removes the material.  This is what is referred to as the notice and takedown procedure.  In parallel, <i>hotline.ie<\/i>also notifies An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which investigates sites hosted in Ireland or links with the appropriate authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.<\/p><p>As an additional measure, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2014 with one company, under which the company agreed to block child sexual abuse material, CSAM, as per a list supplied by it.  The Garda continues to engage with other companies with a view to establishing further such arrangements and it works with police forces internationally to seek out such activity continually, and with some very welcome success.<\/p><p> In terms of strategic actions, the office is guided by the Internet safety advisory committee, which is chaired by an industry expert and comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, academia, industry and the four partner bodies that I have already referenced.  Its terms of reference include advising on all aspects of Internet safety and acting as the national stakeholder forum, as required under the EU funding commitments.  The committee meets twice yearly.<\/p><p> I hope I have given sufficient information to help the committee understand our role.  My colleague, Ms McCabe, and I are happy to address any questions or comments members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508920200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee today.  We recognise that the Internet is a powerful and ubiquitous resource in Ireland today.  It plays a hugely important role in all of our lives and can provide a beneficial educational resource for children.  While the Internet brings us opportunities that we could not have imagined 20 years ago, it also brings risks, particularly for children.  The Internet was not designed with children in mind.  It is not always a safe and secure environment for them to be in.  Social media apps and games are designed to encourage their users to use them compulsively and to share personal information extensively.  These are environments that many adults struggle to understand and manage effectively, never mind their children.<\/p> <p>  As children access the Internet from an increasingly young age - seven years in Ireland - we are seeing more problematic incidents arising from its use at home, at school and in the press.  Children are spending many unsupervised hours online.  Our latest survey of 650 children found that 16% were online for more than four hours a day.  Children are sharing too much personal data.  Many children we spoke to admit to not using privacy settings.  Some 12% of the children we spoke to had featured in a YouTube video, despite that being a particularly public platform.  In one class alone, we found that 17 of the nine to ten year olds had featured in videos.<\/p> <p>  The health and well-being of children is being adversely impacted through their overdependence on social media for social and emotional support, with verified adverse consequences for their self-esteem and wider mental health.  Cyberbullying is a growing problem in schools across Ireland and is often the reason we are called into a school in the first place.  Children are being exposed to inappropriate and harmful content.  A 2017 report by the NSPCC in the UK found that 28% of children aged 11 to 12 years had looked at pornography online.  Of great concern in the context of the report is that over half of the 11 to 16 year old boys surveyed found what they had seen to be realistic.<\/p> <p>  We are also concerned about the sexual abuse and exploitation of children online.  We are aware of several cases that have come to the attention of Irish and international law enforcement, each involving hundreds of victims of sexual extortion and grooming.  We are equally concerned about problems of self-generation of sexual imagery by children at increasingly young ages and with the associated problems of peer-on-peer abuse that can result from this behaviour.<\/p> <p>  What can we do to solve the problem in Ireland?  We need Government leadership.  Two weeks ago, the UK Government introduced its Green Paper on Internet safety for consultation.  This paper's stated intention was to make the UK the safest place to be a child online.  While we can debate the value of the range of measures it proposes, there can be no doubt that the UK is much further along in its discussion on how to keep children safe online.  We need to be having these kinds of conversations in Ireland, led by our Government.  At the moment it is difficult to know where responsibility for children's online safety and well-being sits.  Is it with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  Should it sit with a separate body comprising cross-departmental representation?<\/p> <p>  We need prevention.  We strongly believe that the most effective response is prevention through education.  We must equip our young Internet users with the skills and knowledge that they need to navigate the online world safely, responsibly and in ways that are respectful of others.  This provision cannot be offered unsystematically, as it is now, to those children who are lucky enough to live in a location where an online safety expert is available.  This provision must be made available to all children in every corner of the country, wherever a child may be online.  Digital literacy that encompasses online safety education will need to become the fourth pillar of our education system, alongside reading, writing and arithmetic.<\/p> <p>  We need awareness.  We must ensure that parents are engaged in their children's online lives.  Too often, parents tell us that they feel overwhelmed or challenged or that they simply do not know where to start.  \"My child knows more than I do\", is a common refrain on feedback forms.  We need parents to understand the risks and to address those risks at home in an ongoing fashion.  We need a national awareness campaign targeting parents that creates social norms around online safety, much in the way that we have had over the years with road safety and healthy eating campaigns.  We must get to a place where no parent can say, \"I did not know any better.\"<\/p> <p>  We need to respond effectively.  Even with the best will in the world, things will still go wrong.  Children's photos and videos will be shared without consent and some will go viral.  Inappropriate contact will be made with children and bullying will happen.  We have a duty of care to ensure that, when children are harmed online, the child at the centre of it all is protected and supported in the best way possible.  The best way we can do that is by ensuring that the response is timely and appropriate and that the helpline to which the child or parent reaches out is equipped to offer sound advice, support and resources; that the teacher, social worker or garda dealing with the issue has the skills and knowledge he or she needs to work sensitively with parents and children to safeguard the child effectively and minimise harm and anxiety; and that the social media platforms and telecoms companies are highly responsive to children's needs and that the takedown rate, where needed, is fast.<\/p> <p>  There is no way that any one organisation can solve the issue of online safety for children in isolation.  CyberSafeIreland, as the Irish children&rsquo;s charity for online safety, is willing and ready to lend its expertise where it can add value, but ultimately we must work together to deliver solutions.   The Government must lead the way in tackling this issue by showing clear leadership, by creating a national strategy and a task force on online safety for children, and by appointing a digital safety commissioner and resourcing his or her office appropriately.<\/p> <p>  We must invest in education.  We must ensure that every child benefits from a good education on online safety, digital rights, citizenship and well-being and that, when things go wrong, the child at the centre will be effectively protected.  We need to be doing so much more to respond comprehensively to this issue.  Problems of online safety are becoming increasingly urgent for children and parents around the country.  They have the potential to impact on the future of every online child in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We are encouraged that the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has invited us and others to speak on these issues and we hope that this interest will translate in time into greater leadership on and investment in keeping all of our children safe online.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today.  We look forward to the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1508920200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

There was a report by the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications in 2013.  Then, under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which had a different name at the time, the ICGAG report made a number of recommendations.  The Law Reform Commission has quite a substantial report from September 2016.  There are a number of common themes in all of those reports and, based on our experience, we largely concur with them.  There is a need for more awareness-raising and more targeted formal education programmes.  We are told this through our partner bodies as well.  An integrated oversight office on a statutory basis would be important.  The Office for Internet Safety is within the Department of Justice and Equality.  It was a good start.  The Department will always retain that focus on the criminal law aspect and will develop it and take advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other players in the judicial system in terms of what needs to come forward.  The two staff do not have an investigative role; their role is not in that sphere.  We are very much dependent on the partnership we have with other bodies.  The regulated takedown system and the criminal element of it would probably remain with the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>  The strengthened advisory group is something that has come through in all the reports.  We have an advisory group which works but all the reports recommend it should be much broader and that it should include a youth voice and more industry partners.  The UK strategy and Green Paper is very much along the same lines.  What the UK has currently is much broader than what we have.  That is something that comes across.  We also need the development of a national strategy that encompasses all of that.  As CyberSafeIreland acknowledged, which Department one goes to is an issue.  We are all involved in it.

A concern is that if we are to begin to establish task forces and to develop policy that is appropriate for the needs of Irish children in relation to online safety, the required information should be there to inform that policy.  I am a great believer in evidence-driven policy.  A risk in this space is that we do not want to be led only by the examples of good practice that exist and are available from other countries because there are very specific needs and trends that present for Irish children in terms of their online use and digital behaviours that need to be addressed in a case-specific fashion.<\/p> <p>  I believe a lot of the work that has been advanced by Professor Brian O'Neill, who sits on our board, has been done with the support of the European Commission under the aegis of broader programmes such as EU Kids Online that was spearheaded by Professor Sonia Livingstone and currently the Better Internet for Kids initiative, which again is a European Commission-funded initiative.  The kinds of information such reports provide and the reports we do based on our own research are important.  It is broad and sweeping and gives us a sense of the scale of the use and the kind of apps and services they are using and the associated risks, for example.  What it does not tell us, however, and which is a permanent gap in terms of most of the research evidence in this space, is what children themselves need.  One of the things that makes our own research stand apart is that we are very concerned to listen to what children are telling us rather than just surveying them and seeing how many nine to 16 year olds are using WhatsApp or any other messaging service.  That does not give us very useful information from a targeting perspective in terms of targeting messages and speaking to and responding to the issues that are being faced by children.  In terms of the sufficiency of the research evidence in the Irish space, it is great that we have the statistical information that is available to us, but I have a concern that it does not dip low enough in terms of the lower age bracket at which children are starting to use the Internet.  We know that children are online at a much younger age than, for example, nine years.  We need to know more about their experiences, what it is to grow up as an Internet user in Ireland and to bring the child's voice to this debate as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the task force, who should sit on it and where it might sit in relation to the office of a digital safety commissioner, that is an open question.  I worked in the UK for a number of years for the National Crime Agency's child exploitation and online protection command in a research and policy role, and at that time the Home Office established a task force for child protection on the Internet, which is now the UK Council for Child Internet Safety.  That sat within and across the justice and home affairs area at the time but it has now expanded beyond that, in particular with the increasing issues around children's Internet usage.  It is not so much a criminal problem anymore.  It still is a criminal problem in terms of the kinds of imagery that are being generated, but it is also a social problem that extends into all sorts of issues relating to education, in particular in the prevention space.<\/p><p> Regarding who would sit on the task force, many of the stakeholders have already been named, such as the telecommunications industry, representatives of academia and representatives from the charitable sector, which is particularly the case in Ireland because so many of our preventative responses rely on that third sector at present.  Obviously, there would be representation from the appropriate Departments.  I believe a cross-departmental body would be preferable.  The role in respect of the commissioner would have to be advisory.  There would have to be some independent advisory body that is advising the commissioner rather than sitting within the office of the commissioner.  There must be independence because the issues I am discussing are complex, social, nuanced and dynamic.  They change and therefore the relative roles of the stakeholders in this task force will change over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maggie Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508920200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Collaboration is key.

That is critical.  As an Internet safety charity, we know what our key messages are to children and parents, but if we were not talking to children all the time, we would not understand why their behaviour is not changing on hearing these key messages at the level they are currently getting them.  For example, one of the messages we give to children is that they should not share their passwords.  They will nod and say they will not share them.  However, when they are asked how many of them have shared a password, many will put up their hands.  Unless we them ask why, we will not understand why they will share their password.  It will be for something such as all of them being on Snapchat.  There is a feature in Snapchat where a person can be on a Snapstreak and the children are regularly into this.  If I snap Deputy Rabbitte every day, we can keep a Snapstreak going, and the higher it gets, the more kudos I get.  Children love this and they are all over it.  As a result, if they are going on holidays or their device is not available to them, they will share a password.

The witness speaks a great deal about education and continuing professional development, CPD, in schools for teachers.  There is a conflict in my mind around this.  I am a parent.  Is there an onus on the parent to have the primary responsibility in respect of educating his or her child about Internet safety?  To say that I have mental blockages about using the technology and so forth is not really sufficient in this day and age.  A parent teaches his or her child the safe cross code, road safety and all sorts of other safety mechanisms.  I have a perception, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, that sometimes parents will say that it is the role of the school through PDST, Webwise and so forth to educate their children on Internet safety.  Webwise does not necessarily reach every school and not every teacher has taken up the CPD.  Representatives of Webwise have appeared before the committee.  If the CPD is not inculcated within the teaching and academic institutions as a core subject, it is likely that there will be a great deal of slippage in this regard.  What is the witnesses' perspective on that?  I believe every teacher should be equipped compulsorily, but how do we marry the role of the teacher with the role of the parent?  I am sorry if I am a little long-winded but the witnesses understand what I am saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017102500002#P00700","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508920200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>There are two issues here: the role of parents and whether they feel equipped to take on this issue and the role of teachers.

Parents are really struggling and do not know where to start.  It is so tempting just to wish the Internet away and to wish one did not have this problem in parenting because it is a huge challenge.  The reality is that they must deal with it, and they must be equipped to do so.  Parents need more support and they need to have confidence.  They do not have to be technical experts but they must have the confidence to take on their primary role of safeguarding their children and empowering them to use technology in a healthy way.

The school is probably the primary institution with which parents will interact in respect of their children up to the age of 18 years.  We are talking about distilling this down and creating a platform nationally whereby parents voluntarily interact with schools and the programmes are delivered through that.  Parents go to parent-teacher meetings.  There is no reason that on one night per year there could not be outreach programme, for example, for every school in the country.  It would only require two or three hours.  Parents would interact with each other thereafter and natural collaborations would begin to build up through parents interacting with each other.

They do not know about Snapchat.  They do not know about the apps the children are using.  They are terrified of the questions.  They do not even want to go there.  Some would describe themselves as quite tech savvy and they are interested and motivated, but they are just not using the same technology as the children.  That is what we really need to address.  How do we find a way to do so?  We have looked at this issue over the last couple of years and we have recommendations on how this could be done.  It is probably unrealistic to expect every teacher out there not only to be tech savvy enough or to have the confidence to be able to address this issue, but also to spend the time to develop a level of expertise which allows them to advise a principal on issues that are coming up, to be able to talk to parents about it and to deliver talks to parents.

I only have one question for our witnesses.  It relates to education.  Does either the Office of Internet Safety or CyberSafeIreland have a relationship with, for instance, the Irish Primary Principals Network?  A moment ago, Ms Curley reference the willingness of primary teachers and whether they felt they had sufficient information and wherewithal to engage in a teaching programme.  Aside from training and continuous professional development for those individual teachers who feel they have a deficiency in that very narrow field, where do the principals come in on this issue?  Ultimately, they manage the schools and it is their responsibility to ensure that the curriculum and any additional elements are being implemented within the four walls of their schools.  I would have thought that it might be an avenue for discussion with both primary and secondary school teaching networks.<\/p> <p>  The other avenue, which should be considered automatically, is the unions, because virtually every practitioner in the field of education is unionised.  From my few months as Chairman of this committee, I know that the trade union movement is heavily involved in the committee's area.  It does some really good work.  It would certainly be of benefit to try to tap into those organisations and bodies because they appear, at least from my brief, superficial reading, to have something to bring to the table.  <\/p> <p>  I compliment Deputy Sherlock.  He is right in that it is necessary for somebody to map the entirety of what the child services and child protection community is doing in the State.  While duplication is not unusual, in this instance I would imagine that all the bodies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and others, are attempting to do the exact same thing on the cyber side.  There may be distinct roles in certain aspects on the criminality side, the preventative side and the education side, but ultimately determining who is doing what and why, and how we can better support them, perhaps through the appointment of a digital commissioner or a single point of authority within the entirety of the sector and all Government Departments, is of critical importance.

The first is a letter from Ms Cora Sherlock dated 18 October 2017 and addressed to me.  <\/p> <p>  Dear Senator Noone, <\/p> <p>  I would appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight about comments made by me that were misrepresented by Deputy Ruth Coppinger at last week&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the 8th Amendment. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger called into question statements I have previously made surrounding the rate of abortion of babies diagnosed with Down Syndrome in the womb in England and Wales, namely that 90% of babies diagnosed with the condition are aborted. <\/p> <p>  As on previous occasions, Deputy Coppinger disputed this figure, claiming instead that the correct rate is 44% and seeking confirmation from Dr. Fergal Malone who indicated that the abortion rate from the Rotunda when babies are diagnosed with Down Syndrome is already around 50% even with the 8th Amendment in place. <\/p> <p>  By means of clarification, I would point to the fact that under Ground E of the Abortion Act 1967, abortion is allowed to birth if the baby in the womb is diagnosed with any disability or foetal anomaly and this includes Down Syndrome. <\/p> <p>  I would refer to the Parliamentary Inquiry into Abortion on the Grounds of Disability (July 2013). Item 21 on page 14\/15 of this Report states that &ldquo;approximately 90% of babies with a definite diagnosis of Down Syndrome are aborted&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  This figure has been generally accepted within the wider abortion debate and is regularly referred to by disability rights activists such as the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Screen Us Out&rdquo; campaign in the UK which is trying to preserve the right to life of babies diagnosed with Down Syndrome in the womb.  I would add that this worrying phenomena was highlighted at the January session of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly when reference was made to a worldwide &ldquo;trend&rdquo; of aborting babies on the basis of a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. <\/p> <p>  I ask that you bring this letter to the attention of your fellow colleagues on the Committee and that it be read into the record. <\/p> <p>With every good wish. <\/p> <p>Yours Sincerely, <\/p> <p>__________________ <\/p> <p>Cora Sherlock <\/p> <p>Pro Life Campaign <\/p> <p>  The next is an email from Dr. Peter Boylan dated 25 October 2017.<\/p> <p>Dear Senator Noone,<\/p> <p>  Thank you again for the invitation to last Wednesday's meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment.  I was very impressed with the work of the Committee and thought the session was notable for the most part for its thoughtful and open-minded questioning and collegial atmosphere. <\/p> <p>  However, although Senator Ronan Mullen was absent for much of the committee on other business, while he was present he made several assertions at odds with the facts regarding what was said at the hearing in respect of my evidence.  The next day, he appeared on at least two radio shows, during which he repeated those inaccurate assertions.<\/p> <p>  In particular, he repeatedly claimed that Savita Halappanavar's treating consultant in Galway did not \"hide behind the Eighth Amendment\", i.e. that Dr Astbury was in no way constrained by the Eighth Amendment.  This claim was made in direct contradiction of the evidence of both myself and Professor Arulkumaran last week.  I am therefore attaching for your attention, and that of the committee, transcripts of the third day of the inquest into Ms Halappanavar's death, in which it is absolutely apparent that Dr. Astbury, her treating consultant, could not have been clearer about how the eighth amendment prevented her from intervening.  The relevant section is on pages 46 and 47, questions 176 to 179, inclusive.<\/p> <p>  I have also attached Professor Arulkumaran's evidence to the committee last week in response to Senator Lynn Ruane in which he categorically stated that the eighth amendment contributed to Savita Halappanavar's death (page 30 of transcript).<\/p> <p>  Both of us reviewed Ms Halappanavar's full medical case records, and Professor Arulkumaran also had the advantage of interviewing those involved in her care in University Hospital Galway.<\/p> <p>  This point is so fundamental to your hearings that I believe the record should be corrected in respect of Senator Mullen's inaccurate assertions last Wednesday that the eighth amendment did not constrain Ms Halappanavar's treating doctor.<\/p> <p>  Yours sincerely,<\/p> <p>Peter Boylan.<\/p> <p>  For the purposes of clarification, the attachments referred in the email will be available on the website and form part of the record of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#E00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Risks to Mental Health of Pregnant Women: Professor Veronica O'Keane","time":1508934600,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#F00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Before we begin our first session, members and those in the Visitors Gallery are reminded, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, to ensure their mobile phones are turned off completely for the duration of the meeting.  <\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i><i>l<\/i><\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I hope I can be of help to them in their task of interpreting the findings of the Citizens' Assembly.  I have been asked specifically to give my opinion as an expert in the field of mental health.  My current role is a joint academic and clinical one, as consultant psychiatrist in the service of the HSE at Tallaght hospital and professor of clinical psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin where I lead a research programme in perinatal psychiatry.  My previous experience includes leading a national perinatal psychiatry service in London for five years at the Maudsley Hospital which covered all of the United Kingdom.  Concurrently with that position, I was head of the perinatal psychiatry section at King's College GKT School of Medical Education where I led a research programme in perinatal depression.  I have had papers published in the scientific literature on the subject of perinatal depression and written a book on the topic.  I co-authored the standard clinical assessment tool for perinatal psychiatry disorder in the United Kingdom and served as an expert for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in devising guidelines for clinicians on the management of perinatal depression.  I set up two hospital psychiatry services, including the suicide prevention service in Beaumont Hospital.  I was an expert witness at the two Oireachtas hearings which led to the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and also privileged to serve as an expert witness at the Citizens' Assembly.  Last March I co-hosted, with the National Women's Council of Ireland, the World Congress on Women's Mental Health at the RDS in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  I begin by thanking the members of the Citizens' Assembly for their work.  The process and governance of the assembly in its consideration of the eighth amendment were an example of the best of democratic principles in action.  Its conclusions were solution-focused and not ideologically driven.  Most of the recommendations made are relevant to mental health, but they have been spelled out in a very helpful way that leaves no room for ambiguity.  That clarity is one of the strengths of the document.  A majority of the citizens recommended 12 reasons for which termination of a pregnancy should be lawful in Ireland.  For each general health reason listed, a parallel mental health reason was given.  For example, where 99% voted that abortion should be lawful when there was a real and substantial risk to the life of a woman, 95% voted the same where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide.  Similarly, 93% and 90%, respectively, of the citizens supported abortion where there was a serious risk to the physical health of a woman and a serious risk to her mental health.  The same applied to a risk, as opposed to a serious risk, to physical health and mental health, with 79% and 78%, respectively, voting that abortion should be available to women in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There are two particular points I wish to highlight in respect of the assembly's recommendations.  The first is that, as I have outlined, support levels for the provision of abortion care for medical and mental health reasons were very similar.  In fact, 72% of members recommended that a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of women.  That recommendation was an enormous relief to me and my colleagues.  The mind-body dualism division has plagued our society and created much unnecessary suffering, leading to stigmatisation of and discrimination towards those who suffer with psychiatric disorders.  Separation of mental health from physical health has been at the heart of the debate about abortion for the past three decades, following on from the 1992 ruling in the X case that suicide risk constituted grounds for an abortion.  We have had two referendums, in 1992 and 2002, where suicide was upheld by a majority of voters as a legitimate reason for an abortion.  We had a very difficult debate on the suicide provision leading up to the enactment of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill in 2012 and 2013.  It is now recognised in law that suicide constitutes a risk to the life of the woman in the circumstances of an unwanted pregnancy.  The Citizens' Assembly understood there was no distinction between physical and mental health and made its understanding explicit.  The importance of that recommendation cannot be underestimated and changes everything.<\/p> <p>  I will comment briefly on dualism which has been a very destructive force in society's understanding of health.  It might seem evident, but it is important to point out that the brain controls the body.  While one may feel sad in one's heart or anxious in one's gut, these feelings are directed from the brain.  The dialogue between the body and the brain is never stronger than during pregnancy because the pregnant uterus produces hormones which cross into the pregnant woman's brain and modify the emotional brain.  Emotional changes also occur because pregnancy is very challenging and parenthood is probably the most serious challenge any of us will face in our lifetimes.  <\/p> <p>  My research group has looked at rates of depression during pregnancy, the first such study to be conducted in Irish maternity hospitals.  We found rates of 16%, which is slightly higher than EU norms.  Being depressed when pregnant is a very serious problem.  Not only is the woman intensely distressed, but the stress hormones alter the baby's physiology such that the foetus is growing in a high-stress milieu and at increased risk of being born earlier and with obstetric problems.  Depressed pregnant women are often unable to attend to their own needs and do not present as regularly for outpatient appointments as non-depressed women.  Infants born to women who are depressed during pregnancy are more likely to suffer from childhood learning and behavioural problems and depression in early adulthood.  All of this demonstrates that the emotional brain is important not just to the general well-being of the pregnant woman but also to the subsequent health of her baby and that baby's trajectory throughout life.  The treatment of psychiatric disorders in pregnancy is seen as a priority for this reason.<\/p> <p>  An unplanned or unwanted pregnancy increases the risk of depression during pregnancy.<\/p><p>A US study of more than 100,000 women was published earlier this year.  The study examined the relationship between unwanted pregnancy and perinatal depression.  The study showed that an unwanted pregnancy increased the rates of perinatal depression by 50%.  It must be said that in this study, as in all other published studies from OECD countries, the option of legal abortion was available for these women.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Excuse me, Professor O'Keane, for interrupting but there is a phone interfering with her microphone.

This point was made again in a very impressive meta-analysis published by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in London.  It showed that the academic literature only reflects findings where abortion services are available.  There are no scientific studies from OECD countries on mental health outcomes where women could be forced to go through with an unwanted pregnancy.  We are talking about high risks of depression in countries where women have the option of legal abortion.<br\/><br\/>The difference between Ireland and other OECD countries is a woman's only option to obtain an abortion here is to travel.  Access to this service is facilitated by State funded information services.  A service based in another jurisdiction clearly has inherent problems that will affect the mental health of the woman.  There will always be women who will be unable to travel for an abortion.  The situation with the migrant women who are unable to travel has been very painfully laid out by the case of Miss Y.  I have seen women in my own practice who were unable to travel because of hostility from abusive partners or threats from their community where abortion is unacceptable, culturally.  <br\/><br\/>The category of women who are too sick to travel also includes women who have debilitating mental illness.  I have patients who are too sick to travel to an outpatient clinic without being accompanied by a community psychiatric nurse.  Many of these women have never travelled outside of Dublin.  It would be way beyond their capacity or personal resources to travel to the UK.  Neither would they have the capacity to source the abortion pills nor would any of the mental health workers be able to facilitate them in doing so because it is obviously a crime.  Women with a handicap such as this need to be compassionately cared for in settings appropriate to their high needs. <br\/><br\/>The second problem about having a <i>de facto<\/i>UK-based service is one that every Irish woman or girl who travels bears.  The UK path to abortion is a sad and shameful one that Irish women have endured for five decades and it is damaging to women's mental health.  It is filled with shame and humiliation.  The girl or woman is easily identified and sees herself as being easily identified.  What should be a private and sensitively conducted procedure becomes a public journey.  <br\/><br\/>At the heart of the problem of abortion in Ireland is one issue - unwanted pregnancies.  It is self-evident that there will always be unwanted pregnancies.  There always have been and there will always be a requirement for abortion.  The mental health arguments for decent abortion services apply not just to the women who need abortion care.  I would go further and say that the mental health of everybody in Ireland is being damaged by the eighth amendment because we are all shamed by the current situation.  <br\/><br\/>To conclude, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly are a welcome departure from the dualism of physical versus mental health in its recognition that mental well-being is inseparable from physical well-being.  This is particularly relevant in pregnancy where high levels of emotional vulnerability are inseparable from the physiology of the pregnancy.  The recommendation that all facets of mental well-being, from suicide risk to damage to mental health, be considered as grounds for abortion takes into account the complexity of each individual woman's psychological experience of an unwanted pregnancy and the unpredictability of risk.  The rigidity of constitutional absolutes is the polar opposite of what we need to deal with the needs or pregnant women who have unwanted pregnancies.  I think a solution-based compassionate response to this problem will require the removal of the prohibition on abortion from the Constitution.  I agree with the recommendation made by the Citizens' Assembly that a legal framework that allows for the unpredictability of obstetric and psychiatric risk should be put in place.  A mental health service needs to be embedded within future abortion care because of the complexity of the emotional issues that are frequently experienced in unwanted pregnancies. <br\/><br\/>The constitutional ban and the consequent rigid legal restrictions in Ireland can escalate psychiatric risk.  The constitutional vice-grip and the legal complexities that have followed makes the mental health care of women within unwanted pregnancies unpredictable and is an obstacle to care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the professor and apologise for the interruptions.

I do not think we are treating the women who are suicidal, because of unwanted pregnancies, in Ireland.  I think we are treating the women who are suicidal with unwanted pregnancies, who are unable to travel, in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  So far, seven women, theoretically, have had their lives save by the legislation.  Obviously that is a very good thing in itself.  It is a very good thing that we have legislation that will save women's lives if their lives are at risk because of being pregnant.  In that sense the legislation has worked.  It is very clumsy legislation and the majority of my colleagues feel very uncomfortable with trying to work within this legislation.  It is very difficult for women.  As most people here probably know, three specialist assessments are required.  The legislation also requires that the woman would go to a GP or an accident and emergency doctor who would initially refer her.  In order to have a legal abortion because of a risk of suicide a woman must see a minimum of five doctors.  If one of those doctors is unwilling to see her the process is clearly lengthened and that has happened quite a lot with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Colleagues feel uncomfortable with the legislation and do not want to deal with the matter.  A woman who has been referred by a GP or an accident and emergency department presents to the doctors.  The first person may say, \"I am not comfortable with this, call me a conscientious objector\".  He or she rings up his or her clinical director who also says: \"Call me a conscientious objector, I am not comfortable with this legislation.\"<\/p><p>The clinical director then rings another colleague.  It may escalate to a national level and a psychiatrist from a national panel might have to be called.  There is usually a period of delay in which the woman does not know what is happening because no one knows what is happening.  She may then see someone who does not believe that she fulfils the criteria, so the process must restart.  It is distressing for a woman who is feeling suicidal, is pregnant and is highly vulnerable to have to repeat her story to everyone.  Every time she tells the story, it is an emotional journey that takes an emotional toll on her, and she is someone who is suicidal.  In my practice, I try to minimise the number of people to whom my sick patients have to talk.  If a patient has already been clerked in an accident and emergency department, I will see him or her next and say that the patient does not need to be clerked again in a ward.  The repetitive intrusion into a patient's extremely private crisis is counter to good sensitive practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#G02000","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Is there an indication of how long the delay is?

Most of the women I have seen in this regard have been mothers and have been trying to pretend that this is not happening to them.  They are not given any reassurance about whether it will happen.  They are usually financially destitute, but are unable to look for money because they must hide the fact that they are seeking an abortion.

The fact that there is no register of those who applied and, dare I use the word, were unsuccessful in their applications is remiss of us because we cannot get a clear picture of how the legislation operates other than through the evidence that Professor O'Keane has given us, which is that the Act often leaves a woman in acute distress for up to two weeks while colleagues await a decision.  That is most unfortunate, but it is welcome that this information is now in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Keane might address two points.  First, it is clear from her opening statement but, in her opinion, are her pregnant patients who require psychiatric care more at risk of suffering physical ill health as a result of their mental ill health?  The two are inextricably linked.  Maybe Professor O'Keane might expand on that point.<\/p> <p>  Second is a point that we should probably be addressing in every session.  There is an argument that, in the event of us making a change, be it large or small, to the level of access that Irish women have to abortion care, we will somehow be opening floodgates and there will be a dramatic increase.

I do not understand the floodgate phenomenon.  A good presentation made to the committee earlier showed that the rate of abortion had been steady over the years, although I hope that it will decline slightly with better contraceptive care.  The availability of abortion pills on the web has increased and the rate of travel for surgical abortions has reduced.  The floodgates are open and always have been.  They have only been pointed towards the UK.  We have a <i>de facto<\/i>abortion service.  It is just not in our own country.  I cannot see making abortion legal in Ireland changing the number of women having abortions.  Rather, I hope that, by having a better health service that is more women focused, inclusive, sensitive and compassionate, we will reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and improve our care for women with unwanted pregnancies.  At the heart of this matter is giving care to women who have unwanted pregnancies.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's other question was on whether a woman who was depressed would be at an increased risk of developing obstetric problems or other physical ill health.  That is definitely true.  If one is depressed in any circumstance in life, one is at greater risk of becoming medically unwell.  That is because our stress system is controlled in our brain.  It is the control station for the secretion of our stress hormones.  If I am stressed, my brain tells my adrenal glands to secrete cortisol.  Being in a stressed condition for a long period of time is damaging physiologically.  It has been shown to lead to cancers, heart disease, lung disease and osteoporosis.  Every physiological system is sensitive to stress hormones, particularly long-term exposure.  During pregnancy, there is a rapidly developing foetal system.  It will of course be sensitive to stress hormones.<\/p><p>If we are thinking about abortion care, we should be thinking about it in the care of the general mental health of pregnant women, and as I stated previously, specifically in the area of unwanted pregnancies.  \"Yes\", is the answer.  Are specific disorders that are specific to pregnancy, such as pre eclampsia, Caesarian section and obstetric complications, more likely during pregnancy if a woman is depressed?  \"Yes\" is the answer.  Being depressed disadvantages the woman and the foetus, and the delivery of the foetus into the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Keane for coming in today.<\/p><p>There are just a couple of things I want to touch on.  Professor O'Keane's presentation was very helpful.<\/p><p>On this division of mind and body health which Professor O'Keane referred to as dualism, and which she stated today is found by the Citizens' Assembly to be the entirely wrong approach, she quotes a study showing that, according to her statement: &quot;Pregnancy is associated with increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms and is the highest risk period in a woman's life for depression.&quot;  The following are three questions around that whole concept.  Is an unplanned or forced pregnancy a threat to the short and long-term mental health of the woman carrying it and can it cause mental harm to others around her?  When a couple - two people together - are challenged by an unplanned or unexpected pregnancy, what effects does this pregnancy have upon the mental health of the man?  When a couple seek a termination together, is there any evidence that the male partner can suffer from mental health challenges, such as stress, depression, guilt, shame and emotional pain also?  Has Professor O'Keane any experience with the effects on the men in the situation?<\/p><p>I am conscious that some people are trying to shut down a debate regarding mental health grounds by proclaiming that abortion is not a solution for suicidal ideation.  Would Professor O'Keane agree that, while the act of administering an abortion may not <i>per se<\/i>be a solution, circumstances can differ from woman to woman and the option to access an early termination is far more likely to result in better outcomes for the mental health of the woman and her partner?<\/p><p>In Professor O'Keane's professional opinion, should mentally-ill pregnant women who do not want to be pregnant be subject to internment until they have delivered a child and would this be harmful to their mental health?  Are Ireland's laws acceptable to retain without alteration?  Do they adequately assist women who are too poor to travel for a termination who may be immigrants without papers - Professor O'Keane spoke about women with diminished mental and physical capacity - or women who are psychiatrically unwell to the point of psychosis, delusion or catatonia?  What did we do in the past and what do we do currently with poor people, mentally unwell people or those with diminished capacity?  What I am trying to get at here is what Professor O'Keane spoke about in her statement.  Who is left behind?  Really, that is what I am getting at here.  I would ask Professor O'Keane to elaborate on some of that in her professional capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#J00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell.  There are quite a few questions in that.  I will start again at the end because of my short attention span.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell talked about the vulnerable women who were unable to travel.  If I had to pick the worst situations that arise from our current situation in relation to an absence of a proper abortion service it would be those of the women who are left behind.  It is the women who sometimes do not have the education to understand how to access resources.  They do not have the confidence to go to professionals.  They do not have the knowledge to access the professionals and they do not have the confidence to talk to those professionals about what they might want.  They may be ashamed of what they want.  They may be in a terrible state of conflict about it.  They may want an abortion and not be able to put words on it.  There are as many extremely sad situations as there are women pregnant who are left behind in that very vulnerable category.<\/p> <p>  I can only talk about my experience of dealing with very vulnerable women who have very significant mental health disorders.  I might be talking about women who may not even understand that they are pregnant for a few months.  Perhaps the medication they are on is suppressing their menstruation and they do not have regular cycles, and they may not even be aware.  By the time they become aware of the pregnancy, they could be 14 to 16 weeks pregnant.  They are unable to process the idea that they have to go for maternity care and their GP will try and sort out their obstetric care, when they go to their GPs.  This group of women do not have sensitive, appropriate services that can meet their high needs.  These sensitive services are available in other branches of medicine for these women.  I have had women who have had breast cancer and they have had really wonderfully appropriately sensitive services, in terms of guiding them through the palliative stage of their care and, indeed, from the palliative stage of their care to their passing.  We can only guess about those women.  In a sense, I know that group of women are left behind.  We should feel ashamed by the fact that these women are ignored and neglected.<\/p> <p>  In relation to early abortions, obviously, the earlier an abortion, the better it is for the woman.  The situation that we have in Ireland delays abortion.  I have just told the committee how the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act  2013 is cumbersome and certainly delays abortions, but travelling also delays abortions because some women do not have passports, some women do not have the finances and some women have not made up their excuses that they are going away with a friend for a weekend for fun in Liverpool or whatever.  Obviously, travel takes away a woman's privacy.  That is probably one of the worst aspects of it but it also leads to later abortions.  It is an established fact that the average age of gestation of Irish women is higher than that of women in the UK.<\/p> <p>  On unplanned pregnancies, I think the Deputy referred to \"unplanned and forced pregnancies\".  I guess I would see them as being in very different categories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>\"Or forced\" not \"and forced\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#J00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Unplanned pregnancies obviously can become wanted pregnancies and everybody is happy.  Of course, unplanned pregnancies can become unwanted pregnancies and as I said, sometimes that is an ambivalent place for a woman to be.  Some women will remain ambivalent and they will obviously proceed with the pregnancy, and those women need a lot of support because they are at a very increased risk of developing depression and having complications with parenting.<\/p> <p>  However, the women who have the unwanted pregnancies who want an abortion can be in a very difficult position because, obviously, they many not be able to travel.  We are letting those women down with the current situation here and forcing them to travel; we are putting women who are unable to travel in positions of having pregnancies that are not wanted which leads to children that are not wanted.  It is an issue that does not raise its ugly head often, but it does happen.  My practice is full of adults who were not wanted as children and that has to be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  In terms of forced pregnancies, obviously, it is very important that women who have forced pregnancies have immediate access to abortion care that is sensitive to their situation.<\/p> <p>  On the mental health of men, in my view men are very traumatised by the situations that their pregnant wives can find themselves in in relation to unwanted pregnancies.<\/p><p>The committee will hear evidence later today from a man, Gerry Edwards, who will be able to tell the committee a lot about it from his point of view.<\/p><p> On abortion and non-foetal anomaly abortion, there is not much literature.

There are ten people who travel daily and the five who we know now are taking abortion pills in their own bedrooms, so that is 15 people a day.  Today we are discussing mental health which is critical for all those people, and later we will discuss rape and fatal foetal abnormality, which probably accounts for about 6%, and is a small minority among the reasons people have abortions.  The evidence this committee has heard over recent weeks has been resounding regarding the need for abortion legislation which deals with the reality of all those people, the 92% who fall under the abortion under 12 weeks, on request, which is just one recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly which could deal with this entire issue.

I cannot say that because I did not ask that question, but it is a sad fact that our rates of antenatal depression are higher than in other European countries, or at least that is what our research has indicated.  In response to what I think Deputy Coppinger is asking, which relates to her previous point about lower socioeconomic status and socioeconomic disadvantage, rates of depression are higher and rates of unwanted pregnancy are higher in women who are socio-economically disadvantaged.  When we are looking at depression and abortion needs, we are talking about the most vulnerable people.  When we are looking at people who cannot travel, we are talking about the same group of marginalised very vulnerable people.  They are the people we are turning our backs on.  I do think we are also treating women who have the means in a very shoddy and humiliating way, but the women who bear the brunt of the constitutional ban on abortion here are the very vulnerable women.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the study, it could be interpreted that the lack of abortion in this country or the fact that our services are <i>de facto<\/i>in another jurisdiction does lead to higher rates of unwanted pregnancies and therefore higher rates of depression, but it could also be that our perinatal psychiatry services are very underdeveloped.  I know that Dr. Anthony McCarthy is coming here in the near future to give evidence in relation to that because he works directly within that service, so I will leave that to him.  We are woefully under-resourced here.  Colleagues from around the world are gobsmacked at the situation.  When they came to the conference in March they were absolutely amazed at the lack of health care services in perinatal psychiatry in Ireland.  I do think the issues are connected.  I think perhaps the entire mental health area is a no-go area because we are ignoring a very big problem.  Once we allow ourselves to see that there is a need, embrace it and look for pragmatic solutions I think a lot of other services will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Keane for her presentation.  It is a very important topic that we do not talk much about.  She made a comment about the women who are left behind and that got me thinking about the women who cannot travel or who cannot access abortion, who may be in the mental health system for whatever reason in terms of the severity of their condition.  Without identifying women, in my career in addiction services I have watched women with dual diagnosis.  I remember one woman who wanted to access abortion very early not being able to.  She was seen as presenting with addiction not having a dual diagnosis.  I remember her just giving up on that.  When she did continue with the pregnancy, which she did not want, I watched her fight for a long time through the courts to try to hold on to that child so she was traumatised over and over again for her mental illness.  She could not win in any way.  Some people have the impression that when pregnancies continue the women are glad that they did and they go off and have normal, happy lives and everything is okay.  Could Professor O'Keane comment on the effects on some of those women because of how we have treated people with mental health difficulties in this country?  If one has a physical illness such as cancer nobody accuses one of not being able to look after one's children but if one has a mental illness people will assume one is not capable of caring for one's children.  What kind of support is there for women in that situation?  Without identifying individuals could she refer to some of those women who have found themselves in that situation?<\/p> <p>  When we looked at the risk to physical health the witnesses who came in were very clear that there is no one moment in time where one can identify, regulate or create legislation for the point at which one becomes a serious risk.  Because we are making no distinction between mental and physical illness, does that same principle underpin mental health in the sense that there is no moment in time when one can say a person has gone from being a minor risk to a serious risk?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#L00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane has brought up a number of points.  The point about the woman with dual diagnosis should not arise.  If somebody is suicidal somebody is suicidal, and if they are suicidal because they are pregnant then the analysis does not have to go below that unless there is a treatable mental disorder which is making them suicidal and is not related to the pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  Situations are very complicated so I guess third hand information is very difficult to comment on, so I will talk perhaps about my own experience instead of addressing that directly.  Some people have very complicated lives.  They have complicated lives because they were born into situations of deprivation that are unimaginable to a lot of us.  Children are neglected.  They are left in dirty nappies.  They are not spoken to.  Nobody gets them up in the morning or puts them to bed.  I have a lot of contact with Tusla because a lot of my patients were brought up like that.  Of course they need psychiatric services in adulthood and of course they have difficulties parenting.  It begets a cycle.  If one does not have control over one's reproductive fertility or whether or not one has children, if one cannot practise responsible parenthood this situation of deprivation is going to continue.  I think it is a very important societal point.  If one has somebody with dual diagnosis I would say that increases rather than diminishes the risk.  On the other hand, if a woman changes her mind during a pregnancy, if she initially has an unwanted pregnancy and then decides it is wanted then that wish should be respected.  The same choice that pertains to choosing whether or not to continue with a pregnancy also pertains to whether or not one wants to be a parent, if one continues with a pregnancy, even if one is being forced to continue with the pregnancy.  Choice is terribly important.  If a woman does want to continue with a pregnancy and she is in dire circumstances, what we need to do as a society and as a medical service is to intervene with all the supports we can muster to help her.<\/p><p>We really try to break the transgenerational transmission of deprivation by targeting young mothers who have children and who want help.  It is very satisfying work, because the children benefit from it and the mothers develop great confidence in their own lives and in their abilities to mother.  When we are talking about abortion, we are talking about parental care as well, and all those other services.  This debate allows us to talk about issues that we could not talk about previously, such as very difficult parenting, children who were perhaps not wanted and became wanted, or children who are simply not wanted whom the State may have to provide for or for whom alternative parents may have to be found.  It is a very complex area, but in my experience it is tremendously satisfying, and intervening when families are young to try to help women parents, regardless of whether those children where even considered or ever wanted, can be done.  We need that as much as we need abortion services. <\/p><p> Senator O'Connell asked a question about how we treat younger women and girls and whether it would be appropriate to detain them in psychiatric hospitals if they are suicidal because of unwanted pregnancies.  I believe that is absolutely and utterly unacceptable.  The case of the 15 year old who was detained is unacceptable.  I am not talking as a psychiatrist who knows anything about the case.  I am talking as a citizen who is observing what has happened.  Pregnant women who are suicidal because of their pregnancy should never be locked up and detained, ever.  If we are stooping to that level of abandonment and putting girls in captivity who are in desperately complicated and distressing situations emotionally, we really need to look deep into our hearts.  We need to move this legislation forward because it is absolutely the wrong way of doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am trying to manage time for each individual member so I apologise if I intervene to speed things up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#M00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor O'Keane to the committee.

It is difficult to apply such studies to Ireland because unwanted pregnancies were examined but there was quite a bit of ambivalence in terms of the unwanted pregnancies as some of the women who had unwanted pregnancies had abortions while others had unwanted pregnancies but did not have abortions.  Those were the two groups analysed in the study.  In a place where there is no access to abortion, the quality of unwanted pregnancies will be different because one could not say who from a group of women with unwanted pregnancies would have gone on to have an abortion had it been available.

However, we are in the unique situation that we cannot test any such study in Ireland.

Irish women, when they go for abortions, are given what is called counselling beforehand, and really, that is a process of informed consent that is common to all medical procedures that are undertaken.  If I start people on medication I would obviously tell them what it is, how it works, what the side-effects would be and what the consequences would be if, for example, they were to get pregnant.  An abortion is like any other medical procedure.  We have to talk about the consequences of having it and the possible risks involved.  Counselling at a more in-depth emotional level is not always, in practice, something that is done.  It will be done, obviously, if there is a need for it.  Irish women who go across to the UK leave within 24 hours of having had the procedure, and they are usually quite unwell, or at least in a very delicate position and situation, and they are in pain.  I guess they do not get counselling before they leave the UK and they do not go back there for counselling.<\/p> <p>  On the GP care that is provided here, GPs provide counselling care but, unfortunately, there is no proper training for abortion care in Ireland.  There is training for the procedures that are used because essentially some forms of surgical abortion are the same as procedures that would be done, for example, for difficult menstruation problems or for retained products of conception, so while there is procedural training, there is not necessarily explicit training in relation to having had an abortion, which is a different emotional issue, obviously, to having the contents of a uterus evacuated.  If we are looking to have abortion services in Ireland, and the Deputy made reference to this, counselling would have to be a part of it, but I do not think it is always necessary.  I do not think women always need counselling.  Some women are quite clear about what they want to do, and it is not necessarily a very complex or a very heartrending difficult problem for them.  Obviously, for a lot of women it is very complicated and where counselling is required it should be, obviously, embedded into services and it needs to be.  There is no specific counselling for such women when they come home, but GPs are very creative and they are used to dealing with this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The second part of the question is related to residents of the UK and a comparison with the support services.

My final point, among many, is if a woman has a miscarriage, very often she requires counselling.

Obviously, as the Deputy said very rightly, miscarriage can be a terrible tragedy for some women, and particularly a late miscarriage is devastating.  If a woman is devastated she will need counselling.  In a similar vein, we may have a woman who had a very early abortion who is not devastated.  All of our medical services and psychiatric services are there to respond to need, so we need to have counselling and psychiatry embedded within our obstetric services, and that is something that is going to happen in the future, but if we are planning to legislate for abortion the Deputy is absolutely correct that we need a model whereby counselling services are available prior to and following procedures.  We should not discriminate between whether that is an abortion or a miscarriage.  There are counselling procedures in place for women who have late miscarriages or stillbirths.  They are established in the three maternity hospitals.  We need to expand the range of counselling services for abortion and earlier miscarriages.

I cannot represent my profession before the committee today; I am simply an individual.  However, there are general principles that apply to this as they apply to all of medicine, and it is worth repeating them.<\/p> <p>  Risk is unpredictable, especially risk where someone is in a situation of extreme emotional vulnerability.  Such a woman is vulnerable because she is pregnant and because she has an unwanted pregnancy.  If she is looking for abortion care, she is vulnerable because she is going down a pathway in which she will absolutely need support, although it is an autonomous decision.  Such a woman ought to have care provided to her on that journey, including counselling and care for whatever other psychological requirements she may have.  We need a framework that is not restrictive - that is the main principle.  We need something that will allow clinicians to practise flexible best practices.  A clinician cannot practice good medicine with a document like the one in my hand standing over her.  A clinician cannot practice good medicine by saying to a woman in every second sentence that she can do something but she should bear in mind that there is a constitutional prohibition.  A clinician working in a very circumscribed and highly legalised area where she has to get three, four or five opinions is the polar opposite to what we require.  For doctors to practise, we need the prohibition to be removed from the Constitution.  We need repeal of the eighth amendment.  Then, we need flexible legislation that will reflect the unpredictability and unforeseeable situations that arise in clinical practice.<\/p> <p>  Pathways cannot be exact.  The idea that a woman can walk into any psychiatrist or doctor and then be referred to three specialists within 24 hours and have a legal termination within a few days does not work.  It simply does not work like that.  We must have a legal framework that will free us and liberate us to practise medicine and psychiatry.  At the moment we are working against obstacles.

The whole trajectory of the family life is changed as well, and that is a tragedy.  What we want to do is, as Hippocrates said, prevent unnecessary suffering.  Yet, we are creating unnecessary suffering in trying to work within the system that we are working within at the moment.  It is creating unnecessary suffering in women.<\/p> <p>  Women are sitting in airports feeling the shame.  I believe we all feel the shame, as I said in my opening statement.  I think it is shameful too.  One thing will always remain with me.  I recall when I walked through an outpatient clinic.  RTE Radio was reporting there on the tribunal into the care that Savita Halappanavar had received in University Hospital Galway.  I was absolutely shocked and terribly distressed to hear the RTE presenter talking about intimate gynaecological details in a room full of patients.  There were so many levels to it.  On one level I was the doctor and the patients knew I was the doctor.  At that level there was violation of the sacred trust between doctor and patient.  It was violation of the most intimate of intimate things that many women would not share with a best friend, mother or sister.  Yet it was there being broadcast.  We were listening to all of that &ndash; I think that is shameful.<\/p> <p>  We need to move it from a legal constitutional framework into a medical clinic, which is where it belongs.  Stigma is a really important mental health issue and is central in the whole problem that this committee is trying to resolve.  I wish the committee members all the very best in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>We still have next week &ndash; we are not finished yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#P00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly covered some of what I wanted to ask, so I will be quick.

We cannot support them in this area because we are prohibited from doing so.  We are prohibited from doing so because there is a constitutional ban on abortion.  We are legally prohibited from doing it because it is against the law, with a sentence of up to 14 years applying.

The line that resonates with me most is the one she repeated a moment ago to the effect that the mental health of everybody in Ireland is being damaged by the eight amendment.  I remember campaigning against the amendment in 1983.  We need to remember that, at that time, the State was still locking women up when they were pregnant.  They were being locked up in the Good Shepherd Convent in Limerick, next door to where I lived when I was a student.  Those were the times in which we lived.  This amendment is a vestige of that dark culture of hiding everything away, particularly in the context of women.  That is the end of the speech.<\/p> <p>  We heard about rogue agencies, counselling agencies that were not actually offering non-directive counselling but counselling to persuade women one way, namely, to not have terminations.

The Senator raises a very important point, namely, that counselling in this area should be completely non-directive.  We should support whatever a woman wants to do.  The trickiest situations are those in which women do not know what they want to do.  They continue through with the pregnancy feeling ambivalent and wondering if they will want the child when it is born.  The more ambivalence that is there, the more support women need.  We need to direct a considerable amount of our mental health resources to the area of unwanted pregnancies.  If women choose to have abortions, that resolves the issue, if the Senator sees what I mean.  The situation we are in now, whereby women who choose that they do not want to have a baby and they cannot have a baby, creates a whole set of problems.  Non-directive counselling within a framework where we have abortion services available is definitely at the heart of good practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Keane for her presentation.  We meet again; we soldiered during the debate in advance of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill in 2013.<\/p> <p>  One could argue that life is never black and white; it is grey and messy.  Human relationships are complex and all of that.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act exists because of a very blunt instrument in the middle of the Constitution, that is, the eighth amendment.  During the debates that resulted in the passage of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, some outlandish claims were made to the effect that there would be queues of women claiming to be suicidal in order to try to procure abortions.  Some of the insinuations in that debate were quite hurtful.<\/p> <p>  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act introduced monitoring systems.  In 2015, a total of 14 terminations were carried out under the Act because of a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman due to physical illness.  There were nine emergency terminations carried out due to an immediate risk to the life of the woman because of physical illness and there were three because of suicidal intent.  Would the professor agree that because only three terminations were carried out in 2015 on foot of suicidal intent, it is clear that many distressed women are still going abroad in very agitated states?  From a clinical point of view, where does that leave psychiatrists, psychologists, GPs and clinicians in general in terms of allowing a patient with her files under her arm and in a very distressed state to go an airport and travel abroad to have a termination carried out in another jurisdiction?  Where does that leave Professor O'Keane and her colleagues in terms of their ability to care for a patient, either in advance or on her return?  Does it put them in a very difficult position in that they cannot counsel or advise patients that a termination may resolve their suicidal intent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Q00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  He is absolutely right.  There have been three annual reports following the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act showing that three women with suicidal intent had the procedure in 2014, three in 2015 and one in 2016.  I might have mentioned earlier that my view is that the women who are suicidal and who can travel are going to England.  Why would they not?  Why would anybody with the means stay here to be subjected to an inquisition before three specialists.  Senior specialists are intimidating people.  They usually do not live in the same place.  They are interrupting their normal routine and such appointments will not usually be during working hours.  It is a very difficult process.  Why would people subject themselves to that when they can go to the UK?  Going to the UK is shameful but a woman subjecting herself to that sort of repeated questioning is soul-destroying and humiliating.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right; many women are saying, \"I'm distressed and potentially suicidal if I don't get this abortion.  I'm leaving; I'm out of here.\"  It is the women who cannot travel who become suicidal because they cannot do so.

It is unpredictable because risk can change very quickly.  I have outlined - I do not want to repeat too much - that women who are pregnant are vulnerable emotionally, because of what is happening to them but also because physiologically the gestational hormones alter the emotional centres in one's brain.  Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms are much more common, even from women who do not suffer from depression, when women are pregnant.  There is this vulnerable background.  In such situations, what might not be something tremendously challenging can become something tremendously challenging.  Amplification can occur in terms of emotional responses.  Psychiatric presentations can be unpredictable and unforeseeable and that is because of the nature of the pregnant female brain.  We need to allow for that.  That is why I really liked the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Although almost 100% - it was 95% - recommended that abortion be available for women who are at risk of suicide, almost 80% stated that abortion should be available for women whose health was at risk so that the range between the highest risk and the lowest risk was only 20%.  That is a narrow range.  That reflects the unforeseeable fluctuations that can occur.  Risk cannot be gauged rigidly.  It cannot be fixed.  That is important for the legislators to understand in terms of mental health problems that might arise.<\/p> <p>  The second issue Deputy Rabbitte asked about was maternal mental health.  I guess it is broader than maternal mental health services.  It is women's mental health because if women choose to have abortions then it is not really maternal mental health.  We need to see women's mental health.  The National Women's Council of Ireland has been lobbying for this for quite a long time.  Its phrase is gender-sensitive mental health services or health services.  That is a very good way of looking at it because there are some issues that are very sensitive to one's gender.  Of course, reproductive health care is one of those areas.  The services are bad at present but clinicians and the leaders within the health care systems are all working hard to improve services and to improve the delivery of services.  I suppose the national maternity strategy has had a sluggish start with a little bit of remonstrating, but the mental health services are very much an intrinsic part of the services that will be developed now.<\/p> <p>  In psychiatry as well, there is the area of perinatal psychiatry.  I do not want to go into Dr. Anthony McCarthy's territory.  He will be talking about that and I do not want to duplicate any information that the committee might be given.  Dr. McCarthy will address that for the committee in a fuller sense.

I am a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Rotunda Hospital but have been invited before this committee in my capacity as medical director of the hospital's sexual assault treatment unit, SATU, as well as the national sexual assault treatment unit.  As we know, sexual violence occurs in all cultures and countries, with a range of epidemiological studies recording a far higher prevalence than previously thought.  There is no \"typical victim\"; there is no \"typical scenario\".  In the Irish context, as summarised in the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report, of which there has been much discussion in recent weeks, more than four in ten or 42% of women have reported some form of sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime.  The most serious form of abuse, penetrative abuse, was experienced by 10% of women.<\/p> <p>  We know that disclosure of sexual violence enables the patient to get access to the medical and psychological care that they need, as well as facilitating commencement of a judicial investigation if the person chooses to engage with the criminal justice system.  Both national and international data, however, highlight that for a broad range of reasons including self-blame, shame, fear of judgment and lack of information, many people who experience sexual violence never tell anyone about it.  Almost half of those who disclosed a history of sexual abuse or assault in the SAVI survey, for example, had never previously disclosed it to anyone.  Notwithstanding that, if someone is going to disclose sexual violence, it is very important to facilitate them to do so as soon as possible after the incident.  Doing so enables appropriate provision of care, as well as the collection of relevant forensic evidence, including DNA evidence.  It is hoped that provision of early responsive care may reduce the short-term and long-term physical and psychological effects of sexual violence.<\/p><p>To respond to this need, this country has six sexual assault treatment units, SATUs, to provide care to men and women over the age of 14 years who disclose sexual violence.  These are located in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Mullingar, Galway and Letterkenny and they aim to provide responsive care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In addition there is a service in Limerick which provides out-of-hours care only.  Each SATU is staffed by clinical nurse and midwife specialists and doctors trained in sexual assault forensic examination.  Since 2009, we have collated national data for key service activities within the SATU.   In 2016 more than 700 men and women attended SATU services.<\/p><p> SATU staff work collaboratively with allied agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Forensic Science Ireland, Rape Crisis Centres and Rape Crisis Network Ireland, paediatric forensic medical services and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who together form the sexual assault response services.  This group has developed national guidelines and aims to provide responsive patient care as espoused by our mission, vision and working philosophy.<\/p><p> As with my presentation to the Citizens' Assembly earlier in 2017, I am not presenting anonymised cases to assist deliberation and discussion.  While any cases we discuss would be anonymous to us, a survivor of sexual violence may recognise themselves in the scenario and in that context they may feel re-victimised.  For this reason I offer a fact-based overview and I will address questions.<\/p><p> When a patient discloses a recent incident of sexual violence and wishes to receive care in this regard, they have three options, which are explained to the patient in detail, and informed consent is obtained.  Option number one allows access to prompt and thorough investigation of the incident and is most frequently chosen.  This involves the patient reporting the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who brings them to a SATU.  The patient receives comprehensive medical care, including preventative treatment for infectious diseases and emergency contraception, psychological and forensic care from the allied rape crisis centre.  Injuries are documented and treated and appropriate intimate and non-intimate samples are taken.<\/p><p> If the person chooses not to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not to report the incident, he or she can attend the SATU to avail of a health check.  In that context the person can still receive medical care, including emergency contraception and infectious disease prophylaxis.  He or she can also receive psychological care, but without reporting the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the person chooses this option and subsequently changes their mind, the opportunity to take time-sensitive forensic samples may have passed, which could compromise potential prosecution.  Because of Children First guidelines this option is only available to those persons over the age of 18.  Because the opportunity to take forensic samples may be lost when a person chooses to not report, in 2016 we introduced the option of storage of evidence.  Again, this is for patients over 18 years of age who are undecided whether or not to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They receive a health check and medical in the SATU, forensic samples are taken and stored within the SATU for a period of up to one year.  With this option patients will also receive emergency contraception.<\/p><p> It is clear from this summary of care options that regardless of which option the patient chooses in terms of reporting the incident, she will be offered emergency contraception, which is successful in preventing pregnancy in the majority of patients if provided within the appropriate timeframe.  I have included a table in my written statement that highlights the efficacy of the available contraceptives with up to 99% of pregnancies being prevented when emergency contraception is given in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> All patients who attend SATUs are then offered a series of follow-up appointments, to provide ongoing support and to undertake sexually transmitted diseases, STI, screening, pregnancy testing and to meet any other needs as required.  All of the women will have been offered emergency contraception and it is thus rare that we confirm a pregnancy at a follow-up visit, however up to one third of our patients do not attend for these reviews.  The follow-up data, including on pregnancy, on some who attend SATU services is incomplete.<\/p><p> While pregnancy after rape is infrequently encountered in those who attend SATU services, the extrapolated rape-related pregnancy rate is 5%.  This estimate results from a three year survey of over 4,000 women regarding the prevalence and incidence of rape and related physical and mental health outcomes.  This study was published more than 20 years ago, but in broad terms the figure is consistent with recent data from Rape Crisis Network Ireland, which was presented at the Citizens' Assembly, and also consistent with data that Ms Noeline Blackwell will present today.<\/p><p> An individual&rsquo;s pregnancy risk will, of course, be influenced by the time in the menstrual cycle at which the incident occurred as well as other variables.  While it is reassuring that few pregnancies occur in the population who attend SATU services for care, women do become pregnant after sexual violence either because they did not disclose the incident and thus did not receive emergency contraception or because they received emergency contraception and it failed.  Studies have identified that women who become pregnant after sexual violence may only present after the first trimester of pregnancy, during the second trimester.  This limits options in terms of decision making with regard to continuing the pregnancy.<\/p><p> In 2015, 5% of women attending an Irish Rape Crisis Centre reported that they became pregnant as a result of rape.  The majority went on to give birth and parent but other outcomes included miscarriage, stillbirth, adoption and fostering and termination of pregnancy.  As the committee is aware, termination of pregnancy for a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape is currently only available in this country if there is a substantial risk to her life, including risk of suicide, which can only be averted by termination of pregnancy.  Under-disclosure of sexual violence, however, is common so it is very likely that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual violence in the State are represented in the population who travel for termination of pregnancy in another jurisdiction or in the population who access Mifepristone or Misoprostal online.<\/p><p> It must also be emphasised that it would not be appropriate to mandate that these women would be obliged to report the details and circumstances of this incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other regulatory third party if termination became available in this jurisdiction, prior to being approved for termination of pregnancy.<\/p><p> Finally, it is vital to remember that even in the context of intimate examination by trained personnel, there is no physical finding that conclusively demonstrates that unwanted sexual contact has occurred.  Published and peer reviewed literature - of which there is much - shows that the presence and pattern of injuries sustained during a sexual assault can show considerable variation ranging from a complete absence of injuries, which is most frequently seen, to fatal injuries, which thankfully is very rare.  There is a considerable evidence base confirming that genital injury is not an inevitable consequence of sexual assault and that lack of genital injury does not imply consent by the victim and does not imply lack of penetration by the assailant.  Furthermore, the belief that absence of the hymen confirms that there has been penetration of the vagina is incorrect.  Equally false is the suggestion that a normal or intact hymen means that penetration has not occurred.  In support of this, for example, one paper reviewed examination findings in a group of pregnant adolescents and identified that despite definitive evidence of sexual contact having occurred - all these adolescents were pregnant - only 2 of 36 adolescents had genital changes that were diagnostic of penetrating trauma.  From the physical perspective, therefore, there is no conclusive test that women who are pregnant after rape could or should be subjected to.<\/p><p> In summary, holistic, patient-focused services for women who have experienced sexual crime mean that pregnancy as a result of rape is infrequently encountered by those of us who work in SATU services.  Therefore, in addition to the other health, forensic and societal benefits of reporting sexual crime, in terms of pregnancy prevention it is imperative that people are encouraged and enabled to disclose acutely in order that they can receive appropriate care including emergency contraception, which works very well.<\/p><p> With regard to access to termination of pregnancy on the grounds that the pregnancy was conceived through sexual violence, it is important to acknowledge that very many women do not wish to report that rape has occurred, and should not be mandated to do so.  Furthermore, even if disclosure does occur I must reiterate the absence and inappropriateness of any single conclusive test which could be used to either confirm or refute the disclosure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve Eogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Eogan.

I am the chief executive of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and I am joined today by my colleague Ms Angela McCarthy who is our head of clinical services.<\/p> <p>  A slightly longer paper of our presentation was submitted to the committee and I will now give an edited version of that - a readers' digest version.  Our purpose is to give members evidence as based on the experience of our personnel and the analysis of our own data on the impact of pregnancy where it happens as a result of rape of women.<\/p> <p>  Our data comes from the 24 hour helpline that we run from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and from clients that we see face to face.<\/p><p>We support those attending Dr. Eogan's sexual assault treatment unit.  We also accompany people to police stations and court.<\/p><p> Over the last number of years, approximately 80% of callers to the national 24-hour helpline were women.  Callers to the helpline may not disclose their age at all but of the approximately 12,400 calls we got in 2016 whose age was known, 40% were women under 50 and 44% were women under 60.  In terms of people coming directly to our doors, about 90% of those who attended for face-to-face therapy were women, and 80% of the 500 we saw were women under 50 while 89% were under 60.<\/p><p> While rape is about abuse of power, and violence, it does not always require force.  Many rapes do involve force but many also happen when a person feels compelled to have non-consensual sex through external or societal pressures.  Where sexual intercourse happens without consent, it is rape.  Our therapists and helpline counsellors bear witness to the trauma, hurt and harm of rape every day.  The psychological impact of rape can include self-blame, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, flashbacks, sleep or eating disorders, distrust of others and feelings of personal powerlessness.  Women may experience none, some or all of those at different times.  Those impacts are not signs of illness, deficiency or weakness in a woman, nor are they characteristics of a particular woman, they are responses to traumatic events and trauma is real.  In the experience of our personnel, the trauma of rape is exacerbated for those who become pregnant as a result of the rape.<\/p><p> I will say a little about how women present to us generally.  Dr. Eogan has said from her perspective, and we can say from our experience, there is no such thing as a \"normal\" response to rape.  Rape impacts on everyone differently depending not just on the circumstances of the rape but on the person themselves.  The immediate aftermath of a rape can vary.  It can be a time of overwhelming turmoil and confusion where a victim or survivor feels extreme and conflicting emotions.  Some people present as numb, quiet and reserved.  Others will respond quite differently being distraught, anxious, or hostile.  The effects of the trauma can be short term or they can last long after the rape.<\/p><p> I will not speak about the experience of our volunteers in the sexual assault treatment unit because Dr. Eogan has covered that ground but there is some discussion of how our volunteer counsellors work with women who attend there.  On the national 24-hour helpline, we aim to hold a confidential non-judgmental space for callers where they are empowered to explore their feelings, consider how the rape has impacted on them and make their own decisions about what to do and how to proceed.  We seek to engage the caller and establish whether they are safe, have support or are in need of medical care.<\/p><p> Raising that issue of medical attention can prompt mixed responses.  The possibility of having contracted a sexually transmitted disease or getting pregnant is now something else the woman must consider.  A caller may ask questions related to a possible pregnancy.  These may include questions about termination of a pregnancy.  In those cases, callers to our service are referred on to a service that would be better placed to answer questions and provide information such as a free text number or the Positive Options website.  Calls that relate to pregnancy are not the only ones we refer on.  We also make referrals to other rape crisis centres, domestic violence support agencies, social workers, the Garda, other helplines and the like.  It is important that not only do callers have the correct information but that they understand we are there to support them irrespective of the outcome of their decision about pregnancy.  Such calls tend to finish quite quickly because a pregnancy and the decisions around it are uppermost in the woman's mind.<\/p><p> In terms of face-to-face therapy, clients present with a blend of issues.  Memories of the rape can evoke feelings of shame or betrayal.  There can be terror of the physical hurt, the fear of a violent threat and the possibility of a pregnancy.  The intensity of their feelings can often overwhelm people as they embark on their therapeutic journey.  Some clients will even have difficulty acknowledging the reality of their rape.  Some may only reveal that the rape resulted in pregnancy weeks, months or years later.  A therapist may never hear about the pregnancy at all.  While we note information on those who reveal to us that they have become pregnant we will often only hear about it as a historical event.  The scenarios that we hear about include the following: A client has had a baby as a result of a recent rape.  That can bring conflicting emotions about an innocent child that is born out of aggression and there can be a loving and-or loathing of the child; a client has had a miscarriage and may have a sense of relief that there is not the added dilemma of being pregnant but there may be a sense of loss of a baby; a client may present as being pregnant and unsure what she is going to do.  The pregnancy presents a double crisis - on top of the rape and trauma they also face the additional crisis of pregnancy and a decision in relation to that.  They have to work through the practical, financial and emotional difficulties in proceeding with an unplanned pregnancy or having an abortion.  The client will have to assess that in terms of all existing relationships within her family and her community; and, a client may present as having had an abortion.  She may feel relief that there is not the added dilemma of being pregnant.  Some feel a sense of guilt and sadness at having terminated the pregnancy.  Others feel stigma, shame and isolation.  The secrecy surrounding the abortion presents a burden for some.  Some will feel anger that they could not have the abortion procedure in Ireland, travel having made the whole process expensive, complicated and traumatic; a client may have had a baby as a result of a historic rape.<\/p><p> In 2016, 11 women disclosed pregnancies as a result of rape to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  We noted the outcomes for those 11 women.  Four had become pregnant and were parenting; three had terminations; one had miscarried; one had a child adopted; one had a child fostered and in one case the outcome was unknown.  Those figures do not indicate a victim or survivor's choice, but merely the ultimate outcome.  The figures may relate to recent or historic pregnancies.<\/p><p> There is no reliable Irish information available about the prevalence of pregnancy as a result of rape because there is such massive under-reporting of rape.  Dr. Eogan referred to the 2002 SAVI report, which found that 42% of women reporting abuse had never told anyone at all.  Only 8% of women reported their experience of sexual violence to the Garda; 6% disclosed to medical professionals and 14% of women in that survey reported to counsellors.  Other studies give comparable results.<\/p><p> In 2014 an EU survey undertaken by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, FRA, found that about 2% of women aged 18 and 74 experienced sexual violence in the previous 12 months.  From our own evidence, most rape and serious sexual violence is perpetrated by someone known to the victim.  Our statistics for 2016 identified that just under 17% of adult rape and sexual assault was perpetrated by the client's spouse or partner, 2% by other family members and almost 46% by other known persons.  That includes friends, recent dates, work mates and the like.  About 50% of childhood sexual abuse revealed to us by adults was perpetrated by a family member.<\/p><p> We have no reliable national data on the prevalence of pregnancy as a result of rape.  However, from our own statistics over 11 years, and also using the statistics from the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland, RCNI, which collects data from a number of other smaller rape crisis centres, it seems that approximately 4% of the total number of female victims or survivors who presented to rape crisis centres report pregnancies as a result of rape.  That is very near the 5% Dr. Eogan spoke about in other surveys.  Of that 4%, a little over one third of our clients went on to parent while a little less than one third terminated their pregnancy.  The RCNI figures show almost half went on to parent, while just under 20% terminated their pregnancy.<\/p><p> The final point relates to concerns about women's health if rape must be reported to access abortion, the so-called rape exception.  If the committee is considering special provisions for those who have suffered rape to access termination, then it seems inevitable that the pregnant rape victim or survivor will have to say that a rape occurred.<\/p><p>Many of those who contact us are not ready to report to police for a long time, if ever.  It is noteworthy that the Garda now provides storage of forensic evidence at the sexual assault treatment unit for up to a year, recognising the realities of the investigation of this type of crime.  Clients are sometimes fearful of the reality that once they report to the Garda, garda&iacute; must commence the investigation of a crime, thus notifying the alleged perpetrator of the complaint even if the victim is not ready.  They may also initially have concerns about their own blame for the events which makes them reluctant to speak.  Clients may not be ready to report to a doctor, social worker or the like.  They may not want to talk to someone they fear will judge them and who must judge them to some extent.  In the context of the long journey our clients and callers must take to re-build their self-esteem and manage their self-doubt after the violence of rape, many would be set back if questions were raised about their credibility.<\/p><p> Requiring a woman to share such a traumatising experience about her rape and subsequent pregnancy has the potential to not only re-traumatise, re-trigger and re-victimise her, it also leaves her in a situation where she has to convince someone that her story justifies access to support.  It disempowers the person who has suffered the rape while empowering the person giving permission to access a procedure or service.  Once more, the consent of the victim or survivor is seen as irrelevant.  I am happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>We will now have a presentation from Mr. Tom O'Malley, BL.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#W00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The purpose of this presentation is to identify or explore some legal issues that may arise in the event that it is seriously being considered to have rape as a ground on which abortion or a termination of pregnancy might be granted.  I am not really concerned with or in a position to address the more normative or policy question as to whether rape should in fact be a ground for abortion.  My purpose is simply to explore some of the legal issues that would arise if that were seriously being considered.  As such, there are two broad questions to be addressed.  First, one must address what exactly is meant by \"rape\" in this context.  In other words, what range of offences might justify granting a termination?  The second and perhaps more difficult question is what kind or level of proof might be required where someone seeks an abortion on the grounds that she had become pregnant as the result of a criminal offence.<\/p> <p>  As to the range of offences, there are obviously now a very large number of sexual offences known to Irish law, most of which are defined in a gender-neutral way.  For practical purposes here, we are only concerned with those offences involving heterosexual intercourse, as they are clearly the only ones that might result in pregnancy.  We are not just talking about rape, which I will explain in a moment, we are also talking about sexual intercourse with an under age female, namely someone under the age of 17; sexual intercourse between a person in authority and a female aged between 17 and 18 years; sexual intercourse with a female who has a mental disability or learning difficulty; and, finally, incest.  All of those offences may be quite familiar in legal terms to members of the committee as most of them were redefined or in some cases created by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year.<\/p> <p>   I start with rape itself, which is probably the most relevant offence for present purposes.  It is important to mention the definition of rape, which has three components.  First, sexual intercourse must take place.  The defendant must have intentionally had sexual intercourse with the complainant and it must also be proved that the complainant did not at the time consent.  It must also be proved that the defendant knew that she was not consenting or was reckless in that regard.  As such, two of the key elements of rape are the absence of consent on the part of the complainant and knowledge on the part of the defendant that she was not, in fact, consenting.<\/p> <p>  As I have set out in a bit more detail in the paper I submitted to the committee, the law on consent changed as a result of the 2017 Act which included, for the first time, a statutory definition of consent in Irish law as far as sexual offences are concerned.  It is now the law that a person consents to a sexual act only if he or she freely and voluntarily agrees to that act.  The relevant section then sets out a range of circumstances in which, as a matter of law, a person will be held not to have consented.  It is very important also that the mental element, as we call it, or culpability be considered because a man will not be guilty of rape unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he either knew the woman was not consenting or was reckless in that regard.  It is very often said that a man has a defence if he can show that he thought the woman was consenting but that is not, in fact, the law.  The defendant does not have to prove anything.  It is always up to the prosecution to prove all of the elements of the offence, including the absence of belief on his part.  They are the essential elements of rape as it is currently defined.  It is also important to note that since 1990 there has been no ambiguity but that rape can occur within marriage.  A husband may be convicted of raping his wife.  The definition is the same and the maximum sentence, which is life imprisonment, is also the same.<\/p> <p>  The law relating to sexual acts with a person under the age of 17 years was changed somewhat earlier this year.  In the old days, we used to call those offences \"unlawful carnal knowledge\", but as a result of a Supreme Court decision in 2006, which struck down the old law, we have had to amend the law on a number of occasions since.  In essence, it works as follows.  There are two separate offences involved which are differentiated according to the age of the young person.  It is an offence punishable with up to life imprisonment to have sexual intercourse, among other acts, with a person under the age of 15 years.  That is the more serious of the offences.  Consent on the part of the young person provides no defence whatsoever to the male or perpetrator in question, but a defendant has a defence if he can prove that he was reasonably mistaken as to the age of the young person.  If he reasonably thought she was over 15, he is not guilty of that particular offence.<\/p> <p>  Section 17 of the 2017 Act creates a separate offence of sexual intercourse with a person, or female in the context of the committee's deliberations, under the age of 17 years.  That is regarded as a less serious offence in the sense that the maximum sentence varies depending on a number of circumstances.  It is not life imprisonment as it is in the case of the other offence.  Again, the accused person has a defence if he can show that he thought on reasonable grounds the young woman was over 17 years.  However, the question of consent then arises and the situation becomes a little more complicated as a result of changes made to the legislation earlier this year.  That might be relevant to the present discussion.  At one time, consent was simply not a defence in those circumstances.  If the young person was under 17, consent was no defence.  However, we introduced a significant change to that earlier this year.  Consent on the part of the young person can now be a defence to the male provided he was either younger than the female in question or he is less than two years older than her.  To give a practical example, if the girl is 16 years of age and consents to the intercourse and the male in question was 15, 16 or 17, no offence has been committed.  On the other hand, if he was 19 years of age, an offence has been committed irrespective of whether she consented or not because he is more than two years older than her.  It is important to be aware of that.<\/p> <p>  The next sexual offence to take into account is a completely new offence created by the 2017 Act, namely a sexual act with a person who is between 17 and 18 years of age committed by a person in authority.  We never had such an offence in Ireland before.  In effect, it raises the age of consent to 18 years but only in circumstances where the person who has intercourse with the young person is, in some sense, in authority over him or her as the case may be.  A \"person in authority\" is defined in the Act and includes, for example, a teacher, a guardian, an employer, a parent, obviously, or a close relative.<\/p> <p>  The next offence the committee needs to consider is another one which was completely revamped and redefined in the 2017 Act.  This is a sexual act with a protected person, namely a person of any age who has a mental illness or mental disability.<\/p><p>It has long been the law, only that it was amended somewhat this year, that it should be a criminal offence for a man to have sexual intercourse with a woman who has a mental disability of a certain kind.  Now this is defined in a gender-neutral way.  We now define a protected person as someone who by reason of mental or intellectual disability or mental illness is incapable of understanding the nature and the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the act or incapable of evaluating the relevant information.  Again, this offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>Incest, of course, is still an offence in this country.  Irish law is special in this regard.  Ireland was not historically unique in this regard, but incest in this country is committed not just when one of the parties is a minor, but also when people who are, let us say, brother and sister, mother and son, or father and daughter, have heterosexual intercourse, irrespective of age.  This provides a role in preventing child abuse if one of the parties is under age, but incest can equally be committed, for example, by two siblings who are well into adulthood and who consent to the act in question and even in circumstances where there would not be any danger of pregnancy to begin with.  Again, this is the kind of thing the committee would have to take into account.  This is the range of sexual offences in this country, so one of the questions the committee should ask for present purposes is, which of these offences, if any, might provide on policy grounds a justification for allowing termination of pregnancy if one of them were committed.<br\/><br\/>Now I wish to consider the issues of proof that might arise.  There are two questions in this regard.  The first is the one I have just asked, namely, what range of offences should be taken into account, to what extent and so forth.  Next is the question of proof.  If a woman comes forward seeking a termination on the grounds that one of these offences has been committed, what kind of proof should be required?  This question is linked into the broader policy on abortion that might be adopted by this committee or eventually by the Oireachtas generally.  In other words, if it were ultimately decided that abortion should be available on a wide variety of grounds or freely available for the first three months or whatever it might be, what I am talking about would probably be irrelevant in the sense that the reason for seeking the abortion simply would not arise.  However, what I am talking about would become relevant if the ultimate decision taken by the Oireachtas was to the effect that unborn life should still be protected but that abortion should be available on a range of grounds, including rape and sexual offences.  If the latter approach were taken, issues of proof would arise.  It is only on the assumption that this is a possibility that I raise this issue at all.<br\/><br\/>One could see the various possibilities regarding proof as being arranged along a spectrum.  At one end of the spectrum is, let us say, a position whereby nothing short of a criminal conviction by a court would suffice to prove that the rape has been committed.  At the other end of the spectrum, a simple assertion or claim by the woman in question that she has been raped or subject to another offence could suffice.  The former is out, to be quite honest, simply because, given the length of time it takes to process a case through the system, apart altogether from what my two colleagues have said, with which I absolutely agree, that is, that many people do not report cases for quite a long time anyway, it would not even arise.  However, even if the woman were to report the case at the very first opportunity, there is no way the criminal case would be concluded within nine months, which is the very maximum period we are talking about.<br\/><br\/>At the other end of the spectrum, there is the possibility of simply asking why we do not simply believe what the person says.  This is a perfectly legitimate approach as well.  I can see many circumstances in which it might not be problematic.  In a so-called stranger rape case where the woman has been not just raped but also seriously assaulted in other ways and she goes to the Garda immediately, perhaps to the sexual assault unit, and to a rape crisis centre, no one would seriously question whether she is the victim of a rape.  Therefore, I do not see any difficulty in accepting such an assertion backed up by such evidence.<br\/><br\/>However, if this were to become an issue at all, the kind of scenario on which the committee would have to concentrate would be one in which, let us say, a woman comes forward, perhaps two or three months, perhaps more, into a pregnancy and claims at that point that she has been raped or is the victim of another offence.  Would proof be required at that point and, if so, what kind of proof?  Of course, the fact that she might come forward at that point does not mean that she is to be disbelieved.  On the contrary, as we know from experience, many people who are the subject of rape or child abuse choose not to report for all the kinds of reasons Ms Blackwell has mentioned.  However, if they discover subsequently that they are pregnant, at that point they may come forward and say they have been raped.  At that point there may not be any forensic evidence that would be of any use for the purpose of proving the rape has been committed.  Therefore, the question would arise of what kind of proof would be required, given that a criminal trial is out.<br\/><br\/>Some kind of inquiry or body could be set up, on either an <i>ad hoc<\/i>or a permanent basis, to assess such claims.  Again, questions would arise.  Would it be necessary to identify the perpetrator?  Would the perpetrator have a right to be heard?  Suppose, for example, a woman says she has been raped by her husband or partner.  Would he have the right to come forward and say it was not rape and that he objects to the abortion taking place?  Would that end up in court?  Of course, it would in those circumstances.  These are the kinds of issues the committee might need to consider.<br\/><br\/>I have gone over time.  I think I have already dealt with the sexual offences other than rape that might become an issue.  One of the questions the committee must ask is if abortion were allowed to take place in respect of these offences, would it only be allowed where a criminal offence has taken place?  A criminal offence might not always have taken place in the case of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 17 because, as I said, sometimes that is criminal and sometimes it is not, depending on the age of the male involved.  For example, would the right to a termination be granted to everyone under the age of 17 who becomes pregnant or would it be confined to cases in which a criminal offence has been committed?<br\/><br\/>I do not wish to give the impression from what I have said so far that there would be insuperable difficulties in proving rape where some time had elapsed.  I have been examining what happens in other countries in this regard, including many European countries.  Various countries, parts of the United States and so on provide for access to abortion on the grounds of rape.  It is not an issue in many of these jurisdictions because many of them also provide for a general right to termination within the first few months of pregnancy in any event.  Elsewhere there seems to be general acceptance that requiring a criminal conviction would be largely impossible because of time constraints, so some jurisdictions have provisions to the effect that abortion is permitted where there are strong grounds for believing the pregnancy is the result of a criminal act.  In other words, they do not require absolute proof but they normally require evidence that the person has, for example, reported the matter to the police or a doctor or whatever else.<br\/><br\/>They are the main issues I wished to raise.  When I addressed the Citizens' Assembly, as my colleagues did, I had been asked to say something about the sentencing of serious sex offences, the reason being that some people had quite legitimately asked, if we had a different sentencing system, whether that might reduce the incidence of sexual offences.  The answer, to be honest, is no.  I have included at the end of my written submission an appendix setting out the observations I made at the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Malley and the other witnesses for their presentations.

I was struck by something he said, which is that we are all wanted by somebody.  Similarly, Pam Stenzel recognised that her birth mother gave her life instead of aborting her.  People like Ryan and Pam say they feel like second-class citizens when the question of abortion on grounds of rape arises, when they are made to feel as though there is no value on their lives before birth because of a crime committed by somebody else.  How are they supposed to feel that they matter the same as others after birth?  What would Ms Blackwell say to Ryan and Pam if they were in this room today?  How would she reassure them that their lives were as valuable as anyone else's if the eighth amendment was removed, and abortion was allowed on grounds of rape?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Y01100","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":541,"content":"<p>To be clear, I am speaking here on behalf of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.

Do the witnesses have a view on that?  Somebody has asked about the issue of decriminalisation at nearly all of our meetings.  How does the experience for women who have to go to England and are effectively described as criminals affect people?<\/p> <p>  Some statistics were given by the Rape Crisis Network to the Citizens' Assembly.  To respond to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I think the percentage who went on and completed their pregnancies was as high as those who had a termination.  I am not sure if it is the same in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  In effect, what we are discussing here is options rather than forced terminations.  I know a judgmental question was asked of the witnesses there but it is important to state that we are not saying the witnesses would force anyone to have a termination.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Malley elaborate on other countries?  He was saying that in countries where there is not a general right to access early termination, in some cases, one has to prove it which does not work because of the time the court case takes.

Firstly would be the patient's disclosure and history of what happened.  There may be corroborative evidence such as from CCTV.  There may be forensic evidence from the samples that we take and the tests that we do that confirms that sexual intercourse has occurred.  However, there is not a specific test that can be done that absolutely confirms that the sexual intercourse was unwanted.  Anecdotally, if one asks people, they will say that it is surely very clear from examination whether somebody has been raped.  As Ms Blackwell says, the rape does not always involve physical force.  Even if it does involve physical force, because the body is designed to have sexual intercourse, that physical force may not actually cause an injury.<\/p> <p>  That study that looked at pregnant adolescents is really important.  These people were absolutely and definitively pregnant.  There were 36 of them.  Of those 36 women, when they went back and looked at the tests that were done - they had colposcopy because they were adolescents and so there were photographs - they could see if injuries were identified at the time and there were not.  There is huge heterogeneity in whether or not there will be an injury at the time of sexual intercourse when rape happens, and therefore there is not a definitive or conclusive test that can either confirm or refute that the sexual intercourse has been unwanted.  The Garda investigation takes all the different evidence and the court process will have all the witnesses and the standard of proof there is to prove a matter beyond reasonable doubt.  There is no single test we could do if somebody says that she is ten weeks pregnant as a result of rape.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the impact of criminalisation.  There is much discussion about this.  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has absolutely recommended that termination of pregnancy should not be criminal.  The Deputy is right that there is a potentially huge amount of additional stress that is placed on people not just because they travel but because there may be a fear that there may be some kind of criminal accusation visited upon them.  That is a whole source of additional stress.  Ms Blackwell will probably mention, speaking to people after this meeting, that concerns can be raised about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve Eogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I will pick up on that particular point.  The way we collected the evidence that we are presenting here today was by going around to all of our therapists, some of whom have much experience working with us.  They work with the approximately 500 clients we see in the year and on the phone lines.  I set out five scenarios on page 4 of my longer paper to try to identify what they hear from the people who come into us about how they feel about being pregnant as a result of rape.  There is the issue of the crisis of the rape and the crisis of the pregnancy for the person who is pregnant and is unsure of what to do and she is working through a whole set of scenarios, including practical, financial and emotional difficulties, as we put it here.  I think the legal difficulties or criminality of the abortion are not the issues noted by therapists to a great extent for those people.  We definitely come across people who present as having had an abortion and are angry that they could not have had the procedure in Ireland, had to travel and because it was complicated and traumatic for them to have to do that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan is right about the statistics.  We collect statistics from the national helpline, which gives the national figure, and from our own clients.  Those show that over one third are parenting, a little under one third had a termination and the other third have miscarriages or are cases of historic pregnancies where children have been adopted or fostered.  They are likely to be the older ones, people from years ago who come back to us later.  That number is likely to go down.  The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland has collected statistics from between 11 and 15 of the centres over the years including the rural centres to a great extent.  A greater number of those, approximately 49%, are parenting and a little under 20% had terminations so there was a bit of a disparity.  The numbers are still small.  We can only report, as can the other rape crisis centres, on the people who tell us.  Most people may never tell us at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I will answer the question about how other countries approach the matter.  By way of sources of information, the Green Paper on abortion published in 1999 has an appendix which sets out the regime in other European countries, including this question of where it is available on the grounds of rape and the kinds of proof that are required.  That is almost 20 years ago but there was a recent report by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., a usually objective source of information, which looked at abortion laws in European countries which provides some information on that.  The committee must remember that this is the kind of area that changes a lot since countries change their laws over time.  In my research, two things come forward.  Most European countries that allow abortion in these circumstances will have something to the effect of this, from Portuguese law, \"there is serious evidence of a significant indication that pregnancy resulted from rape\".<\/p><p>Likewise, in Germany, if there are serious grounds for the assumption that the pregnancy resulted from rape.  What they are doing there is they are not insisting on anything like legal proof to the extent that would be required by way of criminal or a civil trial but rather some kind of serious grounds.  Again, the question is how those grounds would be established.  Some countries require a report from a prosecutor.  A Polish case recently came before the ECHR.  In Poland, the local prosecutor is entitled to issue a certificate saying that he is satisfied that a rape took place.  In that case, it was what we would call a sexual act with a person under the age of 15.  That would not be the role of a prosecutor within our system.  The equivalent in our system would be for a member of the Garda or a senior Garda officer to have to issue such a certificate.  However, all that goes back to the question of whether, and at what time, the matter had been reported to the Garda to begin with.  It is almost a vicious circle in terms of whether the report has been made and at what point it has been made.  The most difficult scenario would be where a report was not made in the immediate aftermath of the rape or another offence but where it is made several months down the road.  That is all I can glean from the comparative survey I have done of laws in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Will members be mindful when they ask questions that there are three witnesses before us and I do not want to interrupt witnesses?

If we were to legislate for the involvement of the criminal justice system in assessing access to abortion on ground of rape, would this impact on her ability to dispense care without involving the Garda?<\/p> <p>  My final question is to Mr. O'Malley.  He stated in his presentation that in later term pregnancies arising from rape, a balancing of competing interests between the woman and the unborn child is at stake and a legal adjudication may, therefore, be required to judge these interests.  However, if the eighth amendment was repealed and the explicit right to life of the unborn removed from the Constitution, would that balance of competing interests continue to exist in the same manner as he has articulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#AA02000","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>In terms of the care for women, we raise this because of our concern in this regard.  Of the 12,000 calls we took last year, more than 400 were silent calls.  They were people who picked up the phone and were unable to talk to us on day one.  Even saying, \"I will call that number\" or coming in through our door is a big deal for many people.  We are concerned that it can take time.  Some people will report their rape immediately to the Garda and that is fine while others will take a long time to do it.  That is the is the concern we have.  If someone has to self-declare, and even if it is a simple form of self-declaration, someone else has to sign a certificate at the far end of it.  Yet again, the woman has to put herself before someone who has a choice in whether to believe her or not and sign the certificate or not.  This is in the context of people who are traumatised by the rape and whose consent has been taken from them.  This is the essence of what has happened and that is our concern about any form of certification.<\/p><p>If there is an adjudication process many of them will not do it.  They will not be able to do it within the context of a crisis pregnancy.

An examination or some sort of adjudication in that way is not appropriate.  Again, a disclosure makes it difficult for all the reasons that Ms Blackwell has mentioned.<\/p> <p>  In terms of whether options two and three would be precluded from being offered if we had some sort of mandatory reporting, it is because of Children First and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 that those options are available only to those over the age of 18.  I cannot see how it would be appropriate for us to have mandatory reporting to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or some other third party before somebody could be approved for termination of pregnancy.  Even if there was some bizarre scenario where that existed, I believe that would be separate from us being able to offer these options.

Of course, the vast majority of rapes are not reported, which explains the considerable difference between the two.  The figure we should look at is what the conviction rate is for those who are indicted for the offence, that is, those who are tried and prosecuted.  It is quite high.  I am reluctant to mention a figure.  I have Courts Service statistics in front of me but I am not sure if it readily gives that figure.  I believe it is over 60%, and possibly considerably more than 60%.  One of the things that complicates it is that when one is looking at the figures, one has to differentiate between people who are convicted of the offence with which they are charged - rape, for example - and other people who may be acquitted of that offence but convicted of a lesser offence such as sexual assault or another offence of that nature.

In a criminal trial, under the Constitution, the first and foremost consideration is fairness to the accused.  Article 38 of the Constitution says that nobody charged with a criminal offence shall be tried other than \"in due course of law\".  The primary concern of a criminal trial, under our Constitution, is to provide fairness to the accused.  Other people have rights too but the accused is front and centre.  Therefore, the legislation would have to be drawn up in such a way that it did not jeopardise the person's right to a fair trial by, for example, introducing information that could be unduly prejudicial to the accused.

Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was right that we need to contextualise why we are here.  I think we are here discussing this topic because repeatedly it has been shown that Irish people believe that in circumstances where somebody has become pregnant as a result of rape, the person should not be forced to continue with the pregnancy against her will.  That does not, in any way, undermine or devalue the opposite decision made by people who decide to continue with their pregnancy.  It is a case of recognising the other circumstances of people who may be married and have other children and who may have to grapple with issues and the impact on their own mental health of dealing with a pregnancy as a result of rape and who cannot continue with the pregnancy.  It is their rights that we are considering here and time after time, the Irish people have accepted that.  We, as a committee, are considering how to best provide for that situation.  The witnesses have answered that question already.  There is not a chance in hell of doing that by any circumstances requiring any issue of proof.  Even in the most basket case of countries, nobody requires judicial authorisation.  No countries do so, not even ones with restrictive regimes.  Only a handful of countries in Europe require a police report.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses have clearly said, to provide any sort of declaration to anybody constitutes a re-traumatisation of the victim.  Are we not over-complicating things here?  As Mr. O'Malley has said, the issue of proof only comes up if we deal with exceptions-based legislation.  The way most countries in Europe deal with this matter is by making abortion available in the first trimester without any restriction as to the reason and thereafter based on medical grounds.

I do not want to misquote her but my understanding is that prolonging the situation for women seems to be very difficult.  In their experience, do the witnesses see lengthy processes involving verification and validation of a claim as having a negative effect on women's lives?  The longer women are pregnant, the greater the complications that arise in the context of terminations.  It could be argued that if it went on long enough, for example, past 26 weeks, that essentially a woman could be forced to be an incubator for an unwanted pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to a legal case where custody was granted to a rapist in Michigan.  It was reported by the BBC at the start of this month.  A man who raped a 12-year old girl, on his release from prison as a convicted paedophile, gained access and parental rights to the offspring of the crime, the child produced as a result of the rape.  He was committed to prison for his action but his name was added to the birth certificate of the child against the mother's wishes.  Does Mr. O'Malley think there is scope and capacity in Irish law to allow parental access or rights to a convicted rapist father upon his release from prison?  Should he be supported by the State in that capacity, in that he would he have access to children's allowance payments and so forth?  I understand that paternity leave probably would not be a factor unless he got a very short sentence because the timing would not be right.  Theoretically, however, if it was a short sentence, he could potentially apply for two weeks' paternity leave within 26 weeks of the child being born .  I would welcome Mr. O'Malley's views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#DD00600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy O'Connell's question on why one third of people do not come back, we do not know because they do not come back.  From a positive perspective, however, because we give people infectious disease preventative treatment and emergency contraception, hopefully they feel that they have no physical sequelae so they do not need to come back for an STI screen or a pregnancy test.  In reality, their reasons are probably far more complex and include the fear, concern, stress and emotional trauma.  They are able to contact the helpline and access crisis counselling, and, hopefully, are doing that, but it is a hugely stressful event for somebody and it is unfortunate but not surprising that not everybody returns for their follow-up.<\/p> <p>  Second, on whether one would not believe somebody who comes to a sexual assault unit after an incident of sexual violence, that is not our role.  Our role is to support patients when they are there.  It is up the Garda and, ultimately, the criminal justice system to determine whether a crime has occurred and to process that through the courts.  It is up to us to take the evidence, the intimate samples, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot take as part of its detection.  The forensic samples we take and the examination findings that we record all form part of the investigation and then there is also the medical piece that we do at the same time.  It is not for us in the sexual assault treatment unit to be judge and jury for a patient who presents there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that if a verification aspect were to be introduced, it could only prolong the process.  Already, women who, for example, travel from Ireland for termination of pregnancy are more likely to have surgical termination of pregnancy than medical termination because they present later due to the process of having to travel.  One would imagine that if there was a similar verification process, it could delay the termination of pregnancy and, potentially, convert a more physically low-risk instance into a more high-risk instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#DD00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve Eogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy O'Connell&rsquo;s question to me about people on the street.

That was before my time.  We are not clear on the reason for that because we take no position on a person having an abortion.  Everybody who comes to us is treated the same.  Everybody is treated in a non-judgmental way.  There was only one incident of protest.  What we do get is a certain amount of ignorant abuse from people who are on the street and who point or make it a little bit more difficult occasionally for people to come in to us.  I cannot say enough about how difficult it can be for people to take that step through our door, not just the first time but the fifth or the tenth time as well.  People come in despite the fact that they could not possibly be to blame for the rape or sexual violence that has happened to them.  They do blame themselves.  They feel ashamed on occasion and it is hard for them to come in.  It is much harder if there is somebody harassing them or making their lives difficult.  In terms of the verification process, all we can compare it to is the process of being in court.

I imagine the outcome to be that some kind of verification should be required in order to vindicate the rights to life of the unborn.

Perhaps it would be something like what obtains in some European countries, where the test is of whether there is significant evidence or a significant indication that a rape or some other offence has taken place.

It is not that long ago since these myths still existed.<\/p> <p>  How many rape victims would be likely to be able to access their right to an abortion if a rape ground was introduced with some burden of proof?  According to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's stats, only 42% ever speak to anyone at all, never mind reporting to the Garda or another official agency.  Immediately, a large number would not have access.  What are the barriers to people reporting generally?  Is it not the case that many rape victims, particularly young people, can be abused over years before telling anyone?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Malley referred to international research.  From my examination, it is impossible to access an abortion anywhere that just has a rape ground and little else.  In one eight-year period, a state in Mexico did not grant any applications for abortion.  In Poland, where the legislation is similar to the eighth amendment but with a rape ground, it is difficult for anyone to access abortion.  As such, we know the answer to this question already.  We have the proof from other countries.  Perhaps the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has more information on this through its networks, but the only way that people seem to be able to access abortion is upon request from the person herself up to the first trimester or, if there are additional health grounds, later.<\/p> <p>  We already have the concept of deserving and undeserving abortions, but would be get into having deserving and undeserving rapes if we use a rape ground?  There has been much commentary in society of late about how the victim should not have been there and asking why she was in that hotel room, walked home on her own, was drunk, etc.  One could see how some might say that one woman deserves an abortion while another does not.

There is a 4% or 5% pregnancy rate.  The 2002 SAVI report is too old, but it is all that we have.  Only 42% of people ever speak about the rape.  When one woman in the report was asked why she had not told anyone that she had been raped, she said that no one had ever asked her before.<\/p> <p>  One of our concerns, which is shared by our colleague centres, is that only approximately 10% of those who need our services actually access them.  This is without any complication of pregnancy.  Therefore, it is likely that those who are better resourced or have better supports are the people most likely to access us.  We have a concern about people not knowing how to access us.<\/p> <p>  The barriers that the Deputy asked about are long-term abuse and disruption.  Since 75% to 80% of victims and perpetrators know each other, it is disruptive to report.  For example, someone might be reporting her father, husband, long-term partner, boss, etc.  Self-denial of the rape is also a barrier.  It takes a long time.  People phone and tell us that, for example, something happened and they do not know what it was but it was not rape.  It turns out to have been rape, though, only the person was not ready to say it.  Denial can last a long time.<\/p> <p>  Dealing with various authorities can be another barrier.  We have an excellent police service that has been working hard to put in place specialist investigative units, but not all of those are in place yet.  There are patchy reporting skills in the police.  It can be difficult for everyone to understand perfectly how to receive a report of rape.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about someone being deserving.  Once a woman is asked to sign a certificate, her power to say that she was raped is taken away from her.  Someone else has to make a decision about that rape.  We were slow to raise this issue at all.  Traditionally, rape crisis centres are non-judgmental, confidential places that do not speak on these issues.  In the interests of the women who were approaching us, though we felt that we had to ask legislators to think carefully before putting barriers to healing in their way.  This is why we are speaking about the dangers of requiring a woman to get a certificate saying that she was raped signed by someone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#EE01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Does either of the other witnesses wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#FF00100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputy Coppinger said about Poland.

For example, let us consider a minor being the victim of rape.  To my mind, there should not be any failure to report in that kind of situation.  Whether it means better education in schools or for parents or whatever, we need to do that as a matter of urgency.  This is because of the tendency to minimise the act if we allow it to continue the way it is.<\/p><p> My next question relates to a rape victim being pregnant.  If there is no reporting, we cannot do much about it.  The witnesses have referred to advice and so on, but it should be possible not to force the victim to continue with a pregnancy and not to force her not to continue.  There should be some degree of negotiation or discussion with her.<\/p><p> My last question is for Mr. Tom O'Malley.  Is there reluctance by the authorities to take up cases of rape?  I imagine this applies to other committee members as well, but I have put down D&aacute;il questions on numerous occasions asking whether a given line of action was going to be taken in particular circumstances.  Usually, this arises from the mothers of the victims, who have raised the question and are inquiring as to whether there was likely to be a prosecution or whatever.<\/p><p> My next point relating to prosecution is important.  When a case goes to court, is the questioning of the victim not too strenuous?  In some cases the victim may be young or inexperienced.  She may have moderate special needs or may feel completely at sea under the degree of cross-examination applied.  That may leave the victim virtually admitting in some cases that she was the cause of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#FF01900","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Under-reporting of rape is Europe-wide.  It is everywhere we look.  It is one of those areas where people do not report.  This happens for some of the reasons I mentioned before: it is disruptive, and it may involve someone whom the victim knows well.  The victims are not ready to say it because the trauma of the rape often takes time to come through.  There is much discussion in the media at the moment on this.  Our telephone lines are going crazy with people who are, sometimes for the first time, saying that they were victims of rape.  It is something that is hard to do.  We could not agree more with Deputy Durkan on the need for education, better awareness, and recognition that no persons are responsible for a crime that is committed against them.  We certainly agree with Deputy Durkan on the need for decent school programmes.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, in the case of all people who come to our centre, it is entirely their decision as to what they do next.  Actually, more people who have come in to us over the years saying they are pregnant as a result of rape have gone on to parent rather than take terminations.  It is the woman's decision in all cases.  She is the main agent.<\/p> <p>  We could not agree more with Deputy Durkan about cross-examination in court cases.  This can be re-traumatising.  We are hoping the victims' rights directive will help.

Once it gets to the stage of coming into the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the criterion is clear.  At that point, a prosecution will be taken if there is a realistic prospect of conviction.  Sometimes, there can be so-called public interest factors at stake, where, for example, the victim is very young or old or there may be exceptional reasons why a prosecution should not be taken.  Anyway, this is one area where the victims' rights directive mentioned by Deputy O'Brien becomes important, because people are entitled to reasons for decisions why prosecutions were not taken.  There are some circumstances where the giving of reasons can be refused, for obvious reasons.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions has set up a special section within the office to deal with the giving of reasons to persons who are concerned that certain prosecutions were not taken.  There are good developments taking place in that area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about cross-examination.  Certainly, many improvements have been made over the past 25 years or so.  At one time, complainants could be cross-examined quite mercilessly about their sexual experiences with people other than the accused or with the accused.  Now, there are severe restrictions, in that judicial permission is needed to engage in such cross-examination.  In any event, juries nowadays are far less sympathetic to such cross-examination.  They would not necessarily welcome the idea of a complainant being cross-examined in that fashion.  Still, as Deputy Durkan rightly said, there is much thinking to be done about the optimal way of treating complainants, especially people who are vulnerable on the grounds of age, mental incapacity, learning difficulty or whatever.  We have done a lot in that area.  As Ms Blackwell has said, some further valuable innovations were made in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  They have not come into force yet.<\/p> <p>  We all have our own pet topics.  One of my pet topics, which I earnestly urge upon Members of the Oireachtas, is the problem of how the law on sex offences, the entire law on evidence and the way it operates in the trial of sex offences, is now dispersed among at least a dozen statues dating from 1885 up to 2017.  It is something of a maze in which one section from one statute amends another.  There is a crying need for something that many other countries have done, that is to say, produce a single comprehensive sexual offence statute that sets out all the offences.  There are all kinds of little inconsistencies in the statutes at the moment.  For example, rape is governed by a subjective test of liability.  A man is not guilty unless he believed the woman was consenting, whereas in the case of sex with an underage person, the man only has a defence if he was reasonably mistaken.  There are many such inconsistencies.  It would be wonderful if we had a single sex offence statute.  The process of developing that could well provide us with the opportunity to look at the optimal conditions that should govern the trial process.  In other words, it is a chance to examine what should really be in place to facilitate complainants who have problems in respect of age, mental disability or whatever to see the extent to which the existing law copes adequately with those problems.  Then, in the process of reform, we could make any further changes that are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I think most of the questions have been asked already, so I am not going to go back over them.

All 16 rape crisis centres, operating within their own geographic areas nationally and collaborating where necessary and possible, lost huge amounts of money, approximately 20% of funding and more in some cases, during the course of the recession.  Funding has not yet been restored to pre-recession levels and we cannot meet the need we know exists with the funding we get from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs via Tusla and the Department of Justice and Equality via Cosc.  While we recognise that both Departments are doing their best within their budgets to fund us, we have huge concerns, given the challenge to meet our current need, that we are certainly not meeting the full need that is out there.  There is a requirement to better assess and understand the need, which is why we keep going back to the call for more adequate and improved data on sexual, domestic and gender-based violence in Ireland.  That is a constant struggle.  While we appreciate what we get, fund-raising must supplement it.  We receive contributions from clients where they can pay, but the majority of clients, if they pay anything, pay less than &euro;20.  It is really a token contribution.<\/p> <p>  Consent in respectful relationships is part of the key to the solution.  So much damage is done where children and young people, in particular, do not understand consent, fail to talk about it, fail to learn when to say \"No\" or \"Yes\" and fail to learn how to hear \"No\" or \"Yes\" either.  It would make a huge difference to the development of respectful relationships and improved self-regard if there was a sufficient focus on that at a time when children are at a vulnerable age.  We have programmes whereby we work with teachers and Youthreach facilitators but it is voluntary.  Teachers and Youthreach workers have to find the money to come to us, although we get some funding for that from Cosc.  In addition, a programme is being rolled out by us and other rape crisis centres and the Manuela Riedo Foundation in Galway is also trying to develop something but these programmes are tiny and they are not going to get us where we need to go.  We also work with universities but while good work is being done there also, it is a patchwork.  While all of that is necessary, there is also a big job for the public.  We have people contacting us, including women of mature age, who say \"I thought I had to put up with it\".  They are only starting to learn now about what consent means in their own relationships.  They were putting up with abusive and violent relationships.  As such, there is a great deal of work for us to do in that area.

I am very grateful to her for affording me this opportunity and I will be brief.<\/p><blockquote>I note that Dr. Peter Boylan sent in an email today just before the Committee met, relating to last week&rsquo;s proceedings.  I also note that you read his email into the record at today&rsquo;s first session of the Committee. [I have no problem with that] I believe that Dr. Boylan has misrepresented me and that nothing that I said was at variance with the facts ... Dr. Boylan claims that I &quot;made several assertions at odds with the facts&quot; at the Committee hearing at which he appeared last Wednesday.  He only attempts to provide one such assertion and even there he doesn&rsquo;t manage to bring his claim home.<br \/><br \/>I said at the Committee that the doctors involved in the Savita Halappanavar case &quot;did not claim that it was down to the law in Ireland but that it was down to the mismanagement of a situation&quot;.  My point has been, and remains, that the doctors involved in that tragic case did not try to blame the law in Ireland for what happened to Savita, but rather that they acknowledged the medical mismanagement of her sepsis.  I have been critical, and remain so, of campaigners who try to exploit Savita&rsquo;s death to bring about the legalisation of abortion, when it has always been the case that any life-saving treatment a mother needs, including treatment that brings her pregnancy to an end, is legal and is routine practice.<br \/><br \/>In support of his claim, Dr. Boylan draws attention to a transcript of the inquest and in particular to a section in which the consultant in the case was asked if she felt &quot;constrained or inhibited by Irish law&quot; and her answer of &quot;Yes.  Because termination of a pregnancy which is what she was requesting, is not legal in the context in which she requested it&quot;. The doctor had just stated that she understood the late Savita was &quot;not physically unwell&quot; and because &quot;the law states that in the absence of risk to the life of the mother there is no reason to intervene&quot;.  At a later point in the transcript, the doctor says that, had she been aware of certain physical symptoms which had been noted earlier, she would have intervened.  So it is clear that the doctors never sought to blame Savita&rsquo;s death on their being unable to give necessary treatment because of the law in Ireland.  My presentation of the facts at the Committee was therefore completely accurate.  Dr. Boylan shouldn&rsquo;t misrepresent my words.<br \/><br \/>It is noteworthy in passing that several obstetricians and a consultant in emergency medicine have taken issue in public with Dr. Boylan&rsquo;s opinion that Irish law prevented necessary treatment to save Savita Halappanavar&rsquo;s life - see Irish Times Letters, 1st May 2013.  They suggest that Dr Boylan&rsquo;s view on this matter is &quot;a personal view, not an expert one&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>That concludes that portion of the statement I issued today relating to Dr. Boylan's comments.  I am very grateful to the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to put this on the record promptly.

We shall present a fairly high-level view of the matters but have provided more detail in our written submission.<\/p> <p>  Most of us received our first indication that there was any problem with our baby's development at the anomaly scan.  This typically takes place between 19 and 22 weeks of gestation.  Others, who may have a history of foetal anomaly or are at increased risk, may receive earlier scans and some people pay for additional testing themselves.  It is important to note that a lot of women do not have access to these tests at all.<\/p><p>Only about half of pregnant women in Ireland are offered anomaly scans.  We heard this week that access to scans in Galway is due to be scaled back later this year or early next year.  I am sure the committee does not need us to tell it how much of a shock it is to be really excited about a pregnancy in one moment only to have a doctor say there may be a serious problem in the next.  In some cases, further tests may need to be performed to get a confirmed diagnosis.  There may also be a need to refer to other specialties like cardiologists, paediatricians and neurologists.  It can take several weeks to schedule all of these tests and to get results, and in some cases we may need to have them repeated over a period to see whether the prognosis for the baby is improving or deteriorating.  Eventually, our doctors will sit down with us and explain in good faith and based on their personal experience what they believe is the most likely outcome for our pregnancy, that our babies are going to die or they will have a very seriously compromised quality of life.  This prognosis will be based upon the results of our tests, what they have learned through their professional experience and the specific manner in which these anomalies have affected our babies.<\/p><p> It is devastating news to hear.  Our hearts are broken and our worlds stop but it is so important that our doctors are frank and honest when they deliver the prognosis to us.  It is important they do not sugar-coat the news with euphemisms because we must have a clear understanding of what our baby faces, and what we face, so we can accept and understand the reality and make an informed decision on how best to proceed.<\/p><p> The decision to either continue or terminate a pregnancy in these circumstances is very difficult for most people.  To make it we need the best information available to us and we need to be able to discuss all options with our medical teams; most importantly, we need personal time and space to arrive at the decision we believe to be best for our baby, for us and our families. <\/p><p> It is important to point out at this stage that it is simply not possible for families to get that level of information, process it and arrive at a decision best for them within a 22-week gestation limit.  We should bear in mind that those who get news at all may only receive an indication that something is wrong around that time.  We propose the 22-week limit recommended by the Citizens' Assembly be set aside in the committee's consideration and there should be no time limit with regard to foetal or maternal health.  We all want to hold on to hope for as long as we can and nobody should be rushed or judged for coming to the point where hope ends.<\/p><p> For those of us who chose to terminate our pregnancies and were forced to travel to lose our babies, we were basically left to our own devices.  As our doctors could not do this for us, we had to find and contact overseas hospitals.  We had to make our own appointments, get copies of our medical records and find fax machines, which is becoming increasingly difficult.  We had to make our own travel arrangements and decide if we would go by aeroplane or by car or boat.  How do we get from the airport or ferry port to the hospital?  Who will travel with us?  If we already have children at home, who will look after them? How do we get time off work?  Do we have a passport and can we even afford it?  It is also worth pointing out that when we go for an induced labour and delivery we have no way of knowing how long it will take and we cannot book a return journey.  We have to wait until the process is over and then make separate arrangements.  This adds to the stress and cost for the families involved.<\/p><p> It is worth reflecting in this context on the words of Mr. Justice Horner when he said that forcing women to travel in these circumstances \"can have the consequence of imposing an intolerable financial and mental burden on those least able to bear it\".  He went on to say \"the protection of morals should not contemplate a restriction that bites on the impoverished but not the wealthy. That smacks of one law for the rich and one law for the poor\".  Nobody in Ireland would support such inequality today.  At a time when we are experiencing the most intense grief of our lives, we find ourselves in another country, often having left Ireland in secret, feeling like medical refugees.  We are abandoned by Ireland - the State and its people - isolated from our families and friends and separated from the medical team that looked after us up to this point.<\/p><p> After the procedure, when we return, we need to figure out if we can bring our babies with us and, if so, how?  If we have our car we can bring our baby home on the boat.  This journey involves us having to go to a supermarket to buy freezer packs.  These are like the types that one uses on sport injuries.  We have to stop at regular intervals on the homeward journey, at petrol stations or supermarket car parks, to open the coffin and change the freezer packs so our baby's remains can be kept cold.  This is so we can present our babies to siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles when we return home at a funeral.  When we cross the Irish Sea, we must leave our baby in the coffin in the car, either on the back seat covered with a blanket or in the boot.  If we are coming home by ferry and do not have a car, we must use public transport; we would have to carry coffins on buses or trains from Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London to Holyhead before boarding the Stena ferry.  That is just inhuman.<\/p><p> If we are flying home, we may be able to bring our baby&rsquo;s remains home but we must check in advance with the airlines and deal with the special assistance staff.  We may need to place the coffin in a holdall or suitcase and check it in as luggage.  This leaves us in a position where we must trust baggage handlers to treat our dead babies with the respect they deserve.  Many people are afraid that simply will not happen.  We could have to collect our baby's remains from a luggage carousel in Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Galway or Knock.  Alternatively, we could take the small coffin on the plane as hand luggage.  These are the circumstances that women and families have to go through literally within hours of giving birth.  Women from this country have had to go through the normal trauma of delivery and the utter grief of losing a much-wanted baby before taking on this type of journey.  How do members think it makes people in this country feel?  Would they be comfortable with their family members or neighbours having to make a journey like that?<\/p><p> Sometimes we cannot bring our baby home as there may need to be an autopsy or results of genetic testing that will provide information about considering future pregnancies.  As we are not in Ireland and we are not National Health Service patients, we have to pay up to &pound;900 for an autopsy.  We then have to arrange cremation, which we may not be able to attend because it involves another trip to the UK or further afield.  We still have to bring our baby's ashes home to the family.  Specialist courier services are now costing between &pound;800 and &pound;900 for delivery of cremated remains so most people travel back to the UK to collect them.  This creates much additional trauma, as apart from cost, one must get back through airport security with a box containing the baby's cremated remains.  Very often, that involves dads having to send mums through ahead as these people know a box with powder will show up on the security scanner and they must explain the origin of the box and why they are travelling home.<\/p><p> Even if we get our babies home, there are more logistics.  How do we arrange a funeral when one is not coming from a hospital in Ireland?  Can we get a priest to officiate?  Some people are afraid to tell priests the truth as they are afraid of being judged and condemned.  Others simply do not want to lie so they forgo the religious ceremony.  Not being able to bring our baby home and not being able to have a normal funeral service, with the support of our family, friends and community, further compounds the sense of isolation and abandonment we feel.  This is a process that is important not just for the parents to get closure, but for the grandparents, siblings and other family members too.  It makes it almost impossible for us to grieve normally and leads to more traumatic, complicated and disenfranchised grief than would be expected if we were properly supported throughout this entire process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#LL01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Edwards","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>It is often assumed the decision to terminate is black and white; a person will do it or not, depending on what she wants.  There are those of us who wish to avail of a termination of pregnancy but do not travel.<\/p><p>Many families and women in Ireland continue a pregnancy, not because it is the right thing for them to do but because the ordeal involved in ending a pregnancy under the current regime is too arduous.  We may not be able to afford to do so.  As Mr. Edwards stated, there are the costs of flights, which may involve up to three round trips, accommodation, the procedure, a post-mortem, cremation and transport home of the baby's remains.  These may amount to as much as &euro;4,000 for each couple, which is a substantial sum of money for most families.  It is certainly a massive sum for my family.  In most cases, these costs are prohibitive.<\/p><p> We may not be able to travel.  We may simply not be able to face the stress of travelling and returning home without a bump or a baby.  The emotional toll of travelling cannot be underestimated.  Grief has many more facets than sadness.  Anxiety, exhaustion, panic attacks and deep mistrust are all symptoms of complicated grief, which can make travelling through airports to foreign cities and in taxis and buses to a strange hospital impossible and much more traumatic than it may appear to an outsider.  This was the greatest barrier for me, alongside the unbearable thought of leaving my two children in Ireland and then leaving their dead sister in England.<\/p><p> The stigma associated with travel is enormous.  Many fear there will gossip and judgment and their family, friends or community will exclude or talk about them.  This, along with the grief, is more than we can cope with.  These are just some of the limitless number of reasons that travelling to end a pregnancy is not an option for everyone, even when we know a termination is the right thing for us, our baby and our family. <\/p><p> What happens to us in circumstance where we will not have a baby is that we are unable to travel and become trapped.  We are in a nightmare scenario where we appear to be expecting a baby but are preparing for a massive loss.  We are asked questions about our growing bump and people expect us to be happy about it.  This is more than a woman can cope with.  To avoid this, we isolate ourselves and hide.  We go inside, lock the door and do not go out again.  We suffer anxiety and nightmares and experience the ever-present knowledge that we are losing a baby alone.  While we wait, we cannot lead normal lives and go to work, we struggle to take care of other children and all our relationships suffer massively.  According to the eighth amendment, none of this matters because being alive is enough.  It is not enough and it was not enough for me. <\/p><p> Pregnancy can affect our physical and mental health, even in previously healthy pregnancies where there are no foetal complications.  However, when something goes wrong, whether it is a miscarriage, the woman's waters break or a foetal anomaly is detected, the risks to one's physical and mental health increase.  Why is it that only our lives matter while we are pregnant?  Why is it okay to completely ignore our physical and mental well-being?  Does our well-being not matter when we are pregnant?  Is it simply set aside and is it okay to be just alive?  Whatever else we do with our laws, we need to ensure the normal duty of care to us, as living, breathing, functional members of society and as women and individuals, is never set aside.<\/p><p> When considering proposed changes to our laws, it is important that the committee also consider how women in Ireland will be protected and assured of access to information and services and have their safety and privacy protected.  If abortion is legalised, it should be incorporated into current maternity care.  Do not leave us out or continue to stigmatise and isolate us.  It is important that lawful services are available to all pregnant women in Ireland, irrespective of where they live, how much they earn or how much money they have.  This means that every maternity hospital, irrespective of its ethos, must be in a position to provide these services at all times.  Health care should never be a black market product and no woman should ever be afraid to seek medical assistance for fear of arrest.<\/p><p> We respect and fully understand that some medical practitioners may object to carrying out abortions of any type on the basis of their own sincere beliefs.  That is grand but we do not accept that this should ever be allowed to prevent a person from accessing the medical care he or she needs.  The responsibility must be on every medical facility, regardless of ownership or ethos, to ensure the facility can and will provide procedures that are legal in this country.  Conscientious objection should not be used in a manipulative manner to avoid taking care of some patients.<\/p><p> We also need to ensure protests, harassment of patients and the barring of access to medical facilities are not tolerated.  We have seen what has been done in other countries and it cannot be tolerated here under any circumstances.  Legally enforceable safe zones around medical facilities should be part of any legislation.  These will be crucial to provide privacy and safety for patients, staff and visitors.<\/p><p> We hope we have been able to open a window into the unnecessary suffering the eighth amendment has inflicted on us and continues to inflict on other women at a time when they are at their most vulnerable and the diagnosis they receive should be the worst thing that has ever happened to them.  We have provided much more detail in our main submission and we recommend that members take time to read the personal stories made available to the committee.  None of us should have to reveal these intimate details to achieve change and we are grateful to those who have trusted us to submit their stories to the committee.<\/p><p> We hope we have been able to shine a light on how unworkable a gestational limit would be when addressing issues of foetal or maternal health.  We are sure that by listening to our lived experiences and reading about how Ireland and its current laws added to our trauma, members will be in a much better informed position to consider the mature and compassionate recommendations made to them by citizens.  We can only speak to the committee of our personal experiences.  We know, however, that all women make decisions in these matters based on their private, personal and valid needs.  We support all choices for everyone.<\/p><p> The committee has an opportunity to make a recommendation to the Government which recognises that we all make decisions around pregnancy and parenting in a mature and responsible manner.  We trust that, having heard the expert evidence and lived experiences presented to it, the committee's recommendations will support us all in our decisions and look after us all when we need it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Cullen-Delsol","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Edwards and Ms Cullen-Delsol for sharing their very sad, personal and intimate stories with us.

Ms Siobh&aacute;n Whelan was one of the women who received support from Ms Mellet, Ms Ruth Bowie and Ms Arlette Lyons quite early on in the group's history.  Ms Mellet provided support to many women while she was still recovering from her own traumatic loss.  Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan made the decision to take the complaints against Ireland because Ireland did not seem to be stepping up to its own responsibilities.  It was really to show everybody the extent to which women are being brutalised and abused by the eighth amendment and by the lack of response from successive Governments to this issue.  I am glad that we have moved on from that point and that we are here today to discuss a solution.<br\/><br\/>Questions were asked about tests.  It is mainly the large Dublin hospitals that offer anomaly scans, the so-called &quot;big scan&quot; between 19 and 22 weeks.  Some people get a dating scan earlier on just so as to make sure that sizes and dates are all right and we know, roughly, the rate at which babies are expected to continue to grow.  These early scans sometimes pick up anomalies, particularly structural anomalies that are easier to spot, but sometimes what doctors refer to as &quot;soft markers&quot; do not show up until the 22-week scan.  Soft markers do not give a clear diagnosis but indicate that there may be developmental issues.  Further tests are then involved.  Some tests require the taking of samples - chorionic villus sampling, CVS, tests frequently go to Scotland, for example - which means that the parents could be waiting for a further week or so to get a schedule for the test and then to get the results back.  They could also be left waiting to get genetic information from an amniocentesis.  There might also be a need for an MRI scan.  Advanced scans might be required for heart issues, for example, which means that further specialists have to get involved to look at the extent to which the heart is developing incorrectly and whether this might be corrected by surgery <i>in utero <\/i>or shortly after birth.  With some conditions, particularly where there is potential for severe impact on the baby that may not necessarily be fatal, parents need a lot more certainty before they can make a decision.  It can take up to two weeks to get an MRI scan.  A mother could quite easily be heading into 26, 28 or 30 weeks by this point and this is assuming that she is receiving proper care. In other parts of the country outside of Dublin, however, services can be particularly poor.  This is no reflection on the doctors or medical staff involved but rather on the lack of resources.  A mother might, for example, go to her GP at 30 or 32 weeks and comment that she has been feeling a reduction in the level of movement.  It might be a mother's instinct that something is wrong late on in the pregnancy that eventually gets her referred for further tests. <br\/><br\/>In the context of the 22-week limit then, there was almost no discussion of severe foetal anomalies at the Citizens' Assembly.  The sets of gestational limits put forward to the assembly did not apply to one particular option over another; they were put forward for all of the votes taken by the citizens.  There was a lack of information there and they were not terribly well informed with regard to the process of diagnosis and getting a prognosis.  Even at that, anyone who is told one's baby has a fatal or very severe condition needs time to think about it.  It would be very damaging to put an arbitrary gestational limit in front of parents to the effect that unless they make their minds up before a certain point, they will be unable to avail of services in Ireland.  There would be a risk that parents might make decisions more hastily than they otherwise would, possibly resulting in people opting for a termination where they might have realised that this was not perhaps the right decision for them if they had only had more time.  Once that decision is made, however, it is made.  I consider a 22-week limit, then, to be completely inappropriate and I hope that fatal and severe foetal anomalies would be considered together in this context and recognised as the tragedies that they are.  These are wanted pregnancies.  Parents who get to the 20-week or 22-week scan intend to bring that baby into their family and anything that intervenes in that is unforeseen.  We need to make allowance for that in our legal and health systems in Ireland, rather than trying to find ways of catching people out or of leaving people outside of the safety nets.  <br\/><br\/>I should also point out that some people have negative views about scans and testing almost as though they were a means to screen out and to eliminate.  I have 11-year old twin daughters at home who are alive only because of the anomaly scan.  They had severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome diagnosed at 20 weeks and it was expected that they would both be dead within a matter of days.  We were able to travel in order to have life-saving surgery for them which is now available here - we had to travel at the time because of resources rather than because of the law.  My daughters are here because we were able to have scans.<br\/><br\/>While I acknowledge it is the intention of the national maternity strategy to provide these services to women throughout the country, it is not happening quickly enough  People may be losing babies as a result of not being able to find out about conditions that could require intervention or necessitate mothers to give birth with the suitably skilled doctors in attendance.<br\/><br\/>I hope I have answered the questions fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Edwards"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for sharing their experiences.

Those were the longest five weeks of my life.  She was born in the maternity wing of University Hospital Waterford and then I got to bring her home for a night and to have a funeral service.  Her family, that is, my parents and my brother got to meet her and my kids got to meet their sister.  It probably sounds like it would not have made a difference had I travelled but I refer to those five weeks  We were standing in the kitchen the day we got the phone call with the diagnosis.  We had decided that we were going to paint the kitchen for the new baby so myself and my husband were standing in the kitchen painting when the phone rang.  We answered and the fabulous midwife from Holles Street hospital told us the she was very sorry but that she had bad news and that our baby was going to die.  I cannot describe that moment.  The world just fell apart and it has never come back together properly since then, though I am getting there.<\/p> <p>  I realised at that point that I was going to have to continue the pregnancy.  I could not face the thought of leaving my kids and I did not have the money to travel; I would have had to borrow it.  I just could not do it.  My little fellow was only 18 months old at the time and he had never spent a night away from me.  As the pregnancy progressed, however, I could feel her getting weaker.  I could feel the movements changing from kicks to movements to flutters that grew further and further apart.<\/p><p>I was timing them and how long it had been since I felt a movement - six hours, ten hours, 14 hours.  For two nights I sat up in bed convinced that she had died and I went through all the emotions.  My child had died.  In my head, she was gone.  I had the grief, the mourning and all those feelings, and then I felt a tiny flutter ten hours later and again 14 hours later.  In essence, I mourned her death twice before I actually experienced it.<\/p><p> In that time, I could not go out.  I could not face the school run, for example, with the other mams at the gates saying, \"When are you due?  You will have a busy Christmas this year.  Are you mad?  They are so close together\", and all the other excited questions.  If somebody said that to me, I would just stand and bawl in front of them.  The children would get distressed and I just did not know what to do.  I was trying to get out and go to the supermarket.  A woman would walk past with her baby and I would literally abandon the trolley and just leave, walk out the door.  I could not face it.  I could not participate in any part of my normal life.  I called in sick to work and I never went back to that job again.  I could not even drive up the road there because the other two women on my team who were pregnant were due around the same time as me.  I still have never seen them in person again.<\/p><p> This was looming ahead of me - I knew I was going to have a stillbirth.  I knew she was dying.  I was 24 weeks pregnant and she still was not kicking.  I knew there was no way she was going to survive very long.  I knew she was going to die.  I was going to have to give birth to a dead baby.  It was ahead of me; I did not know when, but it was going to happen.  The worst thing in my life was in my future but there was no way for me to prepare for it or plan for it and I had no idea when it was going to happen.  The nightmares I had were horrendous.  Every single night I dreamed about what that birth was going to be like.  The fear, the pain, what was going to get me through labour knowing that I would not have a baby at the end of it?  What gets us through labour?  The thought that it will all be worth it in the end.  That is it.  That is what the midwives say to us.  Nobody was going to be able to say that to me.  There was going to be no cry.  I was not going to have a baby to bring home.  I was not going to be able to feed her.  She was never going to have baths.  I was never going to change her nappy.  That was all ahead of me and I could not bear the thought that it was going to happen and I was not able to do anything about it.  I was not going to be able to be her mam.<\/p><p> During that time it just felt like I did not matter.  It felt like I did not count.  All the things that I hold dear, all the things that are important to me in my life, like minding my kids and being a good mam, having a good relationship with my husband, being a good friend, a good daughter, being an all right sister - those things are important to me.  My job was important to me.  When I could not perform any of those functions, it did not matter.  There was a thing that could have been done to help me.  There was something.  I was not asking for a procedure to be invented.  I was asking for something that takes place all around the world, that people recognise as real medical care.  I was denied it.  I was told I did not deserve it, that I was not good enough for it.  The fact that I had to drop out of society, that I could not function, that I was not able to be me any more did not matter just as long as I was alive.  From that experience, I ended up with post-traumatic stress disorder.  I have been on medication ever since.  I take a tablet every day to stop myself going off the deep end.  Had I been given control  and had somebody said, \"actually, it does matter that you feel like this.  It matters enough for us to do something about it\", it would have made all the difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#OO00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Cullen-Delsol","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cullen-Delsol for sharing that with us.

It is terrifying for a woman to be told to hang on in there until she gets sick enough for them to intervene.  We know now that she might get sick enough for intervention but might become too sick to be saved.  The only reason we have not had another Savita in five years is that, because of Savita, people know about the risks and they travel.

For me, the focus of this committee is on the dignity of women.  We are also focusing on unborn life or the unborn children.  Do both witnesses think that the eighth amendment afforded them and their unborn children, now their children who have passed, any dignity?<\/p> <p>  There is a thing when someone is expecting a child - maybe I am wrong on this - that once it gets to 12 weeks, there is a feeling that it is all grand.  Obviously we all know now that is not the case.  However, we think that what happened to the witnesses will not happen to ourselves, that those things happen to other people.  I do not think there is any greater pain, although I know it is hard to quantify pain.  We heard earlier from a psychiatrist about the hormones in the brain affecting the body and all that, which explained a lot to me, but it is a complicated grief, as has been said.  There really is a sense of abandonment and almost a guilt - as though somehow the woman is nearly to blame for the situation because she is the carrier of the child.<\/p> <p>  As the man in the situation, I would like to ask how Mr. Edwards felt.  My own story is documented.  My husband was probably more affected than I was at the time.  How did Mr. Edwards feel in that moment when decisions had to be made?  How did he feel about a vulnerable pregnant woman who, I suppose, he would have liked to take care of and mind?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#PP00500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first and then come back to the issue of dignity.  I felt useless when we got the diagnosis.  We went in for the scan together and we were looking at cr&egrave;ches near work.  I was thinking that if we went for this particular cr&egrave;che, I would be able to pop up during my lunch breaks.  I would be \"Super Dad\" and it would all be wonderful.  For both of us, everything stopped.  My wife, Gaye, was the one who was pregnant.  She was the one who could feel Joshua moving inside her.  She was the one going through all that physical thing.  As dads, we are sort of bystanders.  I think I felt I did not have a function.  There was not a job that I could do to fix anything.  I could not make anything better.  I got to make all the phone calls.  I got to do things like pick out the Golden Pages and try to find phone numbers in London and explain to strangers what was happening.<\/p><p> Since we were at 20 weeks, we could go to a hospital - we did not know any hospitals in England.  I was trying to support Gaye as best I could.  I could not, and did not, deal with any grief at the time because I had things to do.  I had to be the person who did practical things - make appointments, drive, all of that stuff.  At the end, I had to take Gaye away from her baby, our baby.  He was delivered in Belfast and we did not know that one could bring a baby home.  I thought I would have to smuggle my dead son back to try to have a funeral.  I had visions of climbing over a cemetery wall with a shovel.  I knew that I could not do that so we had to leave him behind for cremation and I had to take Gaye away from him.  I did not feel like a good husband or father at that time.  That stuck with me for a long time afterwards.<\/p><p> On dignity, me, my wife and our son were treated with the utmost dignity abroad; we felt we were treated like outcasts here.  We did not get to attend our son's cremation.  We did not know when it was; we just got a courier package at our door within a couple of weeks of his death.  We signed for him like one would any Amazon delivery.  The thought that our son was cremated alone troubled us for a long time.  It really haunted us that we were not there.  Years later, I learned that the pathologist from the hospital travels to the crematorium with the babies that are left in her care.  She takes them in her car and she sits with them while they are cremated so they are not alone.  I learned that about ten years after he died and we cried again then because we saw that there were people who did not know us from a bar of soap and cared about us and our baby enough to do that in a completely unsung way.  It just made us more angry at how we had felt abandoned by Ireland at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#PP00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Edwards","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Every couple's experience is unique.

It depends on the children one might have at home, for example, and one's other responsibilities.  One might be looking after elderly parents, or one might have no money.  We cannot go through all the variables.  No one law will cover every permutation of people's lives because life is messy.  Life is hard at times and there is no quota on tragedy or the amount that life can throw at one and what one has to deal with. <\/p> <p>  What I would like is to never again have to answer the phone to a woman who has questions such as how long her baby will stay warm for or if can get finger prints.

I did not see the earlier session, but the committee will have heard how prenatal mental health care does not exist here.  There are no services.  One does not get looked after, particularly for pregnancies after one has had a loss.  It could be a healthy pregnancy but it could be the hardest, and there is nothing there to support women through those journeys.  I want to see a respectful, dignified procedure where women are listened to, their needs - whatever they may be - are met, where the external family, including the partner, is looked after, the children can talk about what is happening and where a woman can come to a decision that actually meets her needs.

Most of our counselling came from charities or support groups such as our own, Termination for Medical Reasons Ireland.  My daughter has never had counselling although we have requested it several times.  My husband only had counselling this year through work.  Much of it is just maternal mental health care, because there is nothing that can be done physically, especially while one is still pregnant, but one could be supported, listened to and have the opportunity to talk about the situation.  At the moment there is nothing there.  Even in terms of practical support, there is nobody to explain how to fill up a still birth certificate or at what stage.  One has to Google it.  If it was not for my GP, I would have had no one to talk to outside my family.  She used to call me and tell me to come up for an appointment and made sure that I came up every week to talk to her.  I would sit there and rant and cry and she would listen.  That was it and because maternal antenatal care with the GP is free, I could do that for free.<\/p> <p>  My midwife in the hospital only saw me once.  She took me through what a still birth would be like, how I would know when Alex had died, what the signs were and what to do afterwards.  That was in a maternity setting, in a maternity hospital.  When I went in after my doctor could not find a heartbeat, I went to the clinic to have a scan and sat in a room with 30 other pregnant women who were all expecting babies, and I knew my baby was dead.  My son was asleep beside me in his push chair and my husband was beside me, with people coming in and out, asking all the normal questions.  That was just unbearable.  There was no need for that.  We need to be able to afford people privacy and dignity and respect and be understanding of their circumstances.  Imagine sitting there, knowing one's child has died and facing a still birth, having to sit in a waiting room with 30 pregnant women and their excited families.

It is essential for the well-being of all of society because the mams are making the people for the country.

It would be difficult for anybody to listen to what they had to say.  Nobody, including myself, would have even considered some of the details and how harrowing it must have been, particularly for somebody who wants to go through with the abortion but cannot for practical reasons.  That is not widely known in Ireland.  Awareness about fatal foetal abnormality and foetal abnormality, which is as serious, has increased over the past number of years with people such as them speaking out in the national media.<\/p> <p>  How did they feel when two Bills were voted down that might have allowed for fatal foetal abnormality to be dealt with even within the confines of the eighth amendment?  We have been told that it is necessary to repeal or at least amend the amendment to provide for this vital health issue.  The presentation refers to the time limit proposed by the Citizens' Assembly.  We are here to deal with the assembly's report.  It was hugely sympathetic to the view that there must be change on this issue and it overwhelmingly voted in favour.  Would it be fair to say the assembly did not have sufficient time to hear evidence about the difficulties of imposing a 22-week limit?  Termination for Medical Reasons Ireland did not get an opportunity to testify, which is one of the reasons we were anxious to bring the group before the committee.  Should there not be any time limit?  Should it be indefinite?  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  Last week, I asked Peter Boylan a question about late term or post-23 week abortions that we hear a great deal about from people who are opposed to abortion in general.  It tends to be the image that is presented, which must be upsetting for those who have had to go through that.  He made the point that they probably accounted for 1% of abortions.  The issue of a time limit, therefore, would arise rarely.<\/p> <p>  I would like them to comment on another issue but it is entirely up to them.  Reference has been made during previous meetings to Canada and this notion of botched abortions and babies being left to die, which must have been upsetting for people to hear.  The organisation feels strongly about this and I wonder whether the witnesses would care to comment.  I gather from people who have experienced this that sometimes they have been abused on social media by people who oppose abortion.

We believed that there was a legal avenue available.  The advice the Government received was based on the predication that life meant born alive rather than capable of sustaining life and I still believe that had that question been put to the Supreme Court, it would have viewed it sympathetically.  However, that did not get anywhere and we are where we are today.  Hopefully, we can move this on.  It is unfortunate that many people will have suffered in the intervening period without that having been explored to its fullest when the opportunity presented.<\/p> <p>  Gestational limits just cannot be applied when it comes to both foetal and maternal health.  They are completely unworkable and totally arbitrary.  The Citizens' Assembly did not get to discuss severe foetal anomalies.  They recognised that there could not be a time limit for fatal foetal anomaly, but there was no discussion about severe anomalies.  When they were presented with the various options - not at all, up to 12 weeks, 22 weeks or without gestational limit - in respect of each of the votes they cast, questions were asked about where they came from.  They came from the advisory group working with Ms Justice Laffoy; they did not come from the citizens themselves.  They were, therefore, tied into voting along those lines.  Our view is that there cannot be gestational limits.  That will perpetuate the situation of driving people who can travel, from a health point of view, a financial point of view and a legal status point of view, out of the country.  That would create a situation whereby we would be by design making women in Ireland dependent on another country for health care.  If that is done, then we are not an independent country.  If we are going to describe ourselves as an independent country, then we need to look after all the people in Ireland here.  That is what independence is about; it is not just about the bits one likes.<\/p> <p>  The comments on late term abortions have been made for some time and not just during the current committee debates.  Comments about botched abortions, whether they are in Canada, Australia and England, and babies being born alive and left to die alone by parents and doctors in corners of hospital rooms, as though they have to move equipment out of the corner to put the baby in to die, are absolutely outrageous.  I cannot understand the humanity behind coming up with that type of a grotesque scenario.  We were aware that late term abortions generally happen because of foetal or maternal health.  If the mother's health is in danger, the doctors will do everything they can to save the baby without compromising the mother, otherwise we are talking about situations where it is because of foetal health.  There is always the possibility that a baby may be born alive and there is a medical procedure the mother can take, which will stop the baby's heart.  That is to prevent distress to the baby if he or she is alive when delivered.  Some women choose that and people in the anti-abortion campaign criticise those women for making that difficult decision while other women choose not to do this.  That can result in a live birth but that is not a botched abortion.  An expected outcome from a premature induced labour is that the baby may die and women choose that because they may wish to have the opportunity to meet their baby.  It gives them great comfort to do so and those babies, like any other baby, are given all the comfort and care they require to help them to pass away peacefully.  They may do that in their mother's arms.  It is quite repugnant for anybody to try to portray bereaved parents and the doctors who care for them in that particular manner.<\/p><p>We fully understand that people will have different views about abortion services.  That is perfectly natural, but it is important, both here and in the national debate, that we stick to facts and honesty and keep the grotesquery away from this kind of debate.  It is too serious.

I was supposed to get them on a Friday and I had wait the weekend and get them on Monday because the fax machine in the laboratory in Scotland broke.  Rather than, I think the term was \"dragging us up and down to Dublin\", they said they would give us a call.  The fabulous midwife in Holles Street rang and gave us the news.

When I asked what do I do, however, he started saying that some people find work is a nice distraction and I might go back to work.  I was saying I could not go back to work.  I was massive.  I had a huge bump.  Later I found out that was because Alex did not have a mouth or stomach and she was not swallowing the amniotic fluid.  So my bump grew and grew and grew.  I could not face that.<\/p> <p>  Then they said that they were not going to keep dragging me up and down, there was nothing they could do for me there and they would relay me back to my team in Waterford.  I had been with the Domino midwives, who look after the woman, but with a light touch with very little intervention.

Eventually, I got an appointment with the consultant in Waterford and he saw me.  I had a funny turn when I went into that waiting room again, with lots of pregnant women, but, luckily, another amazing midwife came tearing out and dragged me into the corridor stating that she did not want me to have to sit out there and she had been waiting for me all day.

We look at everything that has to be taken into account with severe anomalies, in terms of finances, whether there will be someone to care for the child when the parents become elderly and die, what happens to the child then if he or she has a severe disability, the impact and burden on the child's siblings, and if there is another child in the household with high needs.

It is no easy task to try to cope in these circumstances.  A woman is going to make a decision based on her immediate family and other environmental factors, such as whether she has family support, enough money, how she is coping with her life, if she has underlying physical or mental health conditions, her age, and whether the baby she is expecting is going to have serious quality of life issues that will not, however, necessarily shorten his or her life.  The woman has the question of what happens when she can no longer care for this dependent child as an adult.  Will she have to ask her other children to do that?  Will she have to depend on the State to do that?  That woman will have to look at and ask those questions.  The Constitution is not a factor there.  Women are not saying that the law says that they have to continue with pregnancies and therefore must.  The law, as it stands, just interferes with women accessing the care that they may choose to take that is in the best interests of them, their family and the baby.  It is their parenting decision to make.<\/p><p> If the committee wants to create a situation in which more women will choose to continue with their pregnancies, then it needs to provide a better environment for them to do that.  There need to be better social supports, carers need to be better treated and there need to be better facilities for people with additional needs.  If money and skilled people are no object and there is a utopia, there will still be people who choose to terminate a pregnancy and the Oireachtas will still have a responsibility to support them in that decision.  We certainly should not need to try to bring other families out into the open to explain their personal circumstances for the committee to imagine that scenario.  Anyone who has been pregnant or who has contemplated having a family knows that, going through pregnancy, anything can go wrong.  We are all afraid of getting bad results and I think most of us can understand that people sometimes have to make very difficult decisions and need to be supported in that.  I think it is a wider societal issue, and just saying what the law is and that there is a medical service that we are not prepared to provide benevolently is not a solution for the issue nor is it against it.  The issue is wider than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#SS00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Edwards","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Edwards and Ms Cullen-Delsol for their very emotional testimony.

I think Deputy Coppinger mentioned it too.  Before I spoke to anybody about what I had gone through, I was absolutely terrified and convinced that there was something wrong with me since I wanted to end a pregnancy.  There must have been something wrong since, if I could not do it, how could it be considered right?  I was convinced that there must be a reason we did not provide it.  By the time that I came to the understanding that there was nothing wrong with me and it was a reasonable thing, I was still terrified because I thought everybody else would think there was something wrong with me.  I started to speak to people about it, including family, friends and wider circles.  I then spoke to an amazing journalist who interviewed me and took the story.  It snowballed from there.  The vast majority of the thousands of messages that I have received publicly and privately or from people coming to me on the street have been nothing but supportive, kind and understanding.  I cannot overstate that and the resonance that people have when they hear the story.  They all have their own stories about sisters, friends and mothers.  It has touched every family from what I can see.<\/p> <p>  There have been some voices, mostly on the fringe, who would disagree vehemently with what I believe.  I am pro-choice and they are not, and they have no problem expressing that, sometimes in really vile ways.  They are keyboard warriors for the most part and it is all online.

It was just a video that I put up because I thought that people needed to see what we are faced with.  I lost a baby and none of these images will ever be worse than looking at one's own dead child.  At the same time, it is not on.  It is awful.  There are kids present.  I have my own kids.  It is normally one of those things where people get together, there are many mothers, all chatting, we go for a little walk, we chant a bit, and then we all go for coffee and cake.  I took a video of this horrible counter-protest, having been set up with all these rotten images, and put it online.  Thousands of people saw it and commented.  Maybe five of the 30,000 or so people who watched that video had something very nasty to say.  It is all along the same lines.  Much of it has a religious basis, and when that does not sink in, they target people personally.  They will say that I am a terrible mother and did not love my baby enough, that if I had enough faith in God, I would not have lost my baby, that if I had loved the baby enough, she would still be here, and that I am using my own dead baby to allow for the deaths of other babies.  They call me a murderer and a witch etc.  It is a very small number of people.  The impact of it at the time varies depending on my own emotional well-being.  Sometimes it floors me and sometimes it does not.<\/p> <p>  In general, the response is amazing.  People are fabulous and inherently good.  I know we tend to legislate assuming the worst of people but I do not believe that.  I think people are genuinely good and that if we give people the opportunity to show their true colours, people are generally fantastic.  The support, kindness, care, love and compassion we are capable of is outstanding.  It comes from all sides and sectors of society and from all ages.  It is fantastic and has got me through some of my worst times.  A perfect stranger, someone who used to work with my husband, came up to me when I was queueing for a coffee and said that I was amazing, to keep doing what I was doing and that they were sorry for my loss.<\/p> <p>  I did not encounter resistance in the medical community.  I found it to be incredibly supportive.  When I said that I was considering travelling, many people in it said not to consider it yet but to wait and see what happened.  They said to wait and see what services I would get and how I got on.  I think much of that was more to protect me.  As time went on and my condition was deteriorating mentally and emotionally, many said to me that if they could do something for me, they would and that they were sorry I had go through that and that it was not fair.  That was the general response that I got.<\/p><p>It goes back to people being generally compassionate.  They understand it and they get it.  They see it every day and they know.  I cannot speak highly enough about the people who took care of me when I was pregnant.<\/p><p>  The woman who did my first scan insisted on doing the last one also.  She was there.  That was one of the reasons I was waiting so long in a room with a pregnant woman.  The same woman wanted to be the one to do the scan.  She wanted to look after me, and she did.  She took loads of pictures for me.  She let me be the one to say there is no heartbeat because she knew I needed to take back some of the control at that point.  While I was in labour, which took two days, she came in to see me to make sure that I was getting enough pain medication and make sure I was being looked after.  The antenatal midwife did the same thing.  Both of them popped in and out, with their coats on or with their lunch boxes, when they could.  If they could get the time they would come in to see me.  When my consultant realised that after 36 hours I still had not given birth, and that after three doses of Misoprostol or whatever it was called, I still was not in active labour but that I was just in pain and waiting, he left the conference he was at in Dublin and drove back down to Waterford.  He walked into the room and he said it was Friday afternoon and that if I did not give birth by that evening, I would have to go home for the weekend and come back on Monday.  He asked me what I wanted to do.  I said I could take the pain and to double the dose and he did.  A couple of hours later, Alex was here.  It meant I did not have to go home and wait another weekend carrying a dead baby.  I cannot speak highly enough of them.  Once we give our medical teams the tools and the freedom to take care of people properly, we can trust them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#TT00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Cullen-Delsol","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I suppose all I can say is that this is extraordinarily difficult for both of the witnesses and for others who are in the same situation.  It is also extremely powerful in terms of explaining to people what is involved.  Like others, I thank the witnesses for this.  Most of the questions have been around the experience of the baby dying.  I was particularly moved by the cruelty of what happens after the baby dies, and having to bring the baby home in the case of people who went to England or Northern Ireland, and having to put the baby in the boot of the car crossing the ocean, or on the carousel in the airport, or having the ashes of the baby with a courier.  For any of us who lose somebody we love, having a funeral, whether it is cremation or burial or religious or otherwise, is an important right, and it must be particularly important in terms of in some way coming to terms with, and dealing with, the whole traumatic experience.  Will the witnesses expand a little on this experience and, in particular, on the fear of people actually saying they have had a termination but need a funeral?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#UU00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508934600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I will take this question.  We delivered our son in Belfast, which was just a car journey up the road, and we were afraid to bring him home.  We did not know how to bring a dead baby across the Border and what do we do when we get home.  Nobody could tell us what to do.  Nobody could counsel us on that.  Neither my wife nor I ever got counselling of any description.  As I explained earlier, he was cremated without us being there and we got his ashes from a courier.  We still have them at home.  I did not realise it at the time, but I certainly came to realise over the passing years, that the lack of a funeral had affected me greatly.  It caused me an awful lot of hurt.  I was on antidepressants for ten years and I did not really know why until I went and got better help myself.  One day, we were expecting and we had the dreams and then we had nothing.  We had no place to go.  We had no grave.  All of our friends knew we were expecting a baby and then there was nothing.  There was no closure.  My parents never met their grandson.  My sisters and Gaye's father never met him.  Gaye's mother travelled with us.  She is the only other person who saw him and met him.  If we had been able to deliver him here, all of our families could have got to see him.  It would have made him more real for all of us, and not just this spot of bother we had or something.  He is still our son.  The whole ability to have a funeral, and have that social right, is really important.  This is why more and more people are going to the extremes they are going to try to ensure that they can bring their baby home, because they need that closure.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier about people being anxious about approaching their priests.  Unfortunately, having a severe or fatal foetal abnormality is quite indiscriminate and does not recognise whether someone is religious or not or has money or not, or anything like that.  A number of people we have supported have told us about going to their priests and the nuns in their parishes, and every one of them has said they were treated wonderfully.  It is important to point this out because sometimes this is played out as being something that it is not, in terms of being religious or non-religious.  For those who have religion and for whom having a religious right is important, our experience anecdotally has been the priests and nuns in the parish and community, the ones who will sit at someone's kitchen table having a cup of tea while someone is crying, understand it and they get it.  They approach it from a ministry of love, compassion and healing.  Some of the hierarchy have a bit more of a judgment and condemnation thing going on, and this is unfortunate because it scares people away from approaching their local clergy because they have that fear.  I do not think this helps anybody.  Life is tragic enough.  Sometimes people need psychological help and sometimes they need spiritual help.  Those doors should be open to them.  Having proper closure and not being treated as an outcast is crucial for their well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017102500002#UU00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Edwards"},{"type":"speech","time":1508934600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>We need to acknowledge the importance of the witnesses' words to the committee in highlighting these issues, which, to passers-by and those not directly affected, are not issues at all but which have an impact on those who are directly affected in a way the witnesses have described very adequately.

Good morning, Chairman and committee members.  I am head of the acute hospitals policy unit in the Department of Health, with overall responsibility for the children&rsquo;s hospital project.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Kennan, assistant principal officer in the same unit.  I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to come here this morning to talk about the children&rsquo;s health Bill 2017, concerning Phoenix Children's Health.  The Bill is listed in the Government's legislative programme for publication this session as a priority for the Department.  Accordingly, the agreement by this committee to prioritise scrutiny of the heads is very much appreciated.<br\/><br\/>As members all know, the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to transform paediatric services in Ireland.  It is essential that the children's hospitals come together operationally well in advance of the move to the new facilities in order to ensure their effective functioning as a single entity, and to support the clinical, operational and cultural integration programme.<br\/><br\/>The children&rsquo;s health Bill 2017 provides for the creation of a new entity that will be responsible for the operation of the new children&rsquo;s main hospital and two paediatric outpatient departments, OPDs, and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  The establishment of such an entity through legislation has the support of the three hospitals - Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Children's University Hospital and the paediatric services in Tallaght.  The development of the draft legislation has benefitted enormously from the close engagement of the three hospital boards with the Department through the legal entity committee of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group board.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister advised the committee at it meeting last week, the new hospital will be completed by the middle of 2022.  The paediatric OPD and urgent care centre at Connolly will open in 2019 followed by the second centre at Tallaght in 2020.  The new body will run the services on the existing sites at Tallaght, Temple Street and Crumlin until the time when the services can be provided from the new hospital and from the two OPD urgent care centres currently being developed.<br\/><br\/>It is essential that we have the right structure and approach in place to integrate the existing services over the next few years and to prepare for the delivery of the best possible paediatric health care in the new facilities.<br\/><br\/>On 26 July 2017, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill based on the general scheme we are discussing today.  The legislation will provide for the establishment of a new entity to run the children&rsquo;s hospital, to take on a leadership role nationally in regard to paediatric health care and to play a central role in the national roll-out of a new model of paediatric and neonatology services.  Its functions will allow it to deliver on its remit for education and research, commensurate with its status as the national leading body in children&rsquo;s health care.<br\/><br\/>It is appropriate in drafting the scheme that we are establishing a distinct body with appropriate governance.  The new entity will be managed and overseen by a competency-based board of 12 members, appointed by the Minister for Health.  The board will have sufficient autonomy to make the decisions required in order to effectively manage the operation of the hospital.  This, for example, will extend to managing property, entering into contractual arrangements, accepting gifts and engaging in philanthropy.  <br\/><br\/>In regard to accountability, the legislation provides for a requirement for ministerial approval in consideration of borrowing and a mechanism for intervention in the case of failure on the part of the board.  This safeguard is considered to be essential, given that this is the national tertiary paediatric hospital and the delivery of a safe, quality service must be assured.<br\/><br\/>As the existing hospitals will no longer provide services after the new facilities become operational, the legislation also provides for the transfer of all staff, data, assets, rights and liabilities to the new body such as are appropriate for transfer.  The Bill is included among the priority legislation for publication this session in the Government's legislative programme for autumn 2017.  While we are working on the basis of enactment by the end of the first quarter of 2018, allowing for a reasonable timetable for publication and a smooth passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, it is acknowledged that we are working to a tight timescale.<br\/><br\/>In addition to legislation enactment, there are due diligence and merger processes to be concluded before commencement by ministerial order.  A significant programme of due diligence is under way as part of the overall pre-commencement analysis and review work being undertaken as part of the children&rsquo;s hospital programme.  The outcome of this work will be known and agreed before legislation commencement.  We are anxious to have the body in place as soon as possible to lead the necessary preparations, including advance planning for the OPD and urgent care centres, and we were advised by the group CEO last week that the hospitals will be prepared for commencement by mid-2018.  However, the Department, in conjunction with the HSE, will undertake an options appraisal of the pros and cons of commencement taking place during the financial year 2018 to inform the final decision on commencement timing.<br\/><br\/>This legislation also provides for certain amendments to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board establishment order.  Those include that members of the board shall be appointed from among persons who have the experience and expertise in regard to matters connected with the functions of the board, rather than through the processes of nomination of bodies.  The scheme provides the legal mechanism for the dissolution of that board in due course.<br\/><br\/>Provision is also being made for the option for the Minister for Health to make an order giving the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board responsibility for the planning, design, building, furnishing and equipping of the new maternity hospital that will be located with the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus.  It is considered prudent to allow for this provision in this general scheme, pending a final decision as to whether this function will be given to the development board.<br\/><br\/>Since the Government decision approving the drafting of legislation based on the general scheme, the<b><\/b>Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has been drafting the legislation.  It will conclude its drafting following the receipt of the report of this committee to allow for publication of the Bill by the year's end.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  We will be happy to take any follow up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fionnuala Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duffy.

We are joined by Dr. Jim Browne, who is the chair of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board; Mr. Turlough O&rsquo;Sullivan, vice chair of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin; Mr. Derek McGrath, board member of Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital; and Ms Catherine Guy, board member of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board.<\/p><p>Mr. Liam Dowdall, chair of Tallaght Hospital, unfortunately, had to send his apologies.  The presence of these representatives demonstrates that the commitment of these four boards to the vision for children&rsquo;s health is truly commendable.  It clearly demonstrates the agreement of the four boards to voluntarily transition to a new stand alone children&rsquo;s hospital and to a single legal structure to govern and manage paediatric services in Dublin, as the central hub of a clinical network for paediatric services in Ireland.  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group is working with colleagues in the three children&rsquo;s hospitals, the HSE and the Department of Health to achieve an ambitious transformation programme for acute paediatric services - one that will be equipped to serve the needs of children and young people in Ireland today and for generations to come.<br\/><br\/>Central to this work is the implementation of a new national model of care for paediatric health services in Ireland.  This will have at its centre a new children&rsquo;s hospital in Dublin providing tertiary and quaternary care and two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres<b><\/b>located on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital, currently under construction, will bring the three children&rsquo;s hospitals together under one roof and, before this, into a single legal entity.  The network approach being planned will deliver care seamlessly across a network of services, working closely with our colleagues in the other hospital groups and community health care organisations, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<br\/><br\/>Paediatric services in Dublin are currently provided by three separate voluntary hospitals, namely, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght Hospital.<br\/><br\/>In parallel with the physical building of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and two<b><\/b>paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres, an ambitious integration programme is under way to ensure that all staff and all clinical services are successfully brought together, operating as one ahead of the physical move into the new buildings.  Our integration programme is focused on our people, on valuing and aligning our different cultures, integrating our IT systems and standardising clinical and operational protocols, staff recruitment and training.  It touches all parts of the operations of the hospitals and all parts of service delivery.  It has at its centre the health, safety and well-being of children and young people and valuing our staff.  The programme of integration is been undertaken at a time when we continue to deliver care and services in three very busy acute hospitals.  This programme for change takes years to implement and, therefore, will be enabled greatly by the early enactment of the children&rsquo;s health Bill 2017.<br\/><br\/>The three children&rsquo;s hospitals have long established histories, with between 60 and 196 years of delivery of services to children, young people and their families.  The success of our integration will require a continued commitment to planning and implementation to ensure that the reconfiguration of services is undertaken in the right way, within the right timeframe and in the interests of the patients that we serve.  To support this integration work from a legal and governance perspective, the three children's hospitals and their boards have voluntarily agreed to come together as part of a new single entity.  This new single entity on commencement will take over the governance and management of services currently provided by these three hospitals, and the rights and liabilities of the three hospitals will transfer into it.<br\/><br\/>The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board has a new vastly experienced board.  Included in the papers submitted to the committee is the actual board membership and the members' competencies.  That needs to be put on a statutory footing as soon as possible to enable and facilitate the scale of work that will be required and to allow clear governance of the new services planned to open in 2019 at Connolly Hospital.  It is critically important that Ireland&rsquo;s new paediatric services are being delivered under the right governance structures, built on the vast experience of the existing boards in their governance of services.  It is imperative that the planning of integration work is undertaken by the appropriate legal structure.  This will give impetus to our work, provide protection and assurance to our staff and patients and will act as a catalyst for progress to our continued programme of integration . Importantly, it also provides assurances for staff that their terms and conditions will remain the same as they transfer.  We are satisfied that the model proposed in the general scheme provides the best support for a new legal entity in light of the significant change management process that we are undertaking.<br\/><br\/>As members will know, we announced the new name for children&rsquo;s health services on Monday last, Phoenix Children&rsquo;s Health.  It is a particularly fitting name given what the mythical figure of the phoenix represents opportunity, transformation, and regeneration.  We are entering into an extraordinary period of change in children&rsquo;s health care.  I know that the committee will agree with me that it is long overdue.  The legislation will play a critical role in supporting us in the three hospitals and the Children's Hospital Group in providing the single entity required to support our staff delivering paediatric services as we work to deliver the vision for children&rsquo;s health care.  I thank the committee and I am happy to take any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.

The Deputy is right, it is refreshing to see an all-female panel.  I do not think anyone would see anything wrong with that, because very often we do sit in front of all-male panels.  That is no disrespect to those men, who I am sure all work very hard, but it is a refreshing change.  The witnesses are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The first that comes to mind relates to sprinklers.  I know that was not specifically addressed in the opening statements, but it would be remiss of us to pretend people were not discussing it outside this room, because they were.  I am willing to be corrected on this, but it appeared that there was an argument involving a compromise on health and safety so this would be a good opportunity to make a statement that health and safety will always win out over aesthetics.  We need to be very clear on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hardiman referred to the name of the hospital.  I thought it was a bit premature to name what is effectively a building site at this stage, but I would also be interested to know how that name was arrived at.  My colleague, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, submitted to successive Ministers for Health what I, and others, would deem to be an eminently appropriate name.  That is not for consideration here today, but the witnesses might outline the process.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the terms and conditions of staff, it is of course impossible to transfer people on the same terms and conditions, because one of those terms and conditions specifies where they work and that is clearly going to change.  The witnesses might outline for us what negotiations have taken place.  There is only one other person in the room who would have more experience of negotiating for staff and their terms and conditions of employment than me.  I had some experience of transfers.  I know that it can be incredibly difficult, and that the thing to do is to start as early as possible.  I would question the use of the phrase \"in accordance with their existing pay and conditions\", and I would substitute \"on terms and conditions no less favourable\".  That actually covers what would be captured in a collective agreement, and is a term that would have been used.<\/p> <p>  Also in regard to staff, there is a mix of privatised and directly employed staff in all the hospitals.  I have some knowledge of some of them and zero knowledge of others, but regarding terms and conditions, how is that distinction going to be incorporated?  For example, cleaning services in one hospital may be outsourced while in another cleaning staff are directly employed.  Again, my preference is for directly employed staff, and I would like to see that incorporated into the legislation if possible.<\/p> <p>  There is a reference in head 10 to land, property, gifts and borrowing.  Under that head, could the issue of car parking be addressed?  We understand that there is going to be substantial car parking, and God knows we have had enough discussion about where it is going to be and how it is going to be organised.  The next question is whether the hospital is going to run it or whether it is envisaged as a very lucrative source of income for a private entity.  The committee will know my feelings on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the make-up of the board, there are 12 board members.  It would strike me as sensible to have an uneven number in the case of a dispute.<\/p><p>I would also be interested to know, given the conversation we have just had, if there would be any objection to the legislation mandating a minimum 50% female and 50% male membership, if we could designate it in that way.  I note that the board is not doing too badly with the current ratio of 41% female membership, which is certainly better than the ratio here.  Perhaps we should not be pointing any fingers.  Would the witness have any objection to that?<\/p><p> On head 16, conditions of office of membership of the board, will a briefing be provided to the other members of the board and the Oireachtas where a member is removed?  I refer to where a Minister would exercise his or her power to remove a member of the board.  How is that going to be communicated to the community in general as well as the board members?  Would the witness envisage that a briefing would also be given to us?<\/p><p> With regard to the hospital lands and what is laid out in sections 31, 32, 40, 48 and 55, perhaps this is not a question the witness can answer, but is it envisaged that the lands will remain in use by the health service?<\/p><p> Head 8 refers to the pursuit of fundraising activities.  That issue has had its more than its fair share of controversy so perhaps the witness might outline what exactly is envisaged by that and how that is going to work.  In other entities that worked as a mechanism to enhance wages.  However, that invited much criticism.  Perhaps the witness might outline how that is going to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#F00500","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Reilly.

I have two concerns.  One is the transition period leading into when the hospital is built.  Is there going to be a period of time when staff coming from a number of different locations will transfer to work for a period of time with colleagues from another facility?  Is that planned for so that people can become aware of practices and procedures in one place?  The witness mentioned bringing many different work practices together.  There has to be a lead into that.  I know it is some time away yet but it is something that needs to be looked into.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I have relates to management, which I raised here last week.  I referred to one hospital facility where there were ten managers in 18 years.  We are talking about independence.  In regard to the management structure, what level of independence is it envisaged that the board would have?  We already have difficulties in the recruitment of medical consultants.  However, we also have a difficulty in getting management in and staying in place.  What level of independence will the board have?  Will it be able to agree salary scales above the HSE guidelines?  This going to be a huge project to manage and someone with very good managerial skills will be needed.  I am not saying such people are not already in place.  However, it is fine to get people but the issue then is to hold on to them.  What level of independence will the board have in regard to negotiating pay and conditions in order to get the best person in to do the job?  It is something that needs to be looked at now.  Will the board have to stay within all the HSE guidelines?  Will there be discretion in regard to what agreement the board can arrive at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#G00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":753,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Burke.

Obviously, a smooth transfer of staff is important to this project.  It is one of the reasons we need to embark on this very early on.  We have a multiannual transfer programme to make sure it is smooth.  Negotiations have already started with staff and perhaps Ms Hardiman may elaborate on that.  It is important to us that there is a smooth transfer of staff and that there are plenty of opportunities for staff to integrate and to have a virtual single hospital across the city well in advance of the move to the new facilities.  There are moves afoot to have that rotation and learning from each other and standardisation in practices.  It is a crucial part of integration that brings benefits and opportunities for staff.  Ms Hardiman might also elaborate on the details of discussions under way in that area.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the land, Ms Hardiman might confirm the ownership and the future ownership of the land and what will transfer and what is appropriate there.<\/p> <p>  With reference to gender balance on the board, as a State board there is a process in place to appoint members to the board.

Perhaps Ms Hardiman might discuss what is envisaged in terms of the running of the car park and how that might be an integral part of the hospital overall.<\/p> <p>  We have had many recruitment challenges overall in the health sector.  We are hopeful that these new facilities, both the urgent care centres out in Connolly and Tallaght and the main hospital, will almost be a magnet to attract hospital staff, both clinicians and non-clinicians, because it will be a very exciting place to work.

I would like to add to some of the responses to questions.  The plan for pensions is that staff are transferring so pension rights are protected.  I can give that assurance.  From an employment perspective, we see the vast majority of staff still working in their existing locations until we do the reconfiguration.  That will be planned with staff.<\/p> <p>  Staff engagement is very important and we have two approaches to that.  We totally recognise the well-established mechanisms that are in place for major change management and the importance of engagement and involvement of staff in shaping where they are going to be.  We have set up a formal engagement framework process with all the official trade unions that have negotiating rights.  We have brought it through the national structures.  We have had very good engagements from all the representative bodies where we have agreed the steering group terms of reference and the structure of how we are going to proceed.  We have had our first meeting and a second meeting is happening before the end of the year.  There is a requirement for specific work groups that relate to specific issues to specific members of staff and that is what is envisaged in terms of how we will work.  Our employee relations lead is starting to acknowledge the work that needs to undertaken on this.  That is the formal side and we recognise that getting that started early is very important for the next four to five years ahead.<\/p> <p>  On the other side, and in regard to the Bill we are talking about today, the vast majority of staff will not feel any different in their daily operational work of looking after children and their families in their hospitals.  It is very important that staff feel they have a way of inputting in terms of shaping the future of this service.  A programme kicked off whereby staff members are engaging in the programme called On the Move Together.  Staff can get their voices heard about shaping how it is we are going to shape the service into the future.  We have had roadshows in the three children's hospitals and 700 staff turned up to those roadshows.  Many of the staff have put their names forward to be part of this programme.  The children's hospitals staff are very committed to the delivery of services for children's health, so I am not surprised that many want to be part of shaping our future together.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the name, we had an extensive process that took about nine months.  We did some research into this.  In my previous role of CEO of Tallaght Hospital, I changed the name there.  I certainly did not want Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street University Children's Hospital and the National Children's Hospital at Rialto.  The primary concern of members of the public is that they get the care and the treatment wherever they go.  Everybody understands that.  <\/p> <p>  The name of the organisation is really important to staff.  We undertook roadshows around the three children's hospitals and we invited staff to put forward suggestions for a name.  We also went to the regional units because they are part of a network.  It is not just a hospital that we are naming.  We had about 1,000 submissions and 300 names came out of that process.  We set up a steering group that was representative of the staff and parents, which was very important.  We went through a process of focus groups that involved more members of staff and more parents.  We did market research with the public and, most importantly, the Youth Advisory Council, which the committee has heard me talk about before, and which has an extensive history of using our services.  They helped us to come up with a name which really was to work on several levels.  It is not just a building.  People see that services are not about buildings anymore.  Services are about a network that is broader and can reach even into the home.  It needed to work at its location in Rialto.  If we followed the example of Beaumont, for instance, we would have called the hospital Rialto.  That would not work, however, with Rialto at Connolly and Rialto at Tallaght.  It needed to work in multiple locations.<\/p> <p>  We tried to reflect its mythical character.  Phoenix stands for inspiration, hope, transformation, growth and this constant sense of renewal that we think really reflects the aspiration of our staff in what they try to do everyday with the children and the families we serve.  Another element of it was that it was easy to pronounce.  We had a speech and language therapist on our selection committee and she was very clear that some names are difficult for small children to pronounce.  It had to go through that linguistics test.  It is also easy to translate into Irish.  It is f&eacute;inics and it is pronounced the same way linguistically.  As our vision for the service is an all-island network, it needed to work for all our colleagues on the whole of the island, including our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  It had many tests and it was robustly challenged.<\/p> <p>  Hence, we see the name very much as a unifying name.  Phoenix Children's Health is the name of the network.  Phoenix Children's at Tallaght is the outpatient and urgent care centre, Phoenix Children's at Connolly is the one at Connolly and Phoenix Children's Hospital Ireland is the hospital as part of that network.  That was the process behind it.  I hope that helps the committee understand it.  I know submissions were made and those names were considered as part of this process.  However, for all the reasons I have outlined, some of the names put forward were ruled out, including the names Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh put forward.<\/p> <p>  On the terms and conditions, the majority of staff are going to continue to work where they are at the moment.  We are assuring staff they will have no less favourable pay and conditions.  We are conscious that we have to go through a process over the next four years to get to a single hospital.  There differences in staff salary scales; we understand that.  It is a process of going through that over the next four years.<\/p> <p>  On the mixture of privatised and public staff, as part of the due diligence on what we call the pre-commencement analysis and review, we have taken cognisance of all those contractual arrangements.  The vast majority of them are similar across the hospitals and we do not see it as an issue.  However, we need to look at contemporary ways of working into the future.  As always, we will comply with the guidance around employment negotiations and other agreements that have been put in place.  We are more similar at the moment than we are dissimilar on getting to the new hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":762,"content":"<p>On privatisation, and if we just take cleaning staff as an example, off the top of my head I can give two examples - one where they are directly employed and one where they are not.

What I will say is that we have carefully taken into account how it has worked within the existing hospitals.  We have a mixed model and that has stood to us because the HIQA reports on the three children's hospitals have demonstrated in particular areas that direct employment has worked really well while in other areas outsourcing has benefitted.  We will take the experience of the children's hospitals going forward.  However, we have a mixed model at the moment across the hospitals.  I, more than likely, see that continuing because of the benefits demonstrated.  I am talking specifically about cleaning here.<\/p> <p>  In other areas there are structures that we will go through and that we know are well-established industrial relations processes.  Of course, we will recognise those mechanisms in any of the proposals that we put forward.<\/p><p>On the question on land, to be clear, the heads talk about the transfer of assets.  The only land owned by the three children's hospitals is in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The others are not owned and, therefore, will not be transferring.  The proposal is that Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin will be transferred to the Children's Hospital Group.  We have started formal discussions on that with the HSE to see potential future use but I assure the committee that we will be using it for the next five years so we do not need to have it all concluded.  It is important to note that the objective of that board is for the benefits to be for children's health.  I want to be clear that it is not that we are running services on these hospitals because we need all the services to be consolidated but that is one of the conditions we would like to see honoured in those discussions.<\/p><p> There is very clear guidance in the health system around car parking.  It is not core business to us.  We do not have it in Temple Street, so it is only in Tallaght and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  It is managed by a car parking company.  One of the things we are working through is the funding of that.  I might ask the chief financial officer to talk about that.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the issue of the lands.  To be very clear, the children's hospitals have a good record on fundraising and have very well-established foundations that successfully fundraise for both the existing hospitals and our very important research agenda and patient comforts programme.  We have had a very positive meeting with the three foundations only two weeks ago who came to say that like us, they will merge into one foundation, which is a very positive development.  We welcome that.  We are working closely with them in establishing the future philanthropy and fundraising activity for the new children's hospital.<\/p><p> I totally support what Senator Colm Burke said regarding the transition period that is required for the amount of change we need to do.  As we are opening up the new facilities, the first of which is the Phoenix Children's Hospital in St. James's Hospital in 2019, there is an element of rotating staff within those services because not all services are there so it is predominantly our emergency department, general paediatrics and trauma orthopaedics.  That is a key element of success whereby the people who are delivering services know each other when they go into the facilities and understand their processes.  Part of the reason it is so important to start the integration programme so early is so we standardise as many of those processes as possible so that people are not doing things differently when they come together in the facilities.<\/p><p> I concur with the point made about sustainable management.  In large projects, the moving on of senior staff is seen as a big risk.  We are on an infectious albeit challenging programme.  It is really important that we attract the best people to deliver on this.  We have experienced some challenges about some posts.  That is the reality.  We are working as much as possible with the Department and others to come up with sustainable solutions to ensure we get good management in place.  We have made some progress relating to that to identify the specific skillset that is required to deliver a programme of this nature.  My colleague has answered the question relating to pay, conditions and the autonomy of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I will now bring in two other members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I want to respond about car parking.

Regarding the naming of the wards, I know the wards in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin have religious names.  I know because I was on Nazareth ward.  Has the hospital group discussed that?  What direction is it headed?<\/p> <p>  I do not know if anybody here has actually parked in Tallaght Hospital multi-storey car park.  It is a test of one's driving skills.  It is particularly testing if somebody in the car is sick.<\/p><p>I have been in many multi-storey car parks in my life and it is probably the most difficult one to get up.  It is very clear when one drives up through it that everybody else has a difficulty because there are metal and paint marks all over the walls.  It is not unique to my driving.  I have been in Tallaght and in Crumlin a number of times.  Parking is the first experience people have whether they are going to see somebody in hospital, which is not as serious, or if they have a sick child in the car.  I have read all the documentation.  I am in favour of the car being taken from people so they can go in with their child in their arms.  Directing people into a very narrow car park is an issue.  If it is going to be tendered out to a private company, I hope that will be considered in the process.  There should not be an obstacle course before people even get in the door of the hospital.  I do not know about other children's hospitals but in Crumlin if one has a child who is an inpatient for a long period of time, there is a voucher system for parking.  People present the voucher - a pink or yellow slip - and do not need to pay for their parking.  If it is tendered out to a private operator, which has paid for the car park and is getting its money to pay back the bills for building it, will the hospital group be invoiced for parking for the parents of the very sick children?  How will it work?  Is it something that has been budgeted for?  Will Ronald McDonald House in Crumlin be defunct?  All the rooms have pull-out beds.  It is fine if people are from Dublin but if they want to wash some clothes for their children or themselves, are there facilities like that for families from outside the greater Dublin area that might not have family in the area?  Are there facilities to organise a bit of food, wash clothes out or prepare things for children?  I understand allowances of certain amounts are authorised out of fundraising money.  It might be an issue for some people so I want to clarify it in case I misinterpreted the witness.  If the hospital group is giving money on a monthly basis to the current children's hospital, many people would be surprised if that was in any way being channelled into salaries.  Will the witnesses clarify that in case anything arises in the committee proceedings which is not entirely correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#J01500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I will start with the safety issue.  I congratulate all involved in bringing the children's hospital to the level it has arrived at.  It is as a result of the dedication of everybody, including the Department of Health and the board, that it has been successfully brought to this stage.  I offer my good wishes for the rest of it as well.<\/p> <p>  I will address the question of safety.  I am a bit worried that if a safety issue arises in the future, everybody will hark back to the situation that developed in the first place in which somebody decided to water down the safety precautions because they were considered unnecessary and too costly.  I would attach a public health warning to that.  It is a dangerous route to go.  I would err on the side of extra expenditure on safety.  Even though it may appear to be duplication, it is hugely important.  It is hugely important to have public confidence in what is taking place and the reasons for it taking place.  Short-changing for the want of a number of sprinklers does not add up to me.  I do not support that notion. <\/p> <p>  The other issue is the car parking.  Car parking is of huge interest to two groups of people - the patients, who are the most important people of all, and the staff.  I have had some discussions with some of the witnesses previously about this.  From the point of view of both patients and staff, it is of critical importance that the car parking be convenient and that it involves the least possible walking time in the open air.  Great effort should be made to ensure it is close to the hospital buildings and that there is not a great distance or that people have to take a bus, which was envisaged.  I do not agree with that at all.  We should put ourselves in the position of a mother or father of a child, who is distressed, distraught and full of anxiety.  The last thing they want to do is waste time finding a place to park and maybe finding themselves clamped when they come back to it, as has happened in other hospitals in the past.  I ask that that be eliminated as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  With regard to philanthropy and the extent to which it could play a part, there is great opportunity for philanthropists to become involved in a positive way that is beneficial to the hospital and to health.  I urge that those issues be examined carefully with a view to ensuring maximum benefit is achieved without impacting on policy or the running of services and facilities.<\/p> <p>  I am a bit concerned about the ownership of the assets.  If the Department of Health owns the assets it could be a problem at some stage in the future.  The ownership of sites is an issue that has raised its head in recent times with regard to the maternity hospital in particular.  I ask that, in so far as possible, the determination of ownership of the surrounding land, which could impact on the operation of the facility itself or could restrict or curtail it in some way, is carefully looked at with a view to ensuring no difficulty arises.<\/p> <p>  The importance of the board goes back to my mantra for many years.  So far the development board has done an excellent job.  In future, the chief executive and development board will be part of a new board.  It is suggested there could be difficulties arising there.  One is non-statutory and the other will have to be a statutory body.  There may be some difficulty in merging the two together, which might need to be examined, with a view to ensuring there is no clash of interests.  We need to ponder that issue for a moment.  For the past 20 years or so every issue associated with health has had commentary from the sidelines attended on it.  The composition of the boards is of such importance that in order to get the kind of cohesive administration a hospital system needs, there should be representative interests on that board.  I am talking about the interests of professional bodies.  Professional bodies need to be represented on the board in some way to ensure the only outlet of people who want to oppose everything is to make a commentary from the sidelines, which impact negatively on the operation involved.  A whole plethora of health services in this country are being dramatically negatively affected by various negative comments on a daily basis.  If I was a health worker, I would not want to be associated with it.  It is a huge burden on the dedicated people who go to work in the health system every day, and who work extremely hard and commit a huge number of hours above and beyond the call of duty, to find that at the same time, there is negative off-stage commentary on their performance.  We need to deal with that particularly in the children's hospital structures.<\/p><p> The Minister will appoint the members of the board and he needs to take into account the need to accommodate, in so far as possible, diverging views without breaching the cohesiveness of the board's mission.  I refer here to the internal views of the board rather than to outside criticism.  If this is a groundbreaking exercise then it is of critical importance to the future of both children's health care and general health care in this country.  It has been handled extremely effectively and efficiently heretofore, but there will always be criticism and because of the nature of this, there will always be second guesses coming from all over.  My advice to the development board, the subsequent board and to everybody associated with these projects is to recognise that there will be a degree of descant commentary at all times, and to try to put in place the structures that will ensure that this does not continue into the future and grow into a virus that cripples the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#K00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Does Deputy O'Reilly have a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#L00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I do.

Perhaps Ms Duffy could explore for us how that will work.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of cost, are the witnesses happy that the funds will be available to complete the project?  There is much controversy over the eventual cost of this project, so perhaps the witnesses might address how the cost projections are going and what the eventual cost may be.

The Phoenix Children's Health certainly has the potential to become an iconic magnet hospital, not only in the Irish context but in the context of world paediatrics.

I want to reiterate that safety is of paramount concern to all of us on this project.  Although the fire safety measures previously proposed already exceeded the standards in health care design, An Bord Plean&aacute;la included additional stipulations and these will be absolutely adhered to.  We have appropriate governance structures in place for this project and we will make sure that all safety concerns are taken on board as part of our overriding concern for the public.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Durkan's question, I will clarify the matter of the boards.  Two boards are involved here.  One we simply call the \"building board\" or the National Paediatric Development Board, and this is already on a statutory footing.  On the service side we currently have the administrative hospital group made up of the three children's hospitals.  We are very anxious to put that administrative board on a statutory footing.  All of us involved in the project are very clear about the complementary roles of both boards.  Our governance structures oversee both the build side and the service integration side of the project and we make sure that both sides work well together, that they do not overlap inappropriately, and that they are clear about their own distinct roles.  I am satisfied that our statutory development board and our administrative board are both working well and that the latter will work even better when we put it on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Minister appointing the board, we had said that the board was to be made of people with experience and expertise.  We put a lot of consideration into how it would be appropriate to populate a board with this kind of governance role.  Rather than including representatives of various interests, we felt it appropriate to get the right mix of clinical, financial, legal, public sector and significant change management skills, and to bring a group of people together with those skills and competencies.  This obviously includes clinical expertise so the voice of the clinical world can indeed be on this group; it is one of the core memberships already envisaged here and it is very important that we have that.  On our current board we have clinical representation, not only from our own sector here, but also from the CEO of Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.  This brings an international clinical dimension and thinking that will help our learning and improve our services.  Also on the board we have a former deputy chief medical officer, CMO, from Northern Ireland who is currently CEO of a trust there.  We are trying then to bring together the right mix of voices and skills to represent all of the communities at the core of the function of this hospital.  We consider this to be very important.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hardiman might elaborate on the philanthropy issue as well as on how the car parking situation is envisaged.  On the issue of assets, this project is funded by the State; the land that the facility will be on is owned by the State; and the buildings will be owned by the State.  Part of the due diligence pre-commencement work under way is to ensure that there are appropriate lease arrangements in place so that the hospital can function and operate appropriately.  <\/p> <p>  With regard costs, we had a significant discussion of this back when the Government approved the construction investment decision in April.  As we publicly communicated at the time, the overall capital cost of this project amounts to &euro;983 million.  A total of &euro;960 million of that will be funded by the Exchequer.  We have in place a governance system; a steering group under the chairmanship of the chief operating officer in the HSE and with all the relevant stakeholders around the table; and a board chaired by our own Secretary General.  These will ensure that the project will be delivered within the timescale, scope and funding that we have set out for Government.  We have very tight control over all of the parameters involved to ensure the project is delivered within the appropriate budget.<\/p> <p>  The remaining question was more operational and may be best answered by Ms Hardiman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fionnuala Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":784,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy O'Connell's question about ward names, we have not moved onto that level yet, although we consider it important that the overall name for the hospital be taken into account.  From a design perspective, we are just starting to move into the way-finding stage so it is appropriate that our approach be consistent.  There is no desire to represent religious connotations because the new hospital is, if anything, a secular hospital that represents both the population it will serve and contemporary approaches to delivering health care.<\/p> <p>  Having been the CEO in Tallaght Hospital, I could spend much time talking about the car park there.  I completely understand that car parking is an issue.  I should, of course, say that the Tallaght car park was designed in accordance to the standards at that time.<\/p><p>I am aware of that from my previous role and am pleased to offer some assurance to the committee in this regard.  There are 675 parking spaces allocated for the new children's hospital, which is three times the number available across the existing hospitals.  The allocation is based on a robust identification of the needs of the families who will access the new facility.  Some 22 of the places will be outside the emergency department, where it will be possible to drop and run.  It is important to note that the planning application that was secured includes a stipulation regarding the car park design.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la sought to have the size of some of the spaces increased, having listened to the concerns of the people who attended the oral hearing.  Many of those attendees have children who come with a lot of equipment, chairs, oxygen and so on, which require adequate space to unload, and, in addition, many of the families require large family vehicles to accommodate all that equipment.  As I said, the provision regarding parking is a planning stipulation and whichever car park provider secures the contract will have to adhere to it.  Members are correct that the existing hospitals include a derogation in respect of parking charges for hardship cases and where children are in hospital on a long-term basis.  For the new hospital, we have identified 100 spaces within the car park which will not be taken into account from a business case perspective.  In other words, they will be available to parents at a reduced fee or free of charge, depending on circumstances.<\/p><p> In regard to Ronald McDonald House, we see it as a key partner in delivering our plans for children's health care.  Many of the children who require hospital treatment, including those from outside Dublin, have long stays.  The best international comparators show that charities such as Ronald McDonald House provide important services to families.  As part of the planning permission for the new hospital, we have secured approval for a 53-bedroom building right outside the front door which will be available for use by families.  We are working with Ronald McDonald House on how to progress the construction of that building and decide how it will operate.  The hospital will comprise all single rooms and we will have fantastic facilities within those rooms, including an appropriate bed for parents to sleep in and an en suite bathroom.  We recognise the need for a family lounge within the hospital and we have provided for that.  There are an additional 30 beds within that area which will include showers and facilities where parents can work, eat and engage in other normal day-to-day activities.  We are aware that some of the parents currently attending their children at Crumlin cannot even get to the Ronald McDonald House facility there.<\/p><p> To clarify, when I answered the question in regard to management and adhering to the pay scales, I was simply pointing out that we are very much working within the process that is there.  The practice of using fundraising as a top-up to funding of staff costs is not reflective of the policy position within the existing hospitals and not something we want to see.  There are challenges in this regard, of course, and we need to work within the parameters defined by pay policies.  The board will have an opportunity to discuss any specific challenges in respect of staff recruitment with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance, as any good board would do in seeking to secure the best people for its service.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan referred to safety issues, which are a key consideration of our design.  Some of the safety issues we face are unique to hospitals.  We already have members of staff in our hospitals who have a legal remit to ensure safety parameters are being adhered to, with those staff being answerable to the chief executive officer of the hospital.  I assure members that this safety function has been built into the design of the new hospital and there will be members of staff operating those systems when the hospital begins operation.  Moreover, we have undertaken a number of external reviews to provide us with assurances around compliance to standards, particularly those standards that are unique to hospital buildings.  This helps to ensure the decisions we are making in the design and building process are in accordance with the recognised standards in health care.<\/p><p> I already spoke about car parking facilities and the importance of ensuring that provision meets the requirements of families.  Parents manage to get to our existing hospitals, including Temple Street, for example, which is right in the city centre, but when they get there, parking is the challenge.  That is why we have made such an issue of it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted our proposals in this regard, which were objectively measured on the basis of future use of the hospital.<\/p><p> I agree there is a huge opportunity around philanthropy, but it needs to be managed very well.  We have a good basis there with the existing foundations but there is a chance now to lead out on this issue in a way that will ensure we can avail of any opportunities that arise in a manner similar to other international children's hospitals.<\/p><p> On the question of the composition of the hospital board, I take the point that it is important that the voice of staff be heeded.  Regarding the competencies of the current board, three of the members have come from health systems, including paediatric health systems, where quality and safety are very much the focus.  That is at the core of what we are trying to do from a services perspective.  The board is there to provide strategic direction and ensure good governance and oversight.  We envisage implementing clinical directorates and chief medical officer posts that will provide very clear clinical leadership and executive leadership of services.  Those clinical and executive staff will be in attendance at board meetings and a structure will be in place whereby their voices will be heard and the board will have an opportunity to seek out their views.<\/p><p> Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked about the difference between core and non-core staff.  As we know, there are very formal arrangements in place for how one staffs the public sector, and we will be adhering to those requirements.  Of course, there is a multiplicity of posts within hospitals which have a big impact in terms of making the services to patients better.  People's experience of hospital is reflective of all the staff they meet there, from the first person they meet when they come into the car park to the last person they see before they leave.  We will work through the process that is there to ensure the mix is correct.  Any challenges that arise are often to do with communications with staff as opposed to their being any reflection of the competencies of core clinical staff.<\/p><p> On fundraising and philanthropy, we have mapped out three potential phases in which we will approach this issue.  We absolutely accept that the three current foundations do very good work for the existing hospitals, including in education, research, providing patient comforts and equipment and, in some cases, refurbishing facilities.  The board has made a commitment that this will continue while those hospitals still have children being treated.  We also will have a philanthropic capital campaign, as any major children's hospital build does, to enable us to seek funding in addition to what is provided by the State.  We have agreed that with the merger of the three foundations and the development of a philanthropic capital campaign, our future strategy in this area will predominantly be focused on a concerted effort around research, education, innovation and improving patient comforts.  With our beautiful new building in place, we hope to have the facilities and equipment we need to deliver services when we open in 2022.<\/p><p> Finally, on the question of parking fees, the charges levied will be based on the market rate, as reflective of what is being charged in other hospitals in Dublin.  It is usual practice to seek to have a consistency in this regard as between the various hospitals.  I assure members once again that in hardship cases and where a child is in hospital for a lengthy stay, parents will be able to avail of a derogation, which is to be accommodated by the setting aside of 100 parking spaces for that purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":786,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for providing their expert opinion on the proposed legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017102500002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508918400,"counter":787,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11 a.m. until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 November 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government","time":1508944200,"counter":788},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 16:10<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Barry,* Deputy Mattie McGrath, Deputy Pat Casey, Deputy Eoin \u00d3 Broin, Deputy Barry Cowen, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.

Part of it is because I do not think it will be able to get it done within a 12 month period but also because I think that water consumption will change given that people will then know that this review is happening and, therefore, if there is a longer period over which that review is undertaken, we might see reduction, leak fixes, etc., so we would get a more accurate picture at the end of the 24 months.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 15 is probably a more substantive one.  For those of us who were members of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, if we dare to recollect that particular experience, one of the big disagreements involved the unit for calculating average usage.  Is it the household, which was the Fine Gael position, or is it the individual, which was the Fianna F&aacute;il position?  From the way the Bill is worded, particularly this business of having a threshold of a household of four persons, there seems to be a fudge.  The problem with that fudge is that it creates all sorts of anomalies so a household of five may be able to get some kind of additional allowance if this Bill goes through but a family of four, three or two will not.  Therefore, it appears that a circumstance will arise where a family of three or four could be treated exactly the same as a family of one or two for the purposes of the threshold allowance, which is very significant.  While I am not in favour of the Bill at all, it seems that having a per person usage right across the board so that the household calculation would be per person, whether that involves one, two, three or four households, is the only correct way to do it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 16 is just a technical thing so it does not really need speaking to.  It is typographical.  In respect of amendment No. 17, if the CER is going to carry out the review, for us, one of the most interesting things that emerged from the Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services involved the figures we received demonstrating that average usage in terms of litres per person per day was one of the lowest in the OECD.  Therefore, it is vital that this type of international comparison is included in the review of the CER.  Therefore, I want that named specifically, which is amendment No. 17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#D00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 15, particularly as the Bill relates to three and four-person households, especially four-person households.<\/p><p>What the Minister and the supporters of the Bill have been saying is that the so-called excessive use charge, the penalty, will only apply to what are being described as water wasters, 8% of consumers of water in the State.  The way in which the Bill is constructed means that for a one, two, three and four-person household one gauges it on the basis of average household size, 2.75, which means that if it is a one or two-person household one would want to be using a hell of a lot of water.  A three-person household is slightly discriminated against but a four-person household is really discriminated against.  It means in reality that if a four-person household uses anything more than 1.16 times the average, it will then be hit with the excessive use charge.  In other words, a four-person household which uses 17% more water than the average, which is only slightly so, will be hit with an excessive use charge when the excessive use charge comes in on 1 July 2019.  In less than two years' time a four-person household which uses 17% more water than the average will get hit with an excessive use charge which in my view is water charges through the back door or by another name.<\/p><p> I do not have statistical data to hand on this but I would imagine there are probably more four-person households now than was the case in previous years given the number of young adults who are unable to purchase their own home or pay rent for private rented accommodation and who are staying at home with their parents.  According to the Central Statistics Office in the census of 2016, a total of 500,000 young adults are staying at home with their parents.  I do not expect the Minister or Fine Gael to change their position.  I am posing the question most sharply to the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives on the committee.  Are they going to stand over a section of the Bill which says that a four-person household will be charged an excessive use charge, water charges by another name, in less than two years' time if they use less than 20% above the average water usage?  There needs to be some debate on this topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#D00900","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":851,"content":"<p>In a previous job I was looking at statistics on the number of persons per household nationally.

How is it proposed to distinguish between four people in a household with a single parent and three children or a household with four adults?  The use per type of person is different.<\/p> <p>  My other concern relates to people who have a requirement for a significantly increased allowance of water due to medical reasons.  How will each household be checked?  I would expect it to be quite difficult to verify.  One could be told there are six people living a house.

I remember that when the Oireachtas committee discussed the issues with the experts, workers in the Oireachtas asked members of Fianna F&aacute;il what it meant and they said they were okay, that they would not have to worry about paying water charges because they had it under control, as such.  This now means that families of three and four or higher will be considered to have excessive use once they go over 17% of the average use.

I support what has already been said by some of the other members.  The problem is that we are defining wastage as normal household use where there are more people living in the house.  That strikes me as the essence of what is being said.  If one calculates per household rather than per person the more people there are in the house then they are considered water wasters.  That is the complete opposite to what this Bill should intend to do.  It was shown by the special committee that the wastage happens at the point of leakages not at the point of use.  If we are going to go after the wastage then we should go after the leaks, which by and large are in the main part of the system rather than in individual households.  Therefore, I argue for the deletion of the entire section because of its definition of wasters.  Wasters are not another two or three people living in a house, they are people who do not fix the leaks, who have responsibility for the gross waste of water through leakages in towns and cities.  That amounts to Irish Water and in the past it was the local authorities and overall it amounts to what the Oireachtas decides to do in relation to this very essential service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#E00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I will speak to each individual amendment if I may and then I will answer some of the questions that were raised.  In regard to amendment No. 13, the review to be carried out by the regulator will assess the rate of demand for water services in dwellings over a 12-month period.  We can expect that usage over a 24-month period will be twice the annual usage so 12 months is being set down as a reasonable time to determine exactly what the average usage might be in the dwelling in question.  Therefore, I cannot accept that amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 14 seeks to remove certain subsections in relation to what the commission should consider when carrying out the review.  The amendment proposed seeks to remove the provision to assess the rate of demand for services by individuals and in dwellings.  As that is integral to the Bill itself I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  In regard to amendment No. 15, the regulator has published data on water consumption and I will come back to that in a moment.  I will not be accepting the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 relate to international comparisons.  The review being carried out by the regulator will be based on actual consumption patterns.<\/p><p>I accept the Deputy's point about information on international consumption patterns and how it might be useful.  Section 53(7)(b) sets out matters to which the Minister will have regard when making an order setting a threshold.  One of these matters is the need to promote the conservation of water and the sustainable management of water resources.  In that context, the Minister of the day could consider international consumption patterns.  I can give a commitment that he or she would do so.  It is also important that the water forum advise that international consumption patterns be referred to in that regard.  I, therefore, ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.<\/p><p> To respond to some of the questions asked, ideally we would raise no money from the excessive use charge.  This is about conservation.  We want to tackle the 8% who are using almost one third of water supplies.  We are anxious to use the period beforehand, the 12 months of review and the six months when a notice is issued to a household going over the excessive usage amount to have their consumption cut and the leaks fixed.  That is the intention; it is not to find a new revenue stream for Irish Water.<\/p><p> The allowance is not 17% more.  It is almost twice the average use per person when one considers the average consumption used for a four person household multiplied by 1.7.  Given the data produced by the CER which will become the CRU, it will accommodate eight people.  There is more than enough of an allowance for a household.  Whether it is one adult and three children or four adults, the 1.7 multiplier will accommodate significantly more water for each of the individuals in the household.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the average number of people per household is 2.7; therefore, we are allowing for an average household of four, which is generous.  Just over 70% of households in the State comprise four people or fewer.  The allowances being provided are very generous.  Again, we are trying to find the 8% who are using 30% of the water supplied and tackle this as a conservation measure.<\/p><p> Medical need is addressed later in the Bill.  There can be an exemption for a household because of medical need.  What \"ordinarily resident\" or \"ordinary residing\" means is dealt with later in the Bill.  It will be addressed through regulations.  If somebody is going off to college for five days per week, he or she will be considered to be ordinarily resident.  That individual would not have excessive usage.<\/p><p> On how we calculate the figure, it is not just about looking at the household and not at the person.  We are looking at both.  We will allow for four people in terms of average household use.  With the excessive use charge set at 1.7, based on the data we have seen to date, it will potentially allow for an additional four more.  However, if there is another person living in the household, the household can apply for an additional usage allowance for that individual to be added to the average usage allowance which will cover four persons, although it is more than four when one considers the 1.7 multiplier.  It is more than generous.  This is about conservation, fixing leaks and ensuring we will have sound investment in water infrastructure into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#E00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I am not sure that is what the Bill will do.  It might be what the Minister intends it to do, but we can discuss some of the questions in that regard as we go through the sections.<\/p> <p>  First, I remind the committee what the Oireachtas committee recommended in its report before teasing out some of what the Minister said.  Section 4.4 states: \"The Committee recommends that the CER should determine average consumption levels setting the threshold level at 1.7 times the average household usage\".  That is the figure of 2.6 in the CER's recommendation at the time.  It continues: \"The legislation should also provide for appropriate allowances for extraordinary circumstances such as medical conditions and above the average household size [that is, households above 2.6 or 2.7] that falls beyond the threshold allowance and taking into consideration that the average usage per person is 133 litres per person per day\".  My reading of the legislation is that where it refers to average households, it still refers to a figure of 2.6 or 2.7.  The Minister tells us that there is a change and that the average household, for the purposes of the legislation and the CER determining what the average household threshold will be, is four.  Will he point to where that is explicit in the legislation as that is not my reading of the Bill?  When it refers to average household usage, the implication throughout the Bill is that the figure is 2.6 or 2.7.  The figure four comes into it for the purposes of determining the allowance above average household usage.  That is where the concern arises.<\/p> <p>  Some of this goes to the heart of what the Minister said.  He said this was not about a revenue stream, but I am not convinced.  In the first instance, it is demonstrating a revenue stream in order that the Minister can go to the European Commission and say that although it might not be the full revenue stream the Government originally wanted, there is still a revenue stream.  As everybody knows, the legislation allows for the prospect being available to this or future Governments to increase the revenue stream.  Regardless of whether that is the intention of the Minister, it is built into the proposal, as it stands.<\/p> <p>  There is value in international usage figures being included in the CER's considerations.  I accept and welcome the fact that the Minister will look at them at the point of determining the threshold.  As the debate proceeded from the public deliberations and commentary on the Oireachtas water committee, the notion that we had a problem with wastage took hold, a problem where small numbers of people are wasting large volumes of water.  The CER tells us that there is a small number of households that are using a larger than average amount of water, but there is no evidence to suggest there is wastage.  One of the strongest facts which is included in our original report and was reported to the committee is that average litres per person per day usage is significantly below the OECD and EU average.  There is a need, therefore, for it to be included in the deliberations and considerations of the CER, as well as with regard to what the Minister suggested in terms of the considerations of the Minister at a later stage.  However, it is very important at this point that we have clarity on the average household and the purpose in having four persons in the calculation of the additional allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#F00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I appreciate what the Minister said and support the Bill.  However, I am still not clear on the use of the word \"ordinary\".

For example, I might say there are seven people living in a house when there might only be two.  I could, therefore, leave the taps on all day.  I am not suggesting anybody would do so, but I have no doubt that it might happen.  There will be a grave difficulty in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am still concerned about a point I made earlier.  I appreciate that a single parent will usually, although not always, have young children.  Single parents were identified as a vulnerable group.  It might be more to do with their income or capacity to pay water charges if they had to pay them.  I do not see an exemption for persons in that category.  Perhaps it is not intended because, regardless of whether people are in that group, the Minister could argue that they did not use excessive amounts of water.  I am also concerned about children, teenagers and older people who use a lot of water.  It will have an impact depending on the person involved.  That is the reason the volumes are important.  I accept that 70% of households comprise four or fewer people.<\/p> <p>  I am still concerned about the use of the word \"ordinary\" and defining it.

Essentially it does not matter what the average household number is.  Deputy Barry Cowen explained it quite well.  The provision will mean that any household with more than four people will be able to apply for an additional allowance, per person, above four, but where there are four people, the average consumption will be calculated by Irish Water not based on the usage divided by the number of people in a house but on the usage divided by the number of customers, that is, the number of households.  That brings us to a figure that effectively covers four people in terms of cubic metres on an annual basis.  We are stating in the section that if there is a person in the house in addition to the four, one can apply for the additional person allowance in cubic metres.  Notwithstanding this, there is an allowance of 1.7 on top of it for excess usage which, based on all of the available data, will actually cover eight persons in a household.  Again, this speaks to Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's point about making sure a single parent with three young children will be more than provided for by the provision concerning an average household of four and the additional allowance of 1.7 above it.<\/p> <p>  On the point about international comparisons, international comparisons are welcome, but I do not believe this legislation is the place for them.

As far as we are concerned this is a Trojan horse, which builds into the legislation the possibility of the reintroduction of water charges through the back door because if the excessive use charge is set at 1.7 times the average, that is, households using 70% more than the average, it might be true that only 8% of households will be caught with that now.  The legislation, however, also allows for the D&aacute;il in five years' time to reduce the figure of 1.7.  Our amendments to that have been ruled out of order.  In five years' time the D&aacute;il if it wishes can reduce the figure of 1.7 and as it progressively reduces, it potentially draws more and more people under the heading of the excessive use charge, which effectively brings in water charges through the back door.<\/p> <p>  It has been argued that by opposing the excessive use charge we are opposed to the idea of massive wastage of water.  We are not opposed to luxury use of water, such as water features in gardens or swimming pools, but if there is massive waste of water or in reality, luxury use of water, we will support that.

It may seem to some members that this is a symbolic or superficial change but it is quite important.  Part of the opposition to domestic metered water charges was opposition to the commodification of water as a public good or service and the fear based on what has been happening across the world of eventual privatisation.  This amendment seeks to make clear that the people who access water in the public system are not customers.  We do not call pupils in schools customers of education services but we call them pupils.  We do not call patients in hospitals customers but we call them patients.  Just as water is a public good and public service, we should call the consumers, in this instance, households.  In some senses this goes to the very heart of the difficulties we have had with water policy.  This is really about saying people are not customers and we are not commodifying water.  The Minister on Second Stage made it clear the water charges regime, as originally introduced by a former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Phil Hogan, is gone.  The majority of the people and households - we do not know how many as of yet - will not pay charges and will not be in any kind of exchange relationship so cannot be regarded as customers.  This is something I feel very strongly about and it is why in all the relevant sections of the text I have replaced &quot;customer&quot; with &quot;household&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#M00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#M00600","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>We have not yet had the chance to discuss the public ownership element around the debate but we will, very shortly, on Committee Stage of one of the Member's Bills.

Notwithstanding my opposition to the Bill, I welcome this element and it is important it is got right.  One concern is that there are several cases in other institutions where there is some type of medical exemption or medical threshold.  For example, in South Dublin County Council, there is a medical priority on the housing list.  People submit a certain type of medical documentation but it is not council officials who determine it.  Instead, a senior HSE official makes an assessment of that information for the local authority.<\/p><p>Who will make these assessments in the case of exemptions from water charges?  Will it be Irish Water staff or somebody with a medical or professional background?  What is the Minister's understanding of the types of illness covered or medical information required?  Again in the case of South Dublin County Council, it will not accept medical information from a GP or a counsellor for the housing priority list.  It has to be at consultant level, a high threshold.  Will the Minister give us as much information as he can on this?<\/p><p>On the specific amendments, the definition in this section needs to be a little bit broader than medical in the sense of some verifiable medical condition to include certain kinds of what might be termed hygiene or social conditions which might not be directly related to a medical illness but might be related to a behaviour which might affect questions of hygiene or volumes of water used.  The first of the three amendments proposes to include not just a health care professional but a social care professional to allow for a broader understanding.  Likewise, amendment No. 45 proposes to include medical or other evidence.  This is not about generalised circumstances but where there might be a hygiene related requirement for additional use of water that, strictly speaking, is not a medical condition.  Amendment No. 46 is consistent with that.  They are all broadly in the same ballpark but are ensuring this particular section is got right in that sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017102500002#Q01600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1508944200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>The intention in this section is not to penalise someone if they are using what might be deemed excessive under the legislation because they have a particular health need which requires them to use additional water.  We will come to this again when deciding the regulations as to who will be in and who will be out.  We will probably need to have some sort of catch-all provision to ensure we do not inadvertently exclude someone we do not mean to.  We can look at other jurisdictions to do this and I come back to the committee to have a consultation on this to ensure we are protecting those vulnerable people who require additional amounts of water.  That is what we want to do with this section.<\/p> <p>  The term \"health professional\" captures the number of people who would have the best say as to who might be included.  Sending it out to a social care worker might be too broad.  It is my intention to ensure we get this right and to consult the committee on this.  There is not a massive rush on this either because we have some time to clarify this and to look to best practice abroad.

I will explain my concern a little bit more to ensure the Minister will consider it when he gets to the stage of drawing up the regulations.  For example, somebody might have hygiene related issues which are indirectly related to mental health, a disability, a history of institutionalisation, or a lack of development of the life skills for independent living.  This is a set of clearly defined circumstances.  My concern is that the way this section is drafted means that someone in such circumstances can say they have a medical condition that, for clear clinical reasons, requires an additional amount of water.  From what the Minister just said, those are the kinds of people he might be attempting to bring into this broader category.  On that basis, I am willing not to press the amendments.<\/p> <p>  The way medical priority works in South Dublin County Council is that a strict link with one's accommodation needs has to be established by a senior medical practitioner.  It is a pretty high bar.  It is not necessarily wrong in the instance of a housing priority allocation.  However, if one replicated that stringent regime and applied it to this exemption, it could exclude categories of people who would legitimately require above-average usage.  It is in those areas which are not demonstrably medical but are behavioural or indirectly related to mental health or disability.  One has to find some way of capturing those.

Sections 54 to 59 give effect to a change in funding sources to and from the local government fund and the central fund arising from the report of the working group on the future funding model for Irish Water.  All of these changes are on an Exchequer neutral  basis and are designed, as I said, to improve transparency to the funding of Irish Water and to ensure that, as recommended, Irish Water will be funded from general taxation.  In summary, section 54 provides that from 2018 the local property tax, which is currently remitted to the central fund, will be remitted directly to the local government fund.  There is no change to the system of administering and collecting LPT by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  Sections 55 to 59 are amendments to the Local Government Act 1998, which established the local government fund, LGF, to provide that motor tax, instead of being transferred to the local government fund, as is currently the case, will be paid to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and then transferred to the Exchequer.  There will be no change to the administrative structures in terms of motor tax collection either online or at motor tax offices and payments in respect of roads and other public transport infrastructure to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which up to now could be made from the local government fund, funded by motor tax, will no longer be possible.  These payments will instead be routed through the Vote of that Department.  Similarly, payments to Irish Water from the local government fund will no longer be possible.

The overarching purpose of the Bill is to protect the family home where the borrower is making a genuine attempt to meet his or her obligations.  The mortgage arrears crisis is not going away.  To the end of the second quarter of 2017, there still remained 73,706 PDH, private dwelling home, or family home mortgages in arrears, with an outstanding balance of &euro;13.6 billion and an amount in arrears of over &euro;2.7 billion.  Of these, close to 52,000 family home mortgages are in arrears by over 90 days, while 32,000 are in arrears by over two years.  Up to 13% of the 120,000 restructured PDH mortgages have fallen back into arrears.  This gives a flavour of the scale of the problem.<\/p> <p>  While restructures are occurring and, in some cases, write-down deals are being done, to date it is inconsistent and unsatisfactory.  Some lenders are reasonable, while others act without regard to the stress and suffering they are inflicting on families and individuals.  Many have cited the fact that the number of repossessions taking place is low.  This, of course, can serve to hide a much greater problem.  According to the Central Bank's statistics for the first half of the year, legal proceedings were initiated in nearly 3,000 arrears cases.  While not all of these will end in repossession on foot of a court order, many will end in the voluntary surrender or sale of the home.  In the first half of 2017, 1,363 family PDHs were lost either through sale, voluntary surrender or repossession.<\/p> <p>  Ideally, mortgage arrears cases should be resolved through agreement between the lender and the borrower using both the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the mortgage arrears resolution process.  While agreements are being reached in some cases, for too many, they are not.  At all points of the process the lender has the final say.  In cases in which the borrower and the lender fail to reach agreement borrowers may have recourse to various options under the Insolvency Service of Ireland which was established under the 2012 legislation and cited at the time as a game changer for personal insolvency and mortgage arrears cases.  It must be acknowledged that it has done a lot of good work and many positive outcomes have been achieved for borrowers in difficult situations.  However, as highlighted by Fianna F&aacute;il and others at the time, giving the banks the power to veto any solution put forward ultimately led to the process not working as well as it should.  Once again, the balance of power lay with the lender.  We were told that removing the veto would be unconstitutional.  However, following a lot of political pressure over time, amending legislation was enacted in 2015 which provided for an appeals mechanism.<\/p><p>That was a step forward.<\/p><p> It is clear that the current system is not working.  From speaking to many personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, who I would like to make it clear are fully independent, it is clear that the process is long and cumbersome, with many cases taking over a year to resolve.  A personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, involves secured debt and, typically, mortgage debt.  According to the latest data from the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the number of new applications for personal insolvency arrangements remains high.  In the first half of the year there were 2,226 new applications.  Approximately 44% of PIA applications have been rejected or the protective certificate in respect of them has expired.  In that regard, it may be the case that in some instances a deal might have been done in the interim.  However, we do not know for sure, but we can confirm that 56% resulted in a yes vote, with 44% being rejected or in respect of which the certificate has expired.  If we are to apply this ratio to new applications, nearly 1,000 will potentially end unsuccessfully.  They will be unsuccessful because the lender has exercised its power of veto or because a deal is not possible.  From talking to PIPs more recently, it certainly seems to be the case that the rejection figure is likely to increase in view of the current situation where the appeals system is not working.  Whichever way one looks a it, many unresolved cases will ultimately lead to the home being lost.  I do not believe we can stand back and leave this situation to develop as it is playing out.  Something needs to change.  PIPs are working tirelessly and diligently in a broken system.  We must grateful for the many PIPs and acknowledge the frustration they must feel when a bank simply just says no to a proposal.  We must listen to what PIPs are saying and they must be part of the solution.  Many to whom I have spoken have indicated that the bank veto is the biggest challenge they face when it comes to personal insolvency and mortgage debt.  I again say the balance of power well and truly remains in the lender&rsquo;s corner, leaving the borrower in a weak and perilous position. <\/p><p> The situation is made worse by the decision in the recent case in the Dublin Circuit Court which was upheld in the High Court.  Under section 115(a) of the Personal Insolvency Act, an appeal can be brought to the court when a bank has used its power to veto a PIA.  In this case the court decided that only a PIP had the legal authority to make such an appeal.  A PIP can now be made personally liable for the cost of such an appeal.  While this is unlikely, it is a risk that many are simply not prepared to take.   Many, of course, will be reluctant to go down that route as a result of this ruling and because of the potential consequences for them and their families.<\/p><p> It is clear that reform is needed.  The Bill will ultimately tackle the bank veto when it comes to the family home.  It is important to remember as we proceed through the process of legislative scrutiny and Committee stage that the Bill focuses solely on mortgage debt on the family home or primary residence.  It has been designed to bring the balance of power back to an even keel.  It is important to note that the Bill does not represent a free-for-all for borrowers.  For some, it creates a moral hazard whereby a borrower will be encouraged to default.  However, under the Bill, the borrower must still engage and co-operate.  An individual who refuses to pay back any money whatsoever, even if he or she has the ability to do so, will not be rewarded when the Bill is enacted.  There are many checks and balances set out within the Bill.  Even if it is enacted, the personal insolvency process will still be stressful for the borrower.  It will still pay for a borrower to stay out of arrears if he or she can do so and when in arrears to move out of that situation as quickly as possible.  <\/p><p> The Bill will only apply to existing arrears cases that were in arrears on or before 1 January 2017.  There is no incentive for a borrower to default.  For the reasons outlined, I do not believe moral hazard will be a pervasive issue if the Bill is enacted.  <\/p><p> I would like to spend a moment going through how the Bill will work in practice.  In the first instance, it will establish a new office within the remit of the Insolvency Service of Ireland which will be called the Mortgage Resolution Office.  The Bill will enable any mortgagor or borrower, a person who is residing in and is a registered owner of a family home, to apply for a mortgage resolution order.  Such a mortgagor must be deemed to be financially restricted where his or her disposable income, non-essential assets and total personal debts are below a prescribed level.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be empowered to make regulations that will set out the prescribed level.  A mortgage resolution order will only be obtained through an application to the Mortgage Resolution Office.  A financially restricted mortgagor will still be able to engage a PIP and utilise the MABS and the Abhaile scheme.  I envisage PIPs having a key role, just as they do in the insolvency process.  Crucially, the Mortgage Resolution Office will be able to refuse the granting of a mortgage resolution order if it is found that the mortgagor is not, in fact, financially restricted or has made false representations.  The financially restricted mortgagor will be required to fully disclose to the Mortgage Resolution Office all accounts held.  Again, if not enough information is provided, the office will be able to refuse to grant an order.  All of the provisions make it certain that the borrower must engage and co-operate.  The financial institution will be required to respond to the application.  If, in its view, the mortgagor is not financially restricted, it will be entitled to make such a submission to the Mortgage Resolution Office which will ultimately decide whether a mortgage resolution order is necessary.  Once an order is in place, a lender will be prevented from initiating legal proceedings against the borrower.  Where legal proceedings are already under way, the court may choose to suspend proceedings pending the outcome of the order. <\/p><p> The purpose of a mortgage resolution order is to find a sustainable solution for those in mortgage arrears and bring some consistency to the overall resolution of the issue.  The Mortgage Resolution Office will arrive at such a solution.  Importantly, it will receive submissions from both the borrower and the lender in each specific case.  The Bill provides it with a suite of options to be used in individual cases.  These options are outlined in section 9 and include all of the normal restructuring options such as a split mortgage; extension of the life of the mortgage; interest-only payments; and, of course, the mortgage to rent scheme.  Further options can, of course, be added.  <\/p><p> There are a number of appeal mechanisms outlined in the Bill, as is normal.  If a financial institution believes the borrower is not financially restricted, it can appeal to the Mortgage Resolution Office to investigate.  Part 3 of the Bill enables both parties to bring an appeal to an appeals office that will be appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality and which will be fully independent.  Where there is a dispute on a point of law, an appeal can be brought to the High Court for guidance. <\/p><p> The Bill is not perfect, as I will be the first to admit.  There are issues that will have to be addressed on Committee and Report Stages.  I will bring forward amendments, where necessary, and will, of course, be open to amendments brought forward by other members.  One issue that I foresee that will have to be addressed is where an individual has other debt that is following the existing personal insolvency process.  We need to define more clearly how the provisions in the Bill will interact and dovetail with the insolvency process where debts other than the family home are involved.  I look forward to working constructively with members of the committee in order that we can make this a better Bill, one which will serve those stuck in the mortgage arrears trap.   I believe the Bill is required to rectify some of the major problems in the current personal insolvency process.  It is required to shift the balance of power back to the middle ground and to protect the family home.  If enacted, not only will it provide a practical solution for many of those in mortgage arrears, it will also provide a strong incentive for a bank to find a sustainable solution before a case reaches the Mortgage Resolution Office.  I know that the banks are very concerned about the Bill and hope it will help to change their practices.  They will no longer be able to just say no because there will be an overarching provision under which an independent office will ultimately be able to impose a solution in each case.  <\/p><p> I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to introduce the Bill and look forward to our discussion on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#A00300","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

A feature of the current Oireachtas is that some good Bills are being held up due to the lack of a money message and this needs to be addressed.  If we do not do anything, as I gather it the situation on the ground is getting worse.  For example, Deputy O'Callaghan will be familiar with the court case on the <i>locus standi <\/i>of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>Let us consider the existing appeal provisions, as set out in section 115A.  This applies where the family home is involved and someone goes through the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the proposal put forward by the PIP is rejected and there is a &quot;No&quot; vote in accordance with the 65% threshold and so on, and the borrower wishes to take the matter further.  As the committee knows, the borrower also has to have been arrears prior to January 2015.  Last night I received a reply to a parliamentary question with up-to-date data on this.  Up to 20 October, there have been 632 applications for appeal under section 115A and the majority of these cases have yet to receive conclusion.  I was provided with a table that sets out a summary of those that have reached conclusion.  The table breaks down the first 180.  Presumably, therefore, 180 of the 632 appeals have reached a conclusion.  Of the 180 that have reached a conclusion, the appeal was approved in 57 of them and, in effect, the veto was removed as a result of the court decision.  That is welcome, but it is only 32% of those that have been concluded.  In 97 cases, the reviews were dismissed by the court, which includes 51 objections that were upheld on consent, and 26 reviews were withdrawn by the debtor.  That is a breakdown of the first 180.  In a small number of cases, an appeal was taken to the High Court and I have a breakdown of the outcomes of appeals to the High Court of Circuit Court decisions.  A total of 18 appeals have been concluded.  In four cases, the reviews were approved, in nine cases they were dismissed and five cases were struck out or withdrawn.<br\/><br\/>The Insolvency Service of Ireland may point out that a deal may have been done in the interim in cases where the reviews were withdrawn by the debtor.  We do not know that, however, and cannot be certain of it.  It is also possible that the borrowers were simply weary and ultimately conceded that they were not going to win.  The reply shows, however, that only 180 of 632 appeals since 2015 have been concluded and that, of those, only 57 have been successful.  That is before the recent court case, which has really put a freeze on the entire process.  PIPs are not going to be prepared to take the risk of potentially being held personally liable for costs.  Therefore, there is a need for amending legislation to clarify the situation and to ensure that debtors have proper <i>locus standi<\/i>and can take the appeals in their own names.  More family homes will be lost unnecessarily if we do not intervene and try to re-balance the existing system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#B00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Is there any suggestion that financial institutions will try to sell on mortgages that are in distress to other entities such as vulture funds or is that just a fear that may happen but for which there is no basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#C00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>There is absolutely a basis for it.

I have a couple of questions which relate to some of the submissions we received from the other groups.

David Hall's organisation has done good work on the issue and has made a lot of progress but many people will end up in the formal insolvency process.  During the debate in 2012 when the insolvency legislation was being introduced initially, there was a debate about the bank veto and the constitutional issue was raised.  We were all told categorically at the time that the advice was it would be unconstitutional not to give the banks a veto.  In 2015, there was a change and an appeal mechanism was introduced where, in certain limited circumstances, a court could ultimately intervene, impose a solution and cut through the veto as such.  That is all fine, but that system is not working.<\/p> <p>  What we have proposed is proportionate and measured and it has the public interest at its heart.  It provides that the independent office can have the final say where the family home is involved.  It is subject to a number of safeguards and there is also an appeals mechanism within the legislation.  We drew on external legal support in drawing up the Bill and the view conveyed to us was that, given the safeguards in place, the appeals mechanism and the criteria for going down this road, which are quite limited and narrow, it stands a very good chance of passing the constitutional test.  For me, that is sufficient to bring forward the Bill.  If the Attorney General has advice on the matter, let us see it in order that we can, if necessary, amend the Bill, put additional safeguards in place and protect the Bill from constitutional challenge, which I think can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#C00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>Has the Minister provided any of the advice received from the Attorney General?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#C00800","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#C00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Has Deputy McGrath seen the amendments proposed by the Insolvency Service of Ireland?

There are in excess of 70,000 cases affected by it, more than 30,000 of which for more than two years.  Deputy Michael McGrath has identified well that, as well as repossessions, there is a significant issue of borrowers voluntarily surrendering their home with all the heartbreak, stress and hardship that causes.  There have been examples in the constituency we share and I am sure the Deputy will be as aware of them as am I.<\/p><p> It is clear from all three submissions, not only from the Deputy but from the Irish Mortgage Holders Association and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, that the key issue here is the bank veto.  Indeed, the Insolvency Service clearly states, significantly, for a statutory organisation, that it is very dissatisfied with the co-operation of creditors as well.  That is the key issue.  It is something that Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying for some time.  We introduced legislation on it in 2013 and it is positive to see it dealt with here as well.  My questions come not only from an area of broad support for the Bill but perhaps a desire to strengthen it as well.  I have a number of quick questions and observations.<\/p><p> The first is in on section 4, which provides that the Minister would have the ability to make regulations on the prescribed level of disposable income etc.  The Insolvency Service has already prescribed levels on such matters as disposable income.  In allowing proposed new different ones to be set by the Minister, is it possible that the Minister of the day could use that power to reduce the scope of this legislation to offer flexibility and assistance to borrowers?  Is there something Deputy McGrath might see wrong with the Insolvency Service's income levels that needs to be addressed?  Is that an area that perhaps could be strengthened?<\/p><p> Deputy Jack Chambers raised the issue of ideas put forward by the Insolvency Service.  As far as I can gather, that comes from the service's belief that establishing a new office would take some time and perhaps it might be better to look at two particular areas to try to resolve this.  The first is that it would become compulsory for the creditor to provide clarity on the manner in which it wishes its debts to be dealt with.  The second is that, in terms of the court review process, creditors would be restricted to only those arguments they raised during the protective certificate period.  If it is possible, Deputy Michael McGrath might comment on that.<\/p><p> Section 12 is all about the process that allows the bank to object to the continuing participation of a family in an order but it seems potentially open-ended.  It seems as though a bank could use this process to draw it out if it did not want to co-operate with the mortgage resolution order.  Is that something on which a deadline should be put?  Should that be tightened up to ensure that banks could not use it vexatiously?<\/p><p> Finally, a category of borrower that has not diminished much in recent years is that of those who are in arrears over 720 days.  Does this Bill deal adequately with them?  Is there enough scope in it to assist those who perhaps are in the greatest need of assistance?<\/p><p> As I stated, my party supported the Bill through Second Stage and looks forward to supporting it through Committee Stage, but if it is possible, I ask Deputy Michael McGrath to comment on those issues with the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#C01400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Those are important questions.<\/p> <p>  First of all, in respect of section 4 of the Bill and the power of the Minister to set out the prescribed levels of income and assets and so on, the intention is that it would mirror the reasonable living guidelines of the Insolvency Service.  That can be made explicitly clear in the section.  There is certainly no intention to have a different entry point as such, in terms of the asset or income situation of the borrower concerned.<\/p> <p>  I have not seen the Insolvency Service submission but I would welcome the suggestion that creditors be required to provide greater clarity during the process as to how they wish to see their debts resolved - that does not go far enough - and the suggestion that they would be restricted in the appeals process to arguments that they made during the protective certificate stage.  What I am hearing back is that they are frustrating the appeal system.  There are affidavits flying backwards and forwards.  They are requiring extra submissions.  They are coming back at the last minute.  Cases are now taking more than a year to go through that whole system.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned correctly that 32,000 family home mortgages are in arrears of two years or more.  When one considers that 57 have come through the appeal system successfully so far, although not all of them went into it, that system is certainly not working.<\/p> <p>  As for section 12, the intention certainly is not that it would be open-ended in terms of the bank appeal.  I am open to inserting an amendment there that places some restriction on the overall length of time that it takes.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in respect of the long-term arrears cases, this is a real problem.  Mr. David Hall's organisation has done a lot of work on this but it is important to give statutory recognition to mortgage-to-rent as an option.  It should be in there as an option for the Insolvency Service or the mortgage resolution office that, in cases where borrowers want to remain in the home, mortgage-to-rent would be an option within the service.  It is important to give expression and statutory recognition to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#D00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>Apologies for being late but I read Deputy Michael McGrath's statement last night.  It is time for this legislation and I commend the Deputy on the work that he is doing.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly support the Bill.  Any measure that prevents borrowers from losing their homes has to be welcomed.  As we all will be aware, Fr. Peter McVerry, who is a wonderful man, said this country is returning to Famine times by evicting families and the Government is not willing to take on vested interests.  Worried family members are coming to us daily because the next step for them is to go into hotels.  I really do commend the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  I just have one comment or question to see the Deputy's thinking on this.  Can we strengthen the legislation by compelling the banks to offer repossessed homes to their original owners at the same price as vulture funds are paying?  I do not know whether that is feasible but I wanted to throw that out there because that is a huge issue.  The vulture funds are able to pick up homes from which borrowers are being evicted.  They are buying them at cheap rates.  Would it not be a better idea to be able to offer the family the home back at that cheap rate?

The core objective of this Bill is to prevent a case getting to that point.  It is to have a system in place that gives the borrower a fighting chance of holding onto his or her home.  It gives the independent office the power to make the final decision.  Outside of the Insolvency Service, there is the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the banks are required to implement the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, programme, but it is the lender who makes the final decision as to whether the mortgage is or can be made sustainable.  The lender makes the final decision as to what restructuring option, if any, will be offered to the borrower.  There is a lack of consistency.  We all have been involved in individual cases, most of which ended fairly well, where the borrower has got some restructuring arrangement put in place but others have been inexplicable cases that looked to be strikingly similar where I have had full oversight of all the facts.  There seems to be an inherent inconsistency, not only between different lenders but sometimes even within individual lenders, as to how cases are being dealt with.  That is not good enough.  What the Insolvency Service has succeeded in doing is bringing a degree of consistency in the treatment of cases that have come before it.<\/p><p>The frustration is that ultimately the lenders can just say &quot;No&quot;.  While we have an appeals mechanism, many people are just worn down and they do not take their case that far.  They give up and in many of the cases where we see voluntary surrender or voluntary sale, they have not even gone through the appeals system.  They have just had enough.  It is dragging on for far too long and people react and deal differently with stress and anxiety.<br\/><br\/>Undoubtedly, the system needs to be accelerated and we need to give an independent office the final say.  The Government's position currently is to let the court have the final say on it.  That is a very adversarial system.  It is very lengthy, very drawn out and very cumbersome.  It is currently completely broken because of the High Court decision in regard to <i>locus standi.  <\/i>That is the core objective.

He deserves credit for the work he has put into it.  It is what we are supposed to be doing in here.  Politicians tend to put a lot of their energies into other areas that are not necessarily fruitful in terms of how we legislate for the country and organise things.  I would like to touch on some of the points the Deputy has raised.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the money message, has the Deputy's party challenged the Taoiseach?  The media are fond of calling it the do-nothing D&aacute;il.  We could make it the do-something D&aacute;il.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach has not been more proactive.  Is this going to go on forever?  It is like a charade.  There will be a queue of Bills.  I heard a statistic that the amount of legislation going through the House in the last 12 months is at a record low.  Has the Deputy's party challenged this situation?  It has an arrangement with the Government.  Is any progress being made in this area?<\/p> <p>  I have not read Deputy McGrath's Bill but I have every intention of reading every word of it.  I will not go into my personal experiences.  However, I have had experience of much of what is going to be in this Bill.  While I am not going to personalise it, I am certainly going to use my experience to scrutinise the Deputy's Bill.  I am looking forward to working through it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy pointed out that in the first half of this year, 1,363 family homes were lost through sale, voluntary surrender or repossession.  The Deputy has given the figures for the appeals system.  Although 632 appeals were made since 2015, only 180 have been dealt with and 32% of them were successful in removing the veto.  Can the Deputy identify why it is taking so long?  Obviously, it is not rocket science in that we realise that the financial institutions, sadly, have played a game of breaking the individuals involved much of the time.  I know many people who have committed suicide because of their problems with debt and the banks and how they were treated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made the point that while restructures are recurring and, in some cases, write-down deals have been done, it is inconsistent and unsatisfactory.  The Deputy has never said a truer word.  It has been like a beauty contest.  I know of many deals that were done and of many that were not done, whether it was by NAMA or the pillar banks.  It is so inconsistent.  Does the Deputy agree that the lack of proper regulation of the area allows them to behave as they see fit and run it as a beauty contest?  Sadly, from all that I have learned over the last few years around this whole area, especially with thousands of people from all over Ireland contacting us about NAMA and the banks, I cannot help feeling that this is a banana republic when it comes to how we do business at this stage.<\/p> <p>  We, in the Oireachtas, have been definitely negligent in that we have not dealt more cleanly with this.  The history books will be unkind to this period of Irish life when they look back on it and on how the failure in banking led to the biggest financial crash and the biggest crash of all types in the history of our State.  We made the least well off suffer the most as a result of it.  Does the Deputy have any clear ideas as to how we deal with this overriding problem where, truth be told, we cannot tell the banks what to do despite the fact they would have been out of business only for the fact they were bailed out by the people?  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy's Bill is certainly welcome even though I have not read it.  The principle of it is definitely a progressive move.  This will address some of our problems in this area.  However, we hear about the constitutional challenge and we have heard so many pronouncements since we came in here in 2011 about what the Attorney General thinks about this, that or the other and never having to give us proof of how he or she has come up with the opinion.  Given the Deputy's role as finance spokesperson within his party, does he have any plans as to how we deal with the overriding problems around all this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#E00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace and call Deputy McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#E00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>In regard to the money message gridlock, I understand that there is contact.  It would not be at my level but there is contact with the Government in an effort to unlock that.  Hopefully, there will be some update on that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the other points the Deputy.  Dealing with the hard facts, of those who go into the insolvency process where a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, is applied for, we have a 56% \"Yes\" vote and 44% is either a \"No\" vote or the protective certificate expires.  Some 24% of that 44% is where the certificate has expired.  We do not know what has happened in those cases.  It could be that a deal has been done in some cases but in others it has not been.  What we know for sure is that 56% is a \"Yes\" vote.  That is at the first stage within the insolvency service.  In regard to the appeals process, there were 632 appeals but only 180 were concluded and, of those, as the Deputy has said, only 57 have been approved.  Everyone will acknowledge that there is a serious problem there.  The issue is how do we deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The approach of lenders is forcing people to seriously examine the bankruptcy option.  That is what some people are doing and it may be the right decision for them but I do not know as I am not an expert on it.  I do not believe that when it comes to resolving a mortgage arrears situation on a family home that a person should have to go bankrupt.  That is not what bankruptcy was designed for.  It should not be necessary.  What is happening in practice in the appeals system is that the lenders are frustrating the process.  That is what I hear directly from people who are involved in it.  There are affidavits flying all over the place and coming in at the last minute, looking for more discovery and more documents.  This is relates to cases that have gone through the full insolvency process.  They are just wearing people down and some people are just giving up.  That is why figures for voluntary sales and voluntary surrenders are so high.<\/p><p>It is often noted that there are very few repossessions in Ireland.  That is because people simply give up and either sell their house or hand the keys back to the bank.  That is what is happening in practice.<\/p><p> The changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears in recent years have had a negative impact, tilting the balance in favour of the lender and leading to a dilution of borrowers' rights.  The changes must be reviewed.  What the banks fear most in any new legislation is that it might cause them to lose control of the situation.  The feedback I have had is that they are very fearful of the Bill I have brought forward because it will mean that they can no longer frustrate the process indefinitely.  An independent office making the final decisions and an appeals mechanism functioning within the process, as I am proposing, will mean that debtors can no longer be dragged through a cumbersome and lengthy court process.  That will transform the landscape for those who are in arrears and genuinely making an effort to address the problem.  The Bill is not a charter for people who refuse to engage and have no interest in servicing their mortgage.  We all know of people who, in some cases, have paid nothing for years and have no intention of paying.  These proposals are for the benefit of debtors who have made full disclosure, are paying what they can and making great sacrifices to keep their home.  We should be on their side.  The Bill is an effort to move in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#E00700","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for his opening statement and responses to members' contributions.

As most committee members will be well aware of the ongoing mortgage arrears crisis from their daily dealings with constituents, I will go through the information as quickly as possible.  <br\/><br\/>The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation is a registered charity which has completed 8,000 deals on behalf of clients, 90% of whom have managed to retain their family home.  Some 20% of all bankruptcies in the State are arranged and managed by us free of charge to our customers.  The mortgage crisis in Ireland has been ongoing for a long time and there have been 120,000 mortgage restructures.  In fact, that figure represents a spin on the data, given that it counts every restructure of every loan, including multiple restructures of each mortgage account.  The reality is that nearly a decade on from the beginning of the financial crisis, the latest figures from the Central Bank show that 73,000 families remain in arrears on their mortgage repayments.  As Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire noted earlier, we are talking about real people and families.  The banks, including the Central Bank of Ireland, talk about loans, but the reality is that the figure of 73,000 loans encompasses in excess of 250,000 people.  Some 32,000 of these families are in arrears for more than two years, but we do not know whether it is three years, seven years or more.<br\/><br\/>Since 2009, there have been many attempts to resolve the mortgage arrears crisis.  Some cases self-resolved with the improvement in the economy, as mortgage holders returned to work and found themselves in a position to restructure their loans.  Others remain trapped in a mortgage arrears spiral where they may be able to make some contribution towards their mortgage repayments but not enough to meet a restructuring amount, as required not only by their bank but also in accordance with the rules mandated by the Central Bank which is, in effect, a silent partner in the failure to find solutions to the crisis.  The remainder of the persons in arrears comprise those who have no ability to pay and are eligible for social housing.  They will end up homeless if their bank seeks a repossession order or proceeds to execute existing proceedings.  In addition, we have the vulture funds which are buying distressed loans and evicting mortgage holders.  Against this background, we set up iCare Housing to ensure, via a mortgage-to-rent arrangement, that as many people as possible could remain in their homes.  The facility to offer mortgage-to-rent arrangements is included in the programme for Government as being a statutory option.  It is imperative, at the very least, that it be a requirement to offer it to eligible mortgage holders prior to any repossession order being granted.<br\/><br\/>It is important to highlight the numbers of those in mortgage arrears and the low levels of resolutions that have been achieved by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  It is not because Mr. Lorcan O'Connor and his team are here that I wish to emphasise the unfairness of blaming the Insolvency Service of Ireland for the lack of progress.  I have been a critic not of the service but the relevant legislation.  The Minister must address the problems with the legislation without delay and I urge the committee to convey to the Department the need for action in that regard.  The ruling on the <i>locus standi<\/i>issue requires personal insolvency practitioners rather than the debtor to make appeals.  This issue did not come from thin air.  The Oireachtas introduced an amendment to the Personal Insolvency Act to allow the banks to have the veto removed.  The banks went to the courts to upend the veto, such is the contempt with which they treat the legislation and individual debtors.  At the core of all this is the determination to retain power.  As we saw in recent weeks on the tracker mortgage issue, there is a consistency in the resolve of the banks and vulture funds to keep the power they possess.  Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill represents a serious attempt to change that dynamic.  He is right that the banks do not like the legislation.  They do not like any of the legislation before the Houses.  Deputy Mick Wallace spoke earlier about a do-nothing D&aacute;il, but, in fact, the banks are petrified of this D&aacute;il because it includes parties and Members who traditionally have not got on with each other but who are showing, for the first time ever, a consistency of approach in protecting debtors.  The banks do not like this.<br\/><br\/>As I said, it is unfair to criticise the Insolvency Service of Ireland for the failure to protect mortgage holders in arrears.  If any criticism is to be levied, it should be directed at the Department of Justice and Equality and the political structure that allows the existing legislative framework to continue in being.  It must be radically overhauled.  We deal with the Insolvency Service of Ireland every day and know that the banks do not engage with it.  They will not engage with customers and will not engage with us.  They will not engage with the State organisation charged with debt management.  That is another consistency in their behaviour.  Radical legislation and action are required to tackle them.  It is the only language they understand.<br\/><br\/>The Insolvency Service of Ireland is processing 300 personal insolvency agreements, PIAs, per quarter.  At that pace of progress, it will take 25 years to resolve the 32,000 cases involving loans in arrears for more than two years, never mind the full complement of 73,000 cases.<\/p><p>I mentioned personal insolvency arrangements and <i>locus standi<\/i>.  It is imperative this committee, as the justice committee, seeks to amend the legislation urgently because, as Deputy McGrath mentioned and Deputy Wallace asked about, 500 personal insolvency appeals have stalled.  They have come to a complete standstill.  Personal insolvency practitioners are required to seek independent legal advice before they can appeal, which is just outrageous.<br\/><br\/>We support the Bill in its entirety and we hope the committee and the D&aacute;il take it on.  Constitutional issues have been mentioned, and I heard Deputy Chambers ask Deputy McGrath about this.  The Attorney General seems to work for one person only.  We do not seem to have advice from the Attorney General as to what can and cannot be done, which would make this entire process lot easier.  It is the same with regard to the tracker issue.<br\/><br\/>There is a minor alternative to what Deputy McGrath proposes.  My job here is to be honest with the committee on behalf of the people we represent.  One of the concerns we have about the Bill is the fear the banks have about it.  We hope they do not sell loans to vulture funds sooner than expected.  This is a genuine concern we have.  At present, there are three pieces of such legislation before the House.  We have grave concerns this would accelerate in some way.  This is why Deputy McGrath's Bill needs to be dealt with speedily and without any hesitation, so it is in being before any vulture sets its hands or claws on any of the family home loans.<br\/><br\/>We believe there should be a vulture tax, and not just a makey-uppy vulture tax but one which reflects sales of family homes to vultures.  We had a nice increase in stamp duty in the budget.  There should be a 50% increase in stamp duty for properties sold to vulture funds by banks.  That would soften their cough very quickly.  We have a housing crisis.  We have had clients who lost their lives and we have clients who struggle daily in battling this.  I am speaking to the converted because all of the committee members deal with people in their constituencies throughout the country.  We have neglected these people for ten years.  Collectively as a society we have caused harm to them and caused them to die or to be injured.<br\/><br\/>We need legislation to tackle these people.  They parade around the place.  Bankers and vultures are running rings around the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and, respectfully, the Government at this moment in time.  This is epitomised by the tracker issue, but it has been going on for ten years with inconsistency upon inconsistency.  We need action and we need the banks to be compelled to engage.  They do not understand the conversations of normality and of engaging and asking.  They need to be told and dragged to the water and not led to it.<br\/><br\/>Those in arrears for more than two years amount to 33,000.  This is the most vulnerable cohort of people.  Many of them have no contribution to pay.  Mortgage to rent is required to be a compulsory component of this to protect people and keep them in the homes.  As Deputy McGrath said, some people here simply will not pay.  Let them knock themselves out.  This is not a charter.  I am not parading around trying to protect a couple of people who want to try to game the system.  Nuke them and good luck.  I will not defend anyone who decides to engage in that behaviour and it is proven.  There are two cohorts of people who cannot pay, one that Deputy McGrath Bill deals with and one that it does not deal with directly but does so indirectly with regard to mortgage to rent.  There is no issue for those who are eligible for social housing and who cannot pay.  Those who can pay something need radical restructure.<br\/><br\/>We are looking, as are others, from a not-for-profit and charity perspective to see whether there is a mechanism for us to buy these loans.  If, say, daddy vulture, for want of a better term, will buy a &euro;300,000 loan from a bank for &euro;100,000 why not let us buy it?  Why not let us radically restructure that loan?  Some will say vulture funds are a great way to deal with debt and absolutely great to write off debt, but they will make people homeless because they have no interest in Ireland or the housing issue here.  Why do we not buy that loan for &euro;100,000 and allow the couple or family who can pay &euro;650 a month do so with a radically restructured loan?  If they are not sold to a charitable organisation then put on a 50% stamp duty and see how that softens their cough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and making a presentation to us this morning.

Although they are supportive of the Bill they think another way to resolve the issue may be to sell these loans to a not-for-profit regulated third party.  Will the witnesses elaborate on this?

Yes, there would be a requirement on the State.  The State has an interest in two of the larger lenders.  It is unclear as to how the Department understands its ownership of those shares, because in most other companies an owner of 70% or more has a level of influence.  I do not think the Department has read the textbook yet.  There are ways by which this could be done.  There are simple ways and complicated ways.  A tax of that magnitude on those distressed properties in the current housing crisis and emergency would be wholly reasonable and would force the issue.  We are talking about buying the loan for &euro;100,000.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest crimes in all of this is the lack of offering back to customers their own homes at a price at which the vulture fund would purchase.  This would allow that mechanism to happen.  The bank would get the same money.  There is no disadvantage to the bank.  It is the vulture fund that would be disadvantaged and we do not have pity for any vulture fund.  The vulture fund would lose.  Our job is to run interference on vulture funds.  iCare Housing was established to ensure the most vulnerable were protected in this regard.  We will look to phase 2, which will run direct interference on vulture funds as fast and aggressively as we humanly can.  This legislation is essential because it is radical and would put on immense pressure.  Something I did not mention is even if the vulture funds buy the loans I hope this legislation would capture it, so it would be a safety net.  There is a mechanism to radically restructure those loans by buying them out.  The ECB is not our friend.  It may very well wake up one morning and decide to instruct banks to move much faster than any of us will ever know, and that is a clear and present danger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>To achieve one of the objectives set out, I presume the witnesses would need a decision by the Government and legislation introduced by the Oireachtas.

The difference between a vulture fund and a not-for-profit is that a vulture fund purchases loans with the intention of realising the value of the security, that is, the houses, whereas a not-for-profit would purchase with a longer-term view.  As we all know, vulture funds look to a time horizon of two to five years.  A not-for-profit would probably be looking at 30 years, similar to an approved housing body.  It would be interested in keeping people in their homes for a very long period and, over that time, giving those people a route back to ownership.

The size, quantum and scale of this problem means that there will not be a one-shoe-fits-everybody solution.  It requires multiple solutions for the different types of people involved.  One of the challenges is that this whole crisis is now seven, eight or nine years old and the problems which have arisen have been left to fester for that long.  It is very much a complementary proposal and suggestion.  We are very supportive of the Bill before the committee at the moment.  It is certainly needed.

There has not been a tsunami of repossessions because of the courts system.  Deputy O'Callaghan would know more about this than me.  The courts system has been friendly towards debtors.  It is not because of the banks' intent.  The banks currently have 17,000 family home repossession proceedings before the courts.  That is not a platform of social justice.  There is a clear intent to throw people out of their homes.  It is only because of varying degrees of interventions from this Parliament and from others that these proceedings have been delayed.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was established; the code of conduct to which Deputy McGrath referred was amended; the bankruptcy period fell from 12 years, to three and then to one; and the veto in the insolvency legislation was removed.  A variety of solutions came along over the past six years which have delayed this inevitability.  This delay gave some people hope.  In some circumstances it was false hope.  The cleanest and simplest way of dealing with this issue from the banking perspective is to sell the loans to vulture funds.  There are currently 32,000 families in arrears of more than two years.  The banks will say that half are not paying.  If one looks at the natural evolution of that situation, there is a risk to 20,000 families.  That number of people would fill Croke Park.

These are the cases which are mostly in the courts and in which the banks are very clearly attempting to undertake repossession.

The Oireachtas now needs to pack their bags and send them home on an uncancelled Ryanair flight as quickly as humanly possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I fully agree with that.

They do not know who to ask for help.  They are terrified of the banks.  It is very intimidating for a family member to go into a bank and have a discussion about such an issue, in particular when they do not get treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  That alone could put people off.  People just do not know how to handle it.  Organisations such as those with which the witnesses are involved are important because people listen, understand and show a little bit of care and that can be life-changing for family members and can help them with the state of their mental health.<\/p> <p>  It was said the banks have the power and they are running rings around the Department and the Government.  Could Mr. Hall elaborate a little on that?  When the banks offer a house to vulture funds and iCare gets involved and makes an offer, how is that received?

Due to the combined pressure of advocacy organisations such as mine and others and Members of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il we have seen a monumental change in the attitude of the banks to receiving us versus vulture funds.  Heretofore, we would not have stood a chance.  That is why this proposal is more relevant now than it ever was before.  In dealing with some of the banks we can see they have not ruled out that option.  Having been successful in launching iCare with significant funding to do what we want to do, that has given us the credibility required.  We have put in place the governance issues that were required to achieve the regulatory standing to receive the funding and the deal we did with AIB, EBS and Haven has now given them some further comfort that this is not just an idea, that there is a regulated entity behind it that has been successful in achieving the required standing to get up and running.<\/p> <p>  To be fair, some members of the banks are humans.  I know we vilify them.  I am one who does so as well but there is a clear differential between bank staff.  We have senior bank staff that have been around for many years who caused great damage in the past.  The situation has evolved and changed and probably one of the most disappointing aspects of the tracker scandal is that we all thought they had changed and we still like to hope they have changed.  I have met people within banks who would prefer to sell homes to us than to vultures.  That is why we are very driven by it because we have a bit of confidence and a little bit of wind behind us in that regard.  Given the option of having people thrown to vultures versus us where they have some chance I know where most people would want to go.<\/p> <p>  Power is absolute when it comes to banks.  We say we own certain banks but as Deputy Wallace said, the entire sector is up and running because we have pumped our money into the banks.  That power has never been relinquished in terms of dealing with the code of conduct; the informality; and the arrears support units not having dedicated phone numbers for dedicated case managers; making phone calls into a team of between 200 and 600 in certain circumstances and; having one's third party information, notes, potentially one's medical notes and times of crisis relayed to one from a client management system on a screen up to and including writing off debt.  Many of the people referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in terms of social housing provisions are still in their homes even though they are eligible for social housing but they will not leave because they would be homeless.  They have to fight for HAP and emergency accommodation.  One of the key considerations is that despite knowing they are eligible for the mortgage-to-rent scheme and social housing the bank will not write off their debt but expect them to surrender their property.<\/p> <p>  The power imbalance is monumental and it will have a critical effect on resolving this issue.  It will take a long time to resolve.  As Mr. Curtis mentioned, there are multiple parts required.  Effectively, an emergency response is required where the Insolvency Service of Ireland is beefed up with Deputy Michael McGrath's legislation.  We need to have the mortgage-to-rent scheme on a statutory basis.  Clear directions must be given from the presidents of the various courts.  In circumstances where somebody is eligible for a restructure of the loan or a mortgage-to-rent arrangement no repossession order should be given to any institution in the State.  Then we could try to move on and resolve this crisis.  We are not resolving it.  We are messing around and spinning numbers.  The Department of Finance stated there were 120,000 restructures.  There were never 120,000 people in arrears in the country.  Every single loan that got six months extension was classed as a restructure.  They were celebrating restructures.  When one has got that dishonesty the banks feel protected and they always will feel protected.  All one has to do is look at the last ten days to see the running around that has happened and the power the banks have.  It is deeply concerning that they still retain that power.  They now need to have that power removed.  The only place that can happen is in the courts or in these Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>We were asked what kind of response we get in relation to the vulture funds.

There is a template and a roadmap in place and we can go to every bank in the country and say we can do what it wants from the vulture funds, which is simply to move this on and to get some money for it but we can do it in a way that leaves people in their homes, that gives them security about where they are going to go and gives them certainty for the decades to come.

They have played an important role in articulating precisely the common sense approach that is sadly lacking.  The <i>Waterford Whispers News<\/i>article in which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, points his finger at the banks, saying &quot;bad bank&quot;, &quot;very bad bank&quot;, &quot;bold, bold bank&quot;, while at the same time they carry on regardless probably best sums up the situation we are in.  While I accept the point that people across the House have grappled with these issues, the reality is that they have not succeeded precisely because they paid homage to the banks.  The same applies to the vulture funds.  Many people will welcome that there is now an organisation bidding against them.  Yesterday, I received a message from a friend who had received a letter that morning stating that his loan, presumably along with a batch of others, was being sold by Dankse Bank.  Upon inquiry, he learned that the loans were being transferred to Cerberus.  His attitude is if Dankse Bank is getting a write-down on his loan because of his tracker rate, why can he not avail of that and get a new loan, thereby freeing up money that he is dumping into a bank to be spent in the local economy, which would be a win-win for everybody?<\/p><p>I have two questions for the witnesses.  Mr. Hall referenced a quicker move to have property sold because of this legislation.  The legislative process is incredibly slow.  It takes approximately two years to have priority legislation enacted, which is a joke.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on the size of the bundles of loans, the mechanics behind a speedier process and the proposed timeframe in that regard.  I agree that a speedier process is possible.  My second question relates to bidding against the vulture funds.  I think that would be hugely welcomed.  If the witnesses know of anything we can practically do in that regard, I think everybody would be happy to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#K00100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's last point, what members have been doing collectively and individually throughout this crisis has put the focus on the vulture funds and their behaviour.  Some will say vulture funds write off debt.  They do, but they also make people homeless.  If a person wants to rid himself or herself of assets and have his or her debt written off, vulture funds is the place to go.  We are not in that business.  We are in the business of housing people, keeping people in their homes and allowing them time to recover.  In regard to the Deputy's point about a win-win, one of the biggest win-wins is that there is no cost from this to the State.  Mortgage-to-rent costs the State, but it was always going to cost the State anyway.<\/p> <p>  In regard to radically restructuring loans, Mary and Joe pay the &euro;650 on their &euro;300,000 loan that they cannot service.  There is no State intervention.  What is proposed would be a phenomenal win for the State not only in terms of mental health costs, but in terms of people being able to remain in their homes and dealing with issues.  One of the most important features of this is that there is no State subsidy required.  In regard to the size of the batches, they are frightfully high.  There are a number of rule changes coming into effect in the first quarter of next year under which the European Central Bank, ECB, is requiring the banks to make provision for greater amounts of money against non-performing loans.  Non-performing loans are the issue.  Many of the large firms in Dublin are now changing their entire structure to advising banks on how to deal with non-performing loans, such is the risk to them.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to products like split-mortgages, serious questions are now being raised around the parked amount of money, where it falls in a non-performing loan and the capital allocation component of it.  The landscape is changing.  It is becoming more aggressive.  I am concerned about the synchronisation that is going on.  Banks synchronise things.  They will synchronise the press statements today after the sheriff gives them the go ahead.  Another issue is the banks' synchronisation of the sale of loans.  They are powerful if they sell loans together.  If all of the banks in quick succession release loans to the vulture funds collectively, they give themselves phenomenal political cover.  This is a campaign.  It is hand combat with vulture funds.  There is no polite way of saying it: this is war on vulture funds to protect a significant number of family homes.  This is not pie in the sky stuff, and it is doable, but it requires an orchestrated campaign on the negatives of vulture funds, which is continuing, and actual solutions.  What we need is a body to take on these loans and manage them sympathetically.  We are not asking anybody to roll over.  Anybody who thinks they can game the system will find themselves at the end of repossession proceedings.  This is about helping the majority of people who are in trouble.<\/p> <p>  As I said, this is possible.  The number of loans involved is enormous.  We are speaking not only about loan sales, but tens of thousands of people, men, women, children and grandparents.  Many qualified and educated people, and others, assume that these people are well able to deal with debt.  Debt cripples and crushes them and so there needs to be a direct radical intervention to assist them.  This legislation in conjunction with other legislation will send out a clear message and, hopefully, move loans and families away from vulture funds into arms that might provide them with some chance of remaining in their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>As there are no other members indicating at this point in our engagement on Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill, I thank Mr. Hall and Mr. Curtis for their respective contributions.

Following on from this morning's session, it is clear that the committee is fully aware of the mortgage arrears problem in this country.  While the overall number of mortgage accounts in arrears has been falling every quarter since 2013, there are still more than 70,000 mortgage accounts in arrears.<\/p><p>These accounts represent more than &euro;13.5 billion of debt and roughly 10% of all mortgage accounts held in this country.  More than 30,000 of those accounts are in arrears of more than 720 days which, by their nature, means that they are the most complex to solve.  The Central Bank reported that at the end of June of this year, 120,000 family home mortgage accounts were restructured on an informal basis.  Where these restructurings have been done on a sustainable basis, they are to be welcomed.  It is important to remember that there are people and very distressed families behind these statistics.  In working closely with debtors and debtor advocacy groups, the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, is all too aware of the impact mortgage arrears can have on debtors.  It affects their physical and mental health but it goes further.  It can also have a significant detrimental effect on the well-being of the wider family.  The challenge for us all is clear: to find permanent sustainable solutions for as many as possible of the remaining mortgage accounts that are in arrears.  It is apparent to me that the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017 has this objective at its core.  I will be happy to address any specific questions that the committee might have concerning the Bill, but before that I wish to address briefly two areas at this stage, namely, an appraisal of the existing personal insolvency legislation and some high-level observations around the proposed Bill.<br\/><br\/>Prior to 2013, personal insolvency legislation in Ireland was outdated.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 established the ISI as the independent statutory body responsible for all personal insolvency matters.  It brought Ireland in line with international best practice and went one important step further with the introduction of the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA.  This solution seeks to restructure or settle secured debt within voluntary arrangements, something that had not been attempted elsewhere.  Members will note that included in appendix 1 to this submission are examples of where PIAs have returned people to solvency while keeping them in their home.  These personal stories represent debtors and families who were in real fear of losing their homes.  Personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, who are the professional advisers we regulate across the country, were able to find a sustainable solution to their problem debt, including their mortgage, that saw them stay in their home.  Further testimonials are available on our website.  Members will note one strong theme across the testimonials above all others, which is the huge sense of relief experienced by debtors when they secure a permanent solution that returns them to solvency.<br\/><br\/>Since opening, the ISI has returned almost 6,000 debtors to solvency.  Approximately 2,000 of those cases were PIAs dealing with mortgage debt.  In more than 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their home.  That, in my view, is a very significant achievement.  International experience shows that it takes several years for a new insolvency regime to really gain traction.  The ISI has, however, never worked towards the steady growth that international comparisons would suggest we aspire to.  Rather, since our establishment, we have done everything within our power to ensure that all those that could benefit from the statutory solutions available, in particular the PIA, do so.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year, the ISI undertook a critical appraisal of its work so far.  This culminated in the publication of a submission to the Department of Justice and Equality in June, a copy of which we have provided to all members of this committee.  Our analysis identified three key factors that influence activity levels.  They were the efficiency of the process, debtor engagement and creditor engagement.  In terms of the efficiency of the process, the core recommendation contained within our submission is that the insolvency arrangements provided for under the Act should be approved by the ISI rather than requiring a court to make an order for their approval.  Importantly, this recommendation has the support of all members of a consultative forum chaired by the ISI which is made up of debtor advocates, creditors, PIPs and the Courts Service.  The ISI is of the view that such a change would result in a number of benefits, including an increase in the accessibility to the personal insolvency system, savings in terms of the overall time taken to deal with a particular case, cost savings and consistency of approach.  In addition, the ISI recommends a number of other enhancements to the existing legislative framework to drive efficiencies, reduce barriers to entry and otherwise improve the overall process.  I would be happy to speak around any of these proposed changes should members of the committee wish me to do so.<br\/><br\/>Our submission also sets out steps we have undertaken to date to ensure debtors are aware of the solutions that are available to them.  These range from national and local campaigns on radio, television and print as well as free debtor advice clinics we have held around the country and attendance at similar events.  We also have a debtor-focused website called <i>backontrack.ie<\/i>and related materials.  Through the new Abhaile service, there are now free consultations available for debtors with PIPs as well as a number of other supports to ensure the insolvent debtor is supported at every stage of the process of addressing their unsustainable mortgage.  Once again, I would be happy to give the committee more details about what we have done to date in this area or to speak around our communications plans for the coming months should members of the committee wish me to do so.<br\/><br\/>In terms of creditor engagement, the ISI has consistently encouraged each main creditor to avail in a timely manner of the provision within sections 64 and 98 of the Act to make clear to PIPs the manner in which the creditor wishes the debts of a specific debtor to be dealt with as part of an arrangement and provide all PIPs with details of the range of options the creditor will broadly support within an insolvency proposal.  An example would be a so-called waterfall statement setting out their preferences as to when and how they would accept term extensions, adjustments to interest rates or the write-off of capital. This would be of assistance in helping the overall process run more efficiently.<br\/><br\/>It is disappointing to say that I am unaware of any significant progress on either of these fronts.  The simple reality is that the PIA is an extremely efficient solution for creditors as well as debtors.  There are several checks and balances contained in the legislation which is overseen by the courts to ensure that no party is unfairly prejudiced, but it does require the goodwill and support of both parties for the system to work efficiently and effectively.  Despite best efforts, I do not believe that creditors have constructively engaged with the personal insolvency legislation.  I can point to statements made by various banks as evidence of this.  I can point to dozens upon dozens of cases where banks have rejected proposals that produced a better return than repossession while also having due regard for the underlying security linked to any mortgage.  I can point to legal challenges mounted by creditors to various PIAs on technical rather than commercial grounds.  While it is perfectly within the rights of creditors to take such challenges, these challenges, where successful, amount to a pyrrhic victory.  The creditor still has a bad loan that they need to deal with.  They have turned down what should have been a sustainable solution that did not unfairly prejudice them for the case to have met the minimum statutory requirements set out in the Act.  Some creditors appear to be mounting objections which are designed to preserve their own credit guidelines, which have wide customer application, rather than dealing with the merits of individual cases which in many instances would provide a commercial return for the creditor which is far better than that which could be achieved through repossession or bankruptcy.<br\/><br\/>The committee should be aware of the section 115A review process introduced in late 2015 which was designed to remove the so-called bank veto whereby there is a requirement to attain certain levels of support from creditors before an arrangement can be put in place.  The legislation was designed to operate in a relatively quick manner whereby courts would be asked to review and assess the reasonableness of a rejected arrangement and, where satisfied and having regard to specific criteria set out in the Act that the arrangement was reasonable, the court would impose the arrangement over the will of the creditor.  These review cases have proven to be long and drawn out.  While I can point to a number of cases that have made significant strides forward, for example, with regard to warehousing and separated spouses, we still see large numbers of court reviews where the arguments before the court are technical legal points which inhibit consideration by the court of the commercial aspects of a proposal.<\/p><p>I see no evidence that creditors are using sections 64 or 98 of our Act, whereby they have an opportunity in the first instance to engage with practitioners and identify how they would wish their loans to be dealt with.  Instead, the practice appears to be to wait for the personal insolvency practitioner to produce a proposal, which is then challenged on as many fronts as possible.  Creditors must recognise what it is that this Act is designed to achieve - a fair outcome for all sides.  Such positive engagement could ensure that we keep as many people in their homes as possible, while also ensuring that the rights of creditors and secured lenders are respected to the greatest extent possible, and that creditors finally deal with their remaining non-performing loans.  In order to ensure positive engagement, the Act needs to be amended to oblige creditor engagement at that early stage in the process.<\/p><p> I now wish to turn to the main focus of today, which is the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017.  I should say at the outset that the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, welcomes any initiative designed to help deal with mortgage accounts that are in arrears.  The ISI notes the role envisaged for the service within the proposed Bill.  However, I should say that I am of the view that the Personal Insolvency Act incorporating our proposed amendments as set out in our submission this summer, coupled with the mandatory creditor engagement that I have just referred to, is the most appropriate way of achieving the objectives and the purpose behind the Bill.  Such an approach would, in my view, minimise the risk of legal challenge; minimise potential delays, expense and uncertainty that might be experienced from setting up a new office; and offer a holistic solution for debtors, returning a debtor to solvency by addressing all of their debts, not just the family home.<\/p><p> On the legal challenge, I am aware from D&aacute;il debates during the summer that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that the Government has a number of constitutional concerns regarding the Bill.  It is not for the ISI to comment on such constitutional issues.  However, I would point out that the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has operated for almost four years now without challenge.  The ISI set out in its summer submission why it believes its suggested proposal of removing the courts from the various processes, with regard to its existing arrangements, is sound from a constitutional perspective.<\/p><p> On minimising potential delays in setting up the office, the Bill does propose that a new office, the mortgage resolution office, be established within the ISI and that a new instrument, a mortgage resolution order, be introduced.  I would point out that there is a tendency among citizens to delay taking action until there is clarity around any new policy initiative.  Any initiative that causes insolvent debtors to delay engaging with their financial institution could have consequences in terms of increased arrears and increased risk of repossession.  For these reasons, I suggest that changes to the insolvency legislation that build on and enhance the current provisions will cause the least uncertainty for insolvent debtors.  It can also be delivered quickly.  Should the Bill become law, the ISI would be tasked with setting up the mortgage resolution office.  The committee has my commitment that we will leave no stone unturned in opening the service as quickly as possible, having regard to our duties and responsibilities under any establishing legislation.  However, it needs to be recognised that it will take time to set up an office of the type envisaged.<\/p><p> Understandably, the Bill is focused on mortgage arrears.  The Bill fails to address the other debts of the debtor, however.  Our existing Act takes a holistic approach, dealing with all the debts of a debtor, both secured and unsecured.  Our analysis shows that people with mortgage debts who seek help from the ISI have on average five other creditors.  Our experience in reviewing cases that have previously been dealt with on a bilateral basis between the debtor and their mortgage provider is that they often fall down due to the other debts that are owing.  It is essential that a holistic solution for debtors is provided that returns them to solvency as part of the process.  As a consequence of this, the family home is far more secure in the short term and longer term.<\/p><p> To conclude, my assessment is that creditors have yet to fully engage in a constructive manner with the Personal Insolvency Act.  This is notwithstanding the fact that it is carefully balanced to ensure the rights and obligations of all parties are protected and to ensure that no party is unfairly prejudiced.  I have already explained that creditors are not working within the spirit of the legislation.  Personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, are not getting clarity around the manner in which the creditor wishes for his or her debts to be dealt with, and this is despite numerous efforts on my part in every single engagement with banks.  While acknowledging that there is no legislative obligation on the creditor to provide this clarity, I am disappointed that the banks are not doing so voluntarily.  I believe, therefore, that it should become compulsory.  I also believe that some measures are needed to curtail the number of court review cases that are being contested on procedural rather than commercial grounds.  I believe that creditors should be restricted to only those arguments that they raise during the protective certificate period.  This would be fair to all sides and it would bring a much greater efficiency to the process.  I believe that these two creditor-focused changes, combined with the overall efficiency measures identified in our summer submission to the Department, would get us to the point we should have been at some years ago, whereby the Act, and the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, in particular, can be used to deal with all of the difficult mortgages and maximise the number of cases that see debtors remain in their homes.

Taking it in the context of how it would currently be dealt with within a personal insolvency arrangement, what the personal insolvency practitioner does when a debtor comes in his or her door and says  he or she has difficulty paying his or her debts is to try to maximise as much as possible to go towards the mortgage, because clearly the number one priority is to try to keep people in their homes.  If one tries to divert as much as possible of the income that a person has that way, then there is a better chance of him or her staying in his or her home.<\/p> <p>  The remaining debts tend to be unsecured such as credit cards, personal loans and so on.  In effect, there would be a token payment or a relatively small payment to unsecured creditors in that scenario.  One can see from the examples at the back of our submission that the kind of return those creditors could expect to receive within a PIA is a percentage return in single digits.  A return of 4%, 5%, or 6% is likely.  It is a relatively small amount, but they are then dealt with.  Any balance remaining is written off.  The debtor is left with only one debt, the mortgage, and therefore there is a much greater chance of finding a sustainable solution in that scenario.<\/p><p> In the cases appearing before us that others had previously attempted to fix, they had ignored the fact that, for example, the debtor had a credit union or credit card loan.  They only examined how much money the debtor had to pay off the mortgage.  They believed that it should work, but they forgot that, two or three months later, the credit union would be knocking on the door or the credit card company would be making a phone call.  It is difficult on that basis.<\/p><p> The typical PIA candidate whom we deal with is a married person who is in employment, in his or her 40s, has children and has an average debt of &euro;450,000 but, on average, has five debts in addition to a mortgage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017102500002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1174,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor stated that creditors were not working within the spirit of the legislation.

The practitioner is independent of the debtor and creditor and is there to find some common ground.  Currently, practitioners must do that in the dark because creditors are not telling practitioners what is likely to work for them and with what they are willing to live.  Instead, creditors sit back, wait for a proposal to be developed in the dark and then seek ways to challenge it.  The point I am trying to make is that it would be far better for all sides to sit down in week 1 of the three-month period, with the creditor examining the summary of the debtor's financial situation that has been presented and, understanding that the debtor wants to stay in the home, saying how far it can go and asking whether the other side can make that work.

It is clear creditors are behaving in a way that is utterly unacceptable and are clearly trying to frustrate the personal insolvency legislation.  That is simply not good enough.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland indicated creditors have not conformed to the spirit of the legislation, making it clear the letter of the legislation is not strong enough.  There is a responsibility on the Oireachtas to resolve that and ensure the legislation is strong enough.<\/p> <p>  Is a legislative change required to allow the Insolvency Service of Ireland to approve insolvency arrangements?  Is change required to give clarity on the manner with which a creditor wishes a debt to be dealt?  Is a legislative change required to ensure that only arguments raised during the protective certificate period can be raised in a court review?  Would such a restriction be difficult?

However, it is not a traditional appeal to the next court when a court finds in favour of A but B is not happy.  It is a court review of a creditor's decision to vote \"No\".  Accordingly, it is very much focused solely on what led up to that decision at the end of the protective certificate period.

The first category is where the personal insolvency arrangement can help.  Basically, if the debtor diverted all of the money they had towards the mortgage to service its current market value, then a deal could be done.  In other words, say one has a mortgage &euro;300,000 but the property is only worth &euro;100,000.  The personal insolvency arrangement can deal with any scenario where the debtor can service &euro;100,000 or more.  The bulk of borrowers can be helped in this way.<\/p> <p>  Then there are those who cannot service the current market value of their mortgage but only some element of it.  That is where mortgage-to-rent is the best solution to keep the roof over their heads.  They will lose the ownership of the property but in terms of the neighbours or the children staying in their school, they do not move and they are still in that property.<\/p> <p>  There is a third category, which is the smallest by far.  The persons in this category are, unfortunately, likely to lose their homes.  That is where in effect they have no means whatsoever by which they can service a private mortgage.

The Abhaile scheme, which has been operating for a year, is bringing debtors into the tent who are in a far more difficult place than they were in the past.  We were probably dealing with the low-hanging fruit in the early years.  Through the free consultation with practitioners, what one tends to see with the Abhaile cases is that they are either age-challenged, income-challenged or both.  That makes the solution that bit more difficult.  Even with those helped through Abhaile to date, we have saved the family home in 91% of cases.  It is by far and away likely that the majority will be able stay in their homes.  What we need to do is help those people.

I am pleased to be here this morning having been nominated by the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to serve as the chairperson of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  My professional background is in infrastructure finance.  I studied at University College Cork and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I worked for many years at the World Bank for the International Finance Corporation financing infrastructure in developing and transitioning economies.  Afterwards, I returned to Ireland and worked in infrastructure finance for KBC Bank at the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  In 2002, when the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, was established to take responsibility for Luas and other projects, I was appointed as its first chief executive.  During my ten years there, we launched Luas and extended it to the docklands, Cherrywood and Citywest, and we worked on other projects such as developing the leap card system.  Since leaving the RPA in 2012, I have continued to work mostly in infrastructure finance, advising a range of clients internationally and in Ireland.  I do much work in Asia, including in Vietnam and Indonesia, and in Jordan dealing with problems of urban congestion and particularly how mobilising the private sector to invest in and operate public transport can address infrastructure gaps there.<\/p><p>I have worked on projects in renewable energy and sustainability in Ireland.  I chair the board of Depaul Ireland, which is a homeless agency.<\/p><p> In 2013, the then Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, invited me to join the board of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I was very pleased to do that and it has been a great privilege to be on that very committed and dedicated board.  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, reappointed me to the board last year and I have been chair of the audit and risk group.  It has been a privilege to work with Mr. Phil Gaffney, who was an outstanding chairman and retired in July.  That brings me here.<\/p><p> Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plays a critical role in providing mobility in urban areas in Ireland and in offering an attractive alternative to private cars on intercity routes.  Passenger numbers in 2017 will reach approximately 45 million, which is a record level.  We are very pleased with that.  As the economy has recovered and there has been more congestion on major routes, we are pleased that people are availing of the option to use public transport.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provides a very safe and comfortable service which we are very pleased to be able to provide.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's safety record is exceptionally high by international standards and that is paramount in everything the company does.<\/p><p> I believe that, in the future, railways will play an even more critical role in mobility as we move to a low-carbon economy.  That is particularly the case for electrified transport in the greater Dublin area.  Apart from that, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann can get people out of cars and on to public transport in large numbers and it is the job of the board to ensure that we have the infrastructure, resources and skills to meet that growing need.<\/p><p> While I have that very positive message this morning, we are concerned about aspects of the infrastructure.  During the recession, maintenance was deferred because of a shortage of money.  That deferral of maintenance does not compromise safety but it results in temporary speed restrictions in some places and in the future we may struggle to provide the same quality of service to a growing number of passengers.  That is a major concern for us.  It would be bad news for us if we lost competitiveness in journey times, as well as being bad news for congestion and for how we, as a society, would meet our commitments on sustainability and climate change.  The scale of the problem with deferred maintenance has been recognised.  The National Transport Authority, with input from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, provided a rail review which was published last year.  That rail review indicated that, because of the deferred maintenance during the recession, we would really need to spend another increment of &euro;103 million per annum for five years to catch up with the deferred maintenance and make sure that we can continue to provide competitive journey times, that we restore the balance sheet of the company and are ready for future growth.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport recognises the issue and has committed to support us in doing that, subject to wider financial constraints.  It is a big challenge for us to make sure that we continue to do that, with continuing support from the Department, which has been very welcome and meaningful.  We need to recover the state of the assets to a level that can provide high quality transport.<\/p><p> The priorities Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should have over the next years are firstly to make sure that we continue to provide an excellent service for the 45 million current passengers.  Secondly, the railway infrastructure, an amazing resource, can be used to increase capacity.  It will require investment, but we can and need to get more people on existing railways.  We should plan for additional rail infrastructure in areas of high population density.  Unless we provide high capacity, high quality mass transit, we have no way to meet our sustainability objectives as a community.  All of that will require the continued commitment of management, the board, and the staff.  Those 3,800 people have shown tremendous dedication to maintaining this railway over a period of under-investment.  We need to make sure that we continue to provide an outstanding service for the travelling public.<\/p><p> I should refer to the industrial relations challenges facing Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's management recognises and acknowledges that there is an expectation for salary increases among the workforce and, in light of that, management put forward proposals to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, for salary increases in the context of management and organisational change that takes accounts of our straitened financial circumstances.  I hope that we can engage with workers and trade union representatives, the good offices of the WRC and the Labour Court, which we expect to have a role in this, to find a way to acknowledge and respond to workers' expectations for a salary increase after a certain period, since there has not been one, while recognising the financial circumstances of the company.  I think there is a way to do that and hope that we can get there and avoid unnecessary disruption to the travelling public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>It is an honour to be nominated for reappointment as chairman to the board of Dublin Bus by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and the members of the committee for the invitation to appear here today.<\/p> <p>  I am a native of Dublin and grew up in Artane where I attended Chanel College.  I joined C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann in 1979 as a bus conductor and qualified as a bus driver in 1985.  During my time in CIE I became a full time student in Trinity College Dublin and graduated in 1987 with a BA (Hons) in economics.  In my final year I studied transport and labour economics and in my undergraduate thesis, I examined how economically efficient Dublin Bus was against a backdrop of other bus operators.  In 1987 I left CIE and joined Ibec, starting my journey into a career in human resources and industrial relations.  Having held a number of different senior management positions throughout my career, I was group HR director in C&amp;C Group plc for seven years until 2008.  For the past ten years, I have been managing director of Courtney HR which provides management consultancy services to many leading Irish companies.  Throughout my career, I have received postgraduate diploma awards in judicial skills and decision making, corporate legal governance, employment law, arbitration, and also strategic management and executive coaching from Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.  I am a qualified mediator and arbitrator, master trainer and executive coach.  I am currently a member of the Public Service Pay Commission, Central Bank disputes resolution tribunal and a lay member of the client and complaints committee of the Law Society of Ireland.  I am a former board member of the Equality Authority and a current member of the Institute of Directors in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The vision for Dublin Bus is to provide a transport service where people feel safe, connected and  part of sustainable community life in Dublin.  Over the next three years, Dublin Bus will continue to operate in an environment where economic and social development will have a significant impact on the role of buses in public transport.  The priority is to meet that customer demand and provide services that the city needs.  The company&rsquo;s strategic imperatives are to ensure a safe, reliable and efficient service for our customers, to continue to exceed contract performance objectives, to continue the enhancement of our customers' experience, to increase urban bus usage in the Dublin area and to further strengthen the Dublin Bus brand and public transport.  It is evident that an efficient public transport system is key to delivering positive economic and social development in Dublin, and, in my recent tenure as Chairman, this has been a key objective that the company has continued to make significant strides to achieve.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, Dublin Bus signed a new public service obligation, PSO, contract for a period of five years.  The contract performance criteria are independently audited and Dublin Bus continues its strong record in exceeding its targets.  Since 2014, the organisation has been able to grow its business in a sustainable, efficient and customer-focused manner.  In 2017, Dublin Bus is on target to carry over 130 million customers, an increase of over 11 million in the past three years, while generating over &euro;300 million in revenue, an increase of &euro;24 million since 2014.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Bus has been successful in retaining its existing customers while attracting new customers to our service.<\/p><p>While Dublin commuters have a number of travel options available to them every day, at present 62% of all public transport trips into Dublin city centre are completed by bus.  Our aim is to continue to make the bus the most attractive option by providing a clean, modern fleet, services that provide value for money, and innovative developments in technology.  Dublin Bus services now include real-time passenger information and passenger displays at stops.  The on-board experience provides accessible vehicles with on-bus real-time passenger announcements and free Wi-Fi access.  The roll-out is taking place of USB charging points on our buses and both wheelchair user and buggy spaces for customers.  Our daily aim is punctuality and reliability.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus has publicly stated that its employees are the greatest company asset, providing an essential economic service to the city.  One of the company&rsquo;s highest priorities is to develop its employees and continue to provide opportunities to grow and develop within the workplace.  Dublin Bus is committed to equality and diversity and therefore ensures that all policies are developed to reflect the society in which it operates.  This is evident in all employee policies, particularly the recently launched gender transition policy which is both progressive and inclusive.  Recruitment has been a significant focus for the past few years, and many developments in recruitment policies have led to an increase in employment within the company, especially in respect of women.  Dublin Bus continued to show its commitment to equality with the graduation of its first ever all-women class of drivers in 2016.<\/p><p> Operating in a fully competitive environment, Dublin Bus is confident in its future and its capacity to grow.  While many challenges lie ahead, the company can be confident in its ability to tackle each one to ensure it remains an integral part of public transport provision in Dublin.  However, on the journey to that future, the bus provides a viable option to keep the city moving, its economy growing and it its citizens working.<\/p><p> Congestion remains a problem in Dublin, particularly in the morning and evening peak commuting times.  Many users are competing for the limited road space available, including private transport in the form of cars and motorcycles, public transport, cyclists, taxis, delivery vehicles and pedestrians.  As economic growth returns, congestion levels are increasing.  Congestion limits a city&rsquo;s ability to achieve its full potential in the economic, environmental, social and cultural areas.  Dublin is positioning itself as a modern European capital, and a congested city does not fit with this outlook.  Congestion is a key challenge for the economy and one which the bus can alleviate in the short term.<\/p><p> As chairman of Dublin Bus, I am pleased that the performance of the bus in delivering economic growth in Dublin has been recognised through the BusConnects proposals.  Seeking investment of &euro;1 billion in bus transport in Dublin, BusConnects recognises the strategic benefits for the country of investment in urban buses.  The company is fully engaged with this project and is committed to promoting and protecting the interests of our customers.  We want to ensure that all parts of Dublin city and the greater Dublin area enjoy a bus network that is reliable, efficient and accessible to all.  An excellent bus network is clearly of strategic importance to the city, and Dublin Bus has worked and will continue to work closely with all involved in this project to future-proof the city&rsquo;s bus network for the benefit of our customers and for a successful Dublin.<\/p><p> The Dublin Bus brand is our identifying mark for customers and a symbol of unity for our employees.  It is a major component of Dublin Bus and an iconic brand, widely recognised throughout the greater Dublin area, GDA, and further afield.  The brand is a notable part of the GDA and illustrates the unified mission of Dublin Bus of providing an effective public service with an enhanced customer experience that drives its purpose as a brand and an organisation.  The company&rsquo;s most recent independent tracker research illustrates that satisfaction with Dublin Bus as a brand is increasing continually among its customers.  The continued growth in customer satisfaction and journeys is testament to the quality of the brand.  The Dublin Bus brand unites employees internally under a common goal of serving our customers and underpins the company&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility activity and community initiatives.<\/p><p> Over the past three years, Dublin Bus has seen a continual and significant investment in the development of its fleet which ensures that it remains modern, reliable and environmentally friendly, and enables Dublin Bus to play a significant role in combating climate change.  A more modern fleet has led to a saving of 190,000 tonnes of CO2 and 76 million litres of fuel over three years.  The future fleet of Dublin Bus will move toward environmentally friendly engines.  Dublin Bus has a long history of trialling more efficient vehicles and will work with the National Transport Authority in assisting in the delivery of environmentally friendly vehicles.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus will be an integral part of an integrated transport network providing a safe, reliable, efficient and continuous service to the people of Dublin.  Through ongoing service development and investment, Dublin Bus will continue to provide reliable services, quality customer experience and innovative developments to our customers while also proving its status as leader within the field of public transport.  I look forward to making my contribution to the company by providing strategic support, supervision and guidance over the next three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Courtney.

I have served on the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann since April 2013 and it is my great privilege to have been appointed chairman since July 2014.  I am very pleased to have been nominated as chairman designate for another term.  During my tenure, Bus &Eacute;ireann has experienced profound challenges which have required major financial, cultural and structural reform, all of which are now being embraced throughout the organisation which this year celebrates 30 years of service to the cities, towns and villages throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Over the past year, the financial difficulties facing the company have been well documented and underpin our steadfast commitment to ensure the survival and future sustainability of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In 2016, our accounts showed that the overall financial deficit had increased to &euro;9.5 million from &euro;6 million in the previous year, and this trend triggered a comprehensive review of all aspects of the business.  The original focus was to deliver a sustainable plan for our Expressway commercial services which, as the committee members will know, do not receive any State subvention.  The combination of an increase in competition on the motorways with a high cost base brought about an unsustainable position which culminated in the directors appointing external advisers, Grant Thornton, to undertake a full appraisal of the robustness of management's business plan.  When the findings were presented to the board in December 2016, an urgent fresh review of the business was requested when it became evident that the challenges facing the company were not only confined to Expressway but, rather, were more far-reaching.<\/p> <p>  The review confirmed that prevailing work practices, structures, business processes and some routes at Bus &Eacute;ireann were simply not sustainable and required urgent intervention to ensure the future viability of the company as a whole.  A new management team was appointed by the board of directors to lead a new change plan, and communications with staff began in January of this year.  Unfortunately, when efforts at constructive engagement to address change failed, the matter was mediated through the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, which ultimately referred the matter to the Labour Court, which issued a recommendation.  This was accepted by a majority of staff by ballot in May of this year.  It is regrettable that a three-week strike took place during this process and I apologise again to our customers who were seriously discommoded during that period.<\/p> <p>  The Labour Court recommendation is the new cornerstone of our future and is currently being implemented.  It includes more than 60 work practice change initiatives and 240 staff reductions, which is equivalent to 10% of the current workforce.  Successful implementation of all the recommendations, which also include significant non-payroll cost savings, will deliver savings of approximately &euro;20 million to Bus &Eacute;ireann in a full financial year.  This will not only restore the solvency and viability of the company but, crucially, set the foundation to ensure the business is capable of competing in an increasingly competitive market not only to hold existing business but also to win new business in the future.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the board, I acknowledge the substantial commitment of our staff at this time to the survival plan which in itself has implications for many individuals throughout the organisation.  I encourage our management and staff to continue to work together to ensure that the Labour Court recommendation is fully implemented.  The hallmark of a successful implementation will be a business which is more efficient and more competitive.  These two qualities will, I believe, not only safeguard the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann but also open a gateway full of potential and possibilities.  There is a new dynamic within the company and we can build a viable company that will continue to offer a first-class service to our customers.  In the context of the advent of the bus market opening, the EU requirement for tendering of routes and continued competitive pressure on inter-regional corridors, it behoves us to deliver a plan which ensures the company is better positioned to compete effectively in this new era.<\/p><p>While we continue to expand our network and offer greater frequency and connectivity on our services to improve our product, we need steady State investment to underpin our growth ambitions, and in this regard I am pleased to advise the committee that we are positively engaging with our stakeholders on essential investment in our fleet, reasonable profit on our public service obligation, PSO, services, together with addressing the current underfunding of the free transport scheme, particularly on our Expressway services.  I believe these commitments will be clarified over the coming weeks.<\/p><p> For my part, I want Bus &Eacute;ireann to be recognised as progressive and to succeed by providing an excellent service to the public.  We are the only national operator in Ireland with in excess of 250 routes and more than 50 years of experience in delivering a school transport scheme which is unparalleled in its scale throughout Europe.  I assure the committee that the board will ensure that in our quest for cost savings, our position on safety will never compromised.  In this regard, I am pleased that our swift decision to suspend all services in the best of interests of all of our customers and staff was recognised recently when Hurricane Ophelia visited our shores.<\/p><p> The future of public transport in Ireland is changing and Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to being part of that change.  The establishment of the National Transport Authority, NTA, has changed the dynamic and many of the functions previously undertaken by the company are now the responsibility of the NTA.  For our part, we recognise the fundamental change required by the company to become a high-quality service provider which can compete in the market and offer an unrivalled service to customers and provide real value for money to the State.<\/p><p> There is some ill-informed comment about the subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  To be clear, we operate Expressway on a purely commercial basis with no subvention from the State.  We operate city and stage carriage services under a PSO payment because they are not viable commercial services but the State judges them to be in the public interest.  We also operate school transport services for the Department of Education and Skills.  In this regard, we are no different from bus companies in the UK and Europe, except that we are owned by the State.  However, our commitment is to provide value for money to the State and, as I said earlier, we now have the mechanism to achieve our objectives.<\/p><p> The board and management remain committed to delivering the best transport system possible in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  Our commitment to delivering on the requirements of our stakeholders, such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Education and Skills, which we recognise are intensely customer-centric and efficiency-focused, has never been stronger.  I look forward to working with the Minister, the Department, the NTA, CIE and the Bus &Eacute;ireann board and management team in growing public transport in a sustainable, safe and efficient manner and to putting in place an investment framework matched to a new cost structure that can and will secure the long-term viability of Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his opening statement.

I come from Boyle in County Roscommon.  When in Dublin I use public transport to get to work.  Public transport has evolved down through the years.  I admire the manner in which the company has embraced modern technology in terms of the introduction of the Leap card and Google maps application for public transport, which I use when I visit the cities.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Allen of Irish Rail.  The journey time from Sligo to Dublin, which is 179 kilometres, is three hours.  The journey time from Cork to Dublin, which is 267 kilometres, is two and a half hours and from Galway to Dublin, which is 209 kilometres, is two hours and ten minutes.  I do not understand why it takes longer to get from Sligo to Dublin than it does to get from Cork or Galway to Dublin given Cork and Galway are further away from Dublin.  I live in Boyle in Roscommon and my partner lives in Castlerea, which is further west, yet the train journey from there to Dublin is quicker.  This issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In regard to parking charges at train stations, while there is paid parking available at Boyle station, there are virtually no paid parking facilities anywhere else on that route.  Paid parking should be available in towns with a population of more than 10,000.  Recently, people travelling by train from Roscommon to a football match were unable to prepay for parking because of a problem with the prepay text service such that when they returned, their cars were clamped.  Irish Rail did address the issue.  I appreciate that the company has to make money but the policy of parking charges at small stations should be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  There is much talk about one Ireland.  I previously chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  A high-speed link between Dublin and Belfast would be of huge significance.  There is already a high-speed link between Dublin and Cork, although it needs to be quicker.  Are there any plans for a high-speed link between Dublin and Belfast?  I would welcome Mr. Allen's views on that issue and on the Sligo service.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Murphy.  What did he mean by his statement that commitments in regard to the free transport scheme should be clarified over the coming weeks?  Bus &Eacute;ireann is competing with private operators.  Three or four years ago an issue arose in regard to the Bus &Eacute;ireann service on the Sligo to Dublin route which, as a politician, I tried to resolve.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was operating six services each way per day on that route and we sought to have three of those services serve Roosky and Dromod.  It was a difficult issue to try to resolve.  Mr. Murphy said that the Expressway service operates on a purely commercial basis.  Is there any way around that?  As a politician, I will never again get involved in this issue because I felt it was used as a political football.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was not able to clarify the situation at that time.

The Sligo line is a critically important line on which passenger numbers are good.  I agree with the Senator that unless we provide competitive journey times, people will return to using their cars.  I was not aware that the journey time from Sligo to Dublin is three hours.  In regard to journey times, in almost all cases the issue is one of fixed infrastructure.  The work we are doing in terms of the rail review involves ensuring the maintenance and upgrade of fixed infrastructure, including cleaning the ballasts and removing any temporary speed restrictions in place and, closer to the cities, ensuring that the regulation of journeys is such that they are not conflicting with one another.  I do not know why the Sligo-Dublin journey takes three hours but I agree that three hours is a long time.  For it to be competitive with private transport, I would need to examine what changes could be made to the fixed infrastructure to ensure provision of a more competitive journey time.  I do not disagree with the point made by the Senator.<\/p><p>I do not have an answer to it here and now, but we will look into the matter and get back to the Senator about it to see what can be done.<\/p><p> Parking charges at railway stations are an annoyance for some people, and I apologise that an issue arose with clamping and if there was a problem with the texting system.  However, in our financial circumstances, small though the payment is to park a car at a railway station, we need to try to maintain whatever sources of income we can as long as that charging remains fair.  When I see sometimes what I pay for commercial parking in many other places, I believe the charges at railway stations are quite moderate and also discourage people from leaving their cars there over extended periods.  If the Senator is asking me whether we could come up with a policy not to charge at small railway stations, it would be difficult, even though the loss would not be enormous.  It would be difficult to defend not charging at some stations while charging at others, so-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1222,"content":"<p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann already does that.

It can be an annoyance, and we should do whatever is possible to get people out of the car and into the train for the journey to Dublin rather than putting in place obstacles to that.  I did not know that at some stations on that line there are parking charges while at others there are none.<\/p> <p>  Regarding shortening the journey time from Dublin to Belfast, I do not think we will ever have a high-speed link between the two cities, but we do need to shorten the journey time, and a number of measures are being taken in this regard.  I return to the point of ensuring that any delayed maintenance of the fixed infrastructure is recovered.  Furthermore, coming closer to Dublin, because the northern line and the DART service share a track, we need to improve the regulation of those services and move to a ten-minute frequency on the DART, which would be in the best interests of the passengers.  They would not have to know what the schedule is.  They would just know that the DART comes every ten minutes.  Doing this, particularly in the off-peak period, will allow much better regulation of trains coming in from Belfast.  Frequently, when I am on that line - I do use it - the delays are often in the last section of the journey, as one comes into Dublin, rather than further north.  I do not think the issue arises as much further north.  We have plans in this regard and we hope to move ahead with them in 2018.  They are part of the discussions at present with trade union representatives to move to that ten-minute frequency.  If we move to a ten-minute frequency, ensure better regulation close to the city, reduce delays there and then recover any delayed maintenance on the line overall, journey times will be shortened.  This is a priority for us because our passenger numbers on that line are very good and are growing and we want to continue to provide an excellent service on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>Regarding the free transport scheme, the difficulty is that the funding that came from the Department did not cover the number of passengers carried on Expressway in particular.  There have been extensive discussions recently in this regard, and the budgets are being clarified.  The clarification arising from these discussions of the budget amount that will come to Bus &Eacute;ireann for free travel in 2018 will, I hope, be a significant improvement on the previous situation.<\/p> <p>  I am not quite clear on the point the Senator made about Expressway.  Our Expressway service is purely commercial and no subvention from the State is involved either in day-to-day running or capital investment.  With significant competition on all the routes we service, we must try to manage that competition as best we can while continuing to service the intermediate towns as best as possible.  There is a dilemma there because passengers at the end of the line want almost a non-stop service.  If someone gets on at Galway, for example, he or she will want a non-stop service to Dublin and will get frustrated if it calls at Athlone or Mullingar on the way.  However, the reality is that we must service customers in those towns as well, so there is an issue there that is very difficult to manage.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the Senator's third point about the NTA, we have worked very closely with the NTA where new licences have been granted to us for the bypassing of certain towns because of the number of passengers using the service.  The NTA then infills with Local Link and so on in order that there is a match-up between bringing passengers locally to a point at which we can then pick them up on our Expressway service.  A little more work probably needs to be done on this, and the NTA itself would recognise that, but I think it has substantially improved.  Certainly, on any occasion where we are bypassing a town, we have substantial negotiation and discussion with the NTA on the matter.  In general, we have forged a good relationship with the NTA in dealing with all the issues around ensuring seamless transport for Ireland.  Its brief is to provide that interlinked transport using different service providers.  This is the point I was making in my address.  In the past, Bus &Eacute;ireann was charged with responsibility for providing public transport as a mission.  That is now the remit of the National Transport Authority.  We are now a service provider and we will work to provide that level of best-quality service in conjunction with the plans that the NTA has to serve the country as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I do not think there were any questions to Dublin Bus in Senator Feighan's contribution, so I call Deputy Troy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#K00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I welcome our three guests.

All the witnesses come to their respective positions with different qualifications and experience, some more so than others in so far as transport is concerned, and each is chair of the body he represents in very turbulent times, both currently and in the past.  I read an article written by a current Minister at a time when he was not a Minister.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>On December 5, Minister Brendan Howlin announced that he was cutting the state subsidy to CIE ...<br \/><br \/>Not a bad idea as CIE has in recent years been exposed as a swamp of waste and skulduggery.<br \/><br \/>Quangos like CIE and its three subsidiaries - Dublin Bus, Bus Eireann and Iarnrod Eireann - are in dire need of efficiencies.

Has that &quot;plenty of fat hidden in the darker corners of these ... bodies&quot; been identified and eradicated, and are the witnesses sure that each of their bodies is operating to the greatest efficiencies possible?  In that context, are there any vacancies on any of their respective boards?  Do they feel there are particular competencies which may be missing from their respective boards?<\/p><p>Regarding Dublin Bus, correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that while Mr. Courtney has vast experience in different areas, his experience in the transport sector is quite limited.  How long has he been a board member of Dublin Bus?  He might come back to me with a response to that.  Specifically, when did he take up the position of chairperson?  Last year we identified the fact that despite a significant increase in revenues in Dublin Bus, there was a decrease in profit.  Why is that?<\/p><p>Mr. Murphy has been chairperson of Bus &Eacute;ireann for a number of years and was recently reappointed.  Last year was a particularly turbulent one for Bus &Eacute;ireann, and the people who suffered the most were the passengers who rely on Bus &Eacute;ireann to go about their daily work or to college or whatever else.<\/p><p>A report was presented in 2015 which clearly outlined the serious issues facing Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Did the chief executive officer, CEO, at that time make that report available to Mr. Murphy and his board?  Did they discuss that report and what actions did they take as a consequence of having been made aware of it?   It was the total and utter inaction by the board and the executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann for a protracted period - effectively, they buried their heads in the sand - that led to the industrial action and the three weeks of widespread chaos in Bus &Eacute;ireann last year.  I would welcome Mr. Murphy's opinion on that.<\/p><p> Regarding Irish Rail, Mr. Allen said the job of the board is to make sure that Irish Rail is adequately resourced.  He also went on to say that because of the lack of resources afforded to Irish Rail, it now needs &euro;103 million per annum for the next five years.  How does he intend to fund that?  He said that Irish Rail is in danger of losing competitiveness but I would say it has lost it.  My colleague cited the example of the Sligo line, which serves my home town of Mullingar.  It is quicker for me to drive to Leinster House in the morning than to take the train, despite the current major traffic disruption and congestion.  If Mr. Allen is serious about Irish Rail being a competitive choice for passengers, we need to see large-scale investment in the rail network to ensure the tracks are fit for purpose, that reduced speed limits do not have to be introduced and that carriages are brought up to standard and fit for purpose.  If the speed of the rail services is not increased, we will not be able to attract people to use those services.  The reason I drive to Leinster House is that I have free parking.  The reason most people take the train is not related to the speed of getting into Dublin but due to the high cost of parking in the city.<\/p><p> Mr. Allen touched on the strike.  I am glad he did so at the end of his contribution as I was worried he might not do so.  Is it true that the CEO intervened at a crucial stage in a negative way which derailed the talks, as a consequence of which we are again going to have industrial action and the people who will suffer will be travelling public who rely on these services day in, day out?<\/p><p> I got correspondence, as I am sure did my colleagues, from an anonymous source - I want to put that on the record and Mr. Allen can treat it being anonymous however he wants - to the effect that a company, which had to defer maintenance of its tracks because of limited resources, spent tens of thousands of euro sponsoring a fishing trip to the North of Ireland for senior members of the executive in Irish Rail.  Is Mr. Allen aware of that?  Does he believe that is an appropriate use of limited resources?  He might comment on that.<\/p><p> Does each of the three bodies represented here continue to make payments to IBEC on an annual basis?

I have no concern whatsoever.  Any organisation in the public sector or the private sector here in Ireland or internationally needs to continue to find ways to achieve better value for money.  In terms of much of the dialogue currently taking place about redeploying resources, getting more staff on trains rather than in offices and a range of issues like that, every organisation needs to commit to that sort of transformation, not to deal with skullduggery or waste but to make sure that we provide excellent value for money and a high-quality service.  That is the focus.  There absolutely is a need for changes and the management has committed to implementing those, and that will provide a better service and save money.  There is no issue about skullduggery or waste - absolutely not.<\/p> <p>  Moving on, there is one vacancy on the board at present.  That is going through a certain process with the public appointments system and I presume it will be filled some time soon.  A number of vacancies were filled in recent months, including by people with very good experience in human resources, HR, which is very useful on the board, and an accountant was appointed last week.  The board is almost at its full complement and the range of skills around the table is a very good one.  If someone were to ask me today what I would look for if an another vacancy were to arise, I would perhaps look having more consumer marketing skills or something like that.  There is a range of skills on the board with which I am very happy and I expect the one vacancy on it to be filled quite soon.  <\/p> <p>  Moving on to the Deputy's question about ensuring our infrastructure is adequately maintained and investment is made in it, we all know we have come through a period in Ireland where we did not have the money to invest large amounts of money in infrastructure.  We are now catching up with that.  We are talking about rolling stock and fixed infrastructure.  In Ireland, as in every other part of the world, that infrastructure needs to be paid for from the public sector.  Following the rail review I mentioned that was carried out by the National Transport Authority, there is active engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to make sure that now there is a bit more money available, some of it will be allocated to recover some of the infrastructure issues that have led, as Deputy Troy said, to a longer journey time than is necessary.

I can go so far as to say we have been informed.  I am confident, however; that is the best way to put it.  If there were a problem, I would take the opportunity now to say the matter was not being taken seriously, but I am not saying that in any way.  I am confident it is being dealt with very seriously.<\/p> <p>  On the point on the competitiveness of the journey time, such competitiveness is a critical aspect of getting people out of cars and onto public transport.  It is not the only aspect but we need to work on that.  There is the overall package, including pricing and everything else that goes with it.  With regard to competing to get people out of cars and onto bus, rail and other public transport options, if people have free parking at their origin and destination, it is almost impossible for public transport to compete.  That is the reality.  I do not believe we should be embarrassed that we are getting people on public transport just because they have to pay large amounts for parking at their destinations.  We are providing a high-quality service.  The consistency of the journey time is very important, as are reliability and the investment that needs to be made.  The investment is being made and will continue to be made to make journey times more consistent and tight.  We are absolutely committed to that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to industrial relations issues and the newspaper report that the chief executive had intervened in a negative way.  Were the chief executive not actively supporting and participating in critical negotiations and discussions, as well as making sure every possible avenue was being explored, I am not sure what he would be doing.  I would want the chief executive to be giving support actively and making sure that if proposals are put on the table, they are costed in order that one can see what is going to be done.  Those who regard the idea of the chief executive having an input as negative in some way should realise that is what he is paid to do.  I have no concern.  When I saw the newspaper report stating the chief executive had been involved, I said that is what the chief executive is paid to do.  I do not accept, therefore, that a strike is proposed because the chief executive intervened negatively.  That is not the case.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the anonymous letter to which Deputy Troy referred, I got one in the post in recent days.  I presume it is the same anonymous one about the sponsorship of an angling event.  I did not know that this event was going to take place.  A fair question would be whether, if I had known the company was providing sponsorship for this event, I would have believed it would be a good idea.  That might be a fair way of expressing it.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's participation in professional networks, whereby our rail staff engage with, get to know and learn from the experiences of staff in railways across Europe, is a good thing.  Sometimes that involves more informal social activities.  I believe approximately &euro;20,000 was Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s contribution to the sponsorship of this event.  It goes to various countries around Europe.  I do not know how often it comes to Ireland.  It was a very long time ago.  On the question whether I believe building networks through which Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff can learn from experience elsewhere, I do not have a difficulty with that.

The use of public funds is extremely important to Dublin Bus.  Like the committee, we are watching this very closely.  The function of a board is to make sure there is no waste of public funds in regard to any moneys given to the company.  We have a very tight view on that.  If anybody, at any time, brought it to my attention or that of the board that there was any waste or a belief that there was a waste of money, we would investigate it, be it in respect of corporate entertainment or anything else.  The funds are hard to get but when we get them we try to mind them as best we can.  In my tenure, I have had no knowledge of anything untoward in that regard.  We would certainly investigate immediately.  Ours is not the kind of company whose officials go away on corporate junkets.  We do not do that; we try to run a very tight, clean ship because management must answer to the board and the board must answer to the D&aacute;il.  That is the way it is and the way it should be.<\/p> <p>  With regard to vacancies on the board, there is one vacancy currently.  We would like to have it filled.  We have a broad range of skills.  We have a very good and very balanced board.  The system that was introduced recently has worked very well for us and we are looking for another person.<\/p><p>We have also introduced a board succession plan to allow us to identify the needs for future boards and when we can fill them.  It will allow us to make a universal case to the Department and the Minister on when those positions should be filled and what skills are needed.<\/p><p> I have been chairman of Dublin Bus for the past three years.  I am here looking for renomination.  I do not know what more questions the committee wants me to answer about experience or qualifications in that regard.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus is a good company and is generating much revenue.  However, we have the age-old problem with funding which we have to take to the Government and the Department.  We try to make the company as efficient as possible and make it as hard as possible for the D&aacute;il not to give us funds to run a service.  We are in a growing economy.  It is important public transport is seen as a strategic part of the State's infrastructure and is funded on that basis.<\/p><p> One can talk about one year and when it is up or down relative to other years.  However, as Mr. Frank Allen said, one really needs to talk about multi-annual funding.  When we do a contract with the State on public service obligations, it should be over five years.  We would then have a good idea where we stand, rather than doing it every year.  Over the past six months, we have been discussing funding with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Anybody who has run a business will understand how difficult that is.  We understand these are the rules but we will always make the argument that multi-annual contracts would make a difference to us, as well as to the State.  It would force us to tell the committee what our costs and expenses will be which we can then be held to.<\/p><p> The economy will change and will continue to do so.  The challenge for us will be to ensure we can beat congestion and meet demand.  The demand is there and people want bus services.  We want to be ahead of the curve, not behind it.  We will work extremely hard to stay ahead of the curve.<\/p><p> We will hold on to 30 buses this year to put them out on top of the existing buses the NTA will give to us.  In that regard, we work closely with the NTA.  We might not always agree but we work closely to ensure this service works.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus is a member of Ibec.  We reviewed it this year and will review it next year.  We review any payment we make to any group to make sure it gives us the service we need.  Every last cent has to be accounted for and it has to be value for money for us as a service.  The principle point about Ibec is that we get a range of services.  We are employers and Ibec is an employer representative organisation.  It has a national executive committee of which our managing director is a member.  It also has transport committees and is a body of influence and information.  We use it as a service.  As soon as the service is not appropriate or relevant to us, we will not use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>I made the point several times in my presentation that the Bus &Eacute;ireann board is conscious of value for money to the State and is careful of any expenditure.

We can certainly provide the committee with details of that.<\/p> <p>  There is currently one board vacancy.  Again, we have a good mix and will certainly have that vacancy filled soon.  I have no concerns about the make-up of the board's skill sets in order to manage the company effectively.<\/p> <p>  With regard to 2015, the genesis of what happened was that the board in 2015 was increasingly concerned about trends in the company's financial position.  As a consequence of that, approaching the latter half of 2015, the board asked the chief executive to come to it with proposals because of its concerns where the company might be from a financial perspective.  In the latter part of 2015, the board threatened not to pass a budget for 2016, believing it would not be tenable.  Reluctantly, on the final analysis, we passed a budget on the basis that by June 2016, the situation would have been resolved.  The management, through its chief executive, presented a plan along those lines.<\/p> <p>  It was becoming clear to the board in 2016, however, that the plan was not being adhered to and it was seriously concerned about that.  Despite promises to the effect of changes taking place, they did not happen.  That is the genesis of the point I made.  In the latter part of 2016, we appointed external advisers to advise us on the business plans that the chief executive and management team had presented.  That is the basis on which that happened.<\/p> <p>  I reject totally that it was the board which was negligent in that regard.  I would make the point that the board was conscious of the company's financial position.  At all times, it monitored performance to ensure the company was sustainable.  That is the basis on which the viability plan in the early part of this year was discussed with our employees.  It is regrettable that a three-week strike took place.  It was an unnecessary strike in my view.  The outcome of the discussions that took place with the trade union representatives could have been achieved without a strike.  Unfortunately, the environment was such that the strike took place and there was little we could do about that.  At that point in time, if we had continued as we were, we would have been accused of reckless trading.

That was the initial stage.  There was no 24 months of time lost.  I reject that contention.<\/p> <p>  With regard to waste, what came out of the investigation into the Bus &Eacute;ireann position was that there were work practice inefficiencies.  Even in different regions, there were different work practices.  Those work practices had to be negotiated with staff.  We cannot take unilateral action.  If one takes unilateral action, one gets into industrial disputes.  Addressing the inefficiencies and introducing improvements and modernisation must be negotiated with staff representatives.  That takes time and agreement.<\/p> <p>  From Bus &Eacute;ireann's point of view, we did not take unilateral action until the final stage in 2017 when, despite the best efforts of the new management team, no agreement was forthcoming from the employee representatives.  The board quite clearly said it was not prepared to continue in that situation because, under the Companies Act, it would be liable to prosecution.  For that reason, the board said, unilaterally, certain things needed to happen.  Unfortunately, that kind of environment created industrial action and it was necessary to deal with that.

Can the company stand behind that policy?  On some trains that led to overcrowding and anti-social behaviour on carriages.  There are also people freeloading, taking advantage of not being checked on the routes.  Is that policy being reviewed?<\/p> <p>  On a larger scale, following the break-up of CIE, Irish Rail divided itself into two operations, infrastructure management and railway undertaking.  Has this been of benefit to the company?  How many people are employed at executive level in each company?  Was it necessary to create two tiers of executives again?  Does having these two separate operations provide value for money?  There is a feeling at the lower levels that this is not delivering what it was intended to deliver.  We could do with more drivers.  When does Mr. Allen expect the rail review to be published? <\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has come through a tumultuous and traumatic time with regard to the strike.  I am glad to see that has been resolved.  I am not sure whether all are in agreement with the cuts that have been implemented but I hear that management is working on it.  One of the big issues was the Expressway routes.  I have to reiterate that there is unfair competition when the National Transport Authority, NTA and the Department talk about a Cork to Dublin route for the private operator.  Such an operator can fill his bus in Cork city and go straight to Dublin whereas the Expressway has to, and will I hope continue to, stop off at some of the major towns between Cork and Dublin.  That adds to the cost and maybe the time but it is an invaluable service.  The concern is that it gets no aid or funding for it even though it is obliged to accept the free travel pass, whereas the private operators are not.  That creates unfair competition putting Expressway in jeopardy.  Will there be any talks to resolve that discrepancy?  Knowing the public transport service, I know there will always be strikes and this will become a thorn in our sides again.  What is being done to resolve a problem of competition in future?<\/p> <p>  With pride in delivering a bus service Mr. Murphy mentioned the school bus runs but every year there are areas where those runs are reformulated at the direction of the Department of Education and Skills and in this case the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  Nothing has been done about that.  Families are in turmoil and have to send their children to different schools because they did not make the first roll for the ticketing system.  Does the Department speak to people on the ground?  There is no point implementing policy without being practical.  Is there any co-ordination between Bus &Eacute;ireann officials on the ground and the Department?  In east Cork historically there was a parish catchment area where pupils went to Fermoy.  Now, because of changes in the Department's rules parents are told to send the children over the border to County Waterford.  If Mr. Murphy knew anything about the GAA he would know that it is not done to send people from one county to be educated in another county.  I am referring to the historic connection.  No thought went into these changes.<\/p> <p>  I will let my colleagues deal with Dublin Bus.  My final question is on climate change and related issues.  This may be one for Irish Rail.<\/p><p>I remember not so many years ago that when the port of Cork was relocating, its original proposal was refused by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One of the reasons was the lack of a proper rail service.  I thought it was extraordinary.  Regarding getting many HGVs on the rail tracks, that is fine if one is travelling from the top of Sweden down to Spain where there is very little roll-on, roll-off activity.  This country is a small nation.  Where is Irish Rail with regard to the movement of heavy goods?

It is an objective of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to have more on-board staff.  In fact, that is part of the discussions taking place with trade unions in terms of change management in the organisation although with a different focus.  Rather than checking the tickets, the aim would be to provide a service to the customer.  It will address some of the points the Deputy made about anti-social behaviour.  It is not a serious issue but having somebody on a train who is a presence and can respond to queries makes sense.  I support it and the management want to do it.<\/p> <p>  Greater use of electronic ticketing is a good thing and I am supportive of it.  The Deputy is right in identifying that the removal of ticket checkers without having a presence on the train leads to us missing out on something.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann wants to have a better presence on trains but it wants to do it through providing a better service rather than checking tickets.  There are rigorous processes in place to check for fare evasion because for the decent fare-paying passenger, it is entirely unfair to have to sit next to somebody who is cheating.  The resources that have been committed to rigorous revenue protection have increased over time.  This will continue to be the case because it is only fair on the person who has paid for his or her ticket that the person next to him or her who should have paid does so and if he or she has not paid, he or she is caught.  There will be changes in terms of on-board staffing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy described us as having divided ourselves into infrastructure management and railway undertaking.  Be assured that it was not the intention of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to do that.  There are EU rules about separating the infrastructure manager from the railway operator and those rules make perfect sense in continental countries where there could be a German railway going into France and where separating them out made perfect sense.  Those rules apply to all member countries.  The initiative Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann took in terms of that separation of management responsibility was the absolute minimum required to meet the letter of the requirements from the EU.  It did not really result in any duplication of senior management.  In fact, there has been an effort at some shared services so that they would be provided to the infrastructure management side and the railway undertaking side.  The Deputy asked whether that change resulted in value for money.  The intention of it was part of the EU Single Market.  It was done for reasons of compliance rather than value for money but every effort was made to make sure it avoided any wasteful duplication.  I do not see anybody coming to board meetings where one person says one thing and another person says the same thing from the other company.  I do not think it has done that.

It was not really the case.  I am not saying separating the company into these two divisions was a great idea but it was something we were obliged to do.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the publication of the rail review.  That is on the website of the NTA.  There has been good engagement on the part of the public, public representatives and others in that regard.  That rail review is available.  On the question of how it is to be implemented, it sets out clearly what is required and how it can be done within the available resources.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's last point regarding freight, I feel there are greater opportunities even in a small country to get more heavy goods onto rail.  Even last week, we challenged management to say that in a growing economy with growing congestion on motorways, we should be identifying other customers with heavy goods so that we can get them on to trains close to Dublin Port or Rosslare.  There must be opportunities.  Rail freight is in decline across Europe, which is shocking considering our climate change obligations and so forth, but that is the case.  Renewable energy is moving to biomass, and biomass is a perfect example of a commodity from forest products that could be used.  We could find opportunities within biomass energy generation plans.  I am responding positively to the Deputy's question.  We will see whether we can get any more customers on to trains rather than have them clogging up motorways and roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>I am pleased to confirm that the Labour Court recommendation is being implemented.

There has been very good engagement between management and employee representatives in implementing that change so I am pleased to report that to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  I take the point made by the Deputy regarding Expressway routes.  It was one of the issues that caused great difficulty for the commerciality of Expressway in that we were committed to providing passage for people on free travel despite the fact that our competitors do not do that, and we will continue to do that.<\/p><p>However, we were not getting the funding from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to compensate for that.  Based on discussions this year, we have made substantial progress in improving that position.  The figures will be confirmed in coming weeks.  There will be a substantial improvement which we believe will go a considerable way towards helping us to make Expressway a much more competitive and sustainable operation.  We are committed to ensuring the Expressway routes provide connectivity into the major provincial towns.  Some passengers want to get on a bus in Cork and go all the way to Dublin without stopping in between, but the provincial towns such as Clare and Thurles along the way also need to be serviced.  We are committed to providing those services in the best way possible.  It is dependent on the patronage of passengers in those towns.  In some of the areas where we have indicated the routes are under threat, sometimes there is demand to improve the number of passengers using the service but sometimes there is not and in those environments we must take the decision to discontinue a service in order to make Expressway competitive.  <\/p><p> On school buses, we operate purely as a service provider.  The Department has its policy guidelines on the number of students we pick up, the routes, the number servicing particular schools and so on.  There is good communication, where we feed information from our guys on the ground through to the Department on which it can base its decisions.  I do not have the level of detail to comment on individual areas but I take the general point that the Deputy is making and will convey it to the chief executive so that we are communicating as fully as possible with the Department on any local issues that might arise. It is important to preserve the sense of identity in a county or region because that kind of thing has an impact on people in those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>We will suspend for ten minutes and then take the rest of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#Q00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508918400,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.32 a.m. and resumed at 11.47 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Imelda Munster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#R00100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1279,"content":"<p>I will begin with questions for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I noted that Mr. Allen's opening statement made no reference to the budget.  Given the dire financial circumstances in which Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann finds itself, he did not refer to there being no specific additional capital investment announcement in the budget.  The additional public service obligation contribution was 8%, which is a paltry amount in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann applied any pressure on the Minister in any way?  Mr. Allen said that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is confident that funding will come.  His statement to the committee referred to the rail review but the one thing it flagged was that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was in dire financial circumstances to the point where serious safety issues had been raised and it would require &euro;500 million over the next five years.  We have just had the budget and the Minister has made no reference to that whatsoever and has given no clear indication regarding additional capital allocation or otherwise.  The additional funding for the public service obligation is minimal when one considers the extra work for which it must pay.  Mr. Allen seems comfortable that there may or may not be something coming down the road.<\/p><p>It is as if the seriousness of the financial position has not sunk in.  What representation has been made to the Minister?  How many meetings did the witness have before the budget with the Minister to argue the case for funding?  Why has the Minister thus far ignored that call?<br\/><br\/>The possible industrial action coming down the road is exactly the same as what happened with the Bus &Eacute;ireann workers.  In Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann there has been a decade or more of gross underfunding.  The company refers to it as deferred maintenance but it is a lack of funding in infrastructure that would keep a safe standard.  The company again seems to be ignoring the fact that funding has issued and the same scapegoat seems to be targeted.  It is the workforce and the change in management.  Is the witness of the opinion that workers, ten years on and having taken pay cuts over that period, are entitled to the pay rises they seek?  Do they have a right to ask for that, regardless of the lack of funding and investment over decades?  That is not the fault of workers.  The same as the witnesses or any of us, they are entitled to a pay rise.  Does the witness accept that?  The passenger numbers have increased so much that the company is back to 2007 levels.  Passengers are coming back.  As with Bus &Eacute;ireann, the people singled out for changes and to bear the brunt are workers.<br\/><br\/>I have a question on rail operations and profits.  Do operational profits go to infrastructure or where are they spent?  Will the witnesses give some detail as I am sure they are aware of exactly where they go?  There are a couple of other matters, including the safety concerns in the rail review and the lack of funding.  It goes everywhere from signalling to the possibility of line closures and speed restrictions.  There was an incident in Cork involving signalling problems and the station was closed for a number of weeks.  There is overcrowding on carriages and problems with disability access.  None of these has been addressed.  I am at a loss as to what has been done by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann other than making reference to it in the statement.<br\/><br\/>What is the opinion of the witness on the fact that the Minister, thus far, has given no real commitment?  He certainly made no announcement in the budgetary measures.  If the witnesses know of the commitment, what exactly is it?  Will the company be happy if it gets funding for an extra couple of dozen carriages?  The rail review clearly states that &euro;500 million over the next five years is needed, but will the company settle for less?<br\/><br\/>Is the company is involved with public-private partnerships etc?  If investment was made in the rail network, particularly carriages etc, would it be to prepare it for privatisation down the road, outsourcing etc.?  Have there been discussions with the Minister, the Department or the National Transport Authority on privatisation or outsourcing, which is the other word we have seen in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann?<br\/><br\/>Although it is minor relative to the bigger issues, we are seeing overcrowding on trains.  In my county of Louth there is serious overcrowding on the Dundalk to Dublin train and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  There are intercity trains, such as the train from Belfast to Dublin, but it does not get into Dublin before 9 a.m.  I cringe with embarrassment as there is no other service across Europe like that which would not get workers in before 9 a.m. on a work day.<br\/><br\/>There is also the question of disability access.  I will come to Bus &Eacute;ireann in a moment but as part of the plan to deal with workers and pending strike action in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is there a plan to leave stations unplanned or have certain stations closed and services shut down?  If there is a plan to leave stations unmanned and put staff on trains, how will it affect the 24 hours' notice that wheelchair users must give to use public rail services?  If a person is working in a train station and a person arrives who needs disability access, the worker would be able to get out a ramp and assist the person on to the train.  How will this work in future?<br\/><br\/>What is the opinion of the representative of Bus &Eacute;ireann on what has been happening with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann in County Meath?  I asked a parliamentary question on how many bus drivers have sought redundancy in the past 12 months and since then I have asked how many drivers have left the organisation in that time.  There was mention of the changed management and how rosters were being implemented.  Is the witness confident that is the case?  From what we hear on the ground it is not the case and there is much discontent among workers.  They were previously working an eight-hour day and now it will be a 13 hour shift, with half-hour breaks and no toilet facilities.  I hear from across the board there is much resentment or discontent.  Will the witness explain what exactly is happening in Meath?  Will we see a recurrence of those actions across the board?<br\/><br\/>The witnesses indicated their confidence in a significant improvement in the subsidy, which has been 47%.  That was not announced in the budget and no commitment was given.  The witnesses have clearly been given a commitment so what are the figures in that commitment?<br\/><br\/>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked questions about the tendering process for the 10% of Dublin Bus routes that went to tender and specifically the competitor, Go-Ahead.  Every question she asked received a reply indicating she was seeking commercially sensitive information.  Was the tender made by Dublin Bus cheaper than Go-Ahead and what was the basis for Dublin Bus not securing the tender?<\/p><p>If this is going to be the start of the outsourcing of our public network, would the witness agree that rather than saying that things are commercially sensitive and that nothing can be disclosed until after a contract is awarded, when there is no recourse, it is more appropriate that this information be put in the public domain?  We have seen contracts awarded, for example, for the toll bridges, which have been for 30 years and with compensation if there are insufficient cars on the road or if there are any changes.  It should be explained in the public interest why the contract was awarded to somebody else, when it will be officially awarded if it has not been already, and why the Dublin Bus tender, which was cheaper, was not awarded the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#R00200","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The investigation is not yet complete, but one of the reasons that is likely to emerge from that investigation is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is using manual interventions to a greater extent than it would like.  When there are more manual interventions, there is a greater chance that something will go wrong.  Continued investment in upgrading signalling and so forth would have made that less likely to have happened.  It did not result in injury or anything, but if there was more of that sort of thing, it could over time increase the likelihood of serious safety incidents.  I can confirm that I am not aware of any incident of a serious nature that arose because of failure to maintain the track.  Some of the things that arise are less likely to arise given investment.  The response to that problem is to have the trains go slower.  If the trains go slower, fewer people will use them, and that is the kernel of the issue.  Investing in improved maintenance and improved signalling will allow the railway to run at optimal route speeds and will get more people using the railway.

The board has a safety advisory group which is chaired by the former railway accident investigations manager from the UK.  There is a very rigorous process.  Within the safety infrastructure here in Ireland there is a railway investigation entity, the Railway Safety Commission.  I assure the Deputy that every incident or near miss is the subject of very rigorous assessment and investigation, and any consequences arising from that related to infrastructure, training of staff or anything such as that are subject to a very comprehensive system.  The evidence of that is that the safety record of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, by European standards, is exceptionally high.

The Deputy is correct about the issues of crowding on trains, particularly during the morning peak.  A procurement process has begun to bring rolling stock which was taken out of service a few years ago - it was then surplus to requirements - back into service.  In anticipation of funding coming from the Department, the procurement process to get the stock fully refurbished and up to speed has begun.  Perhaps I am being unduly cautious, and I know this from having been the chief executive of RPA for ten years, but until the letter arrives in December outlining the funding available from the Department, one can never be sure how much is going to be available for the subsequent year.

As the national budget cascades through the various areas of expenditure, it is expected that there will be funding to allow us proceed with refurbishing rolling stock, where the process of procurement and seeking a contractor has begun.

A small amount of cash has been made available from that for fixed infrastructure, which is not ideal because fixed infrastructure needs to be funded by a separate Exchequer allocation.  The principle for the separation between the infrastructure management and the railway undertaking that Deputy O'Keeffe was asking about earlier is that within approximately five years, the funding of the railway needs to be set up so that the railway undertaking - the operating part - breaks even or makes a modest profit., but sufficient funding would never be generated from additional ticket sales to allow us to invest substantially in new signalling or rolling stock.

I do not see opportunities for it in Ireland.  No discussions have taken place.  That is not part of the agenda for anybody involved in the railway in Ireland at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Crowded trains are certainly a concern for us.  I agree that we need more capacity on the routes, including the provincial routes and intercity routes.  The Deputy raised the issue of having improved service on the Belfast-Dublin line, to get a service into Dublin before 9 o'clock.  I wish we had that.  I think it would make a huge difference to the quality of service that we provide.  That will require more rolling stock and if we get the money and the rolling stock, that could be discussed with Northern Ireland Railways.  Money has been spent to ensure that the Enterprise route, where substantial investment took place in the past two years to refresh the rolling stock which looks very well now, is a good quality service.  To make improvements such as the Deputy suggests, including additional services and such, would require more rolling stock.  We are currently at the limit of services that can be provided with the existing fleet of rolling stock.<\/p> <p>  The signalling investment that is now taking place is a major project in the greater Dublin area.  That will help to regulate services better on those lines and to optimise them to have fewer circumstances that might cause a delay for a train coming in from Dundalk, such as having a DART service in its way.  That signalling investment is well under way and is showing benefits.  It makes the service more reliable.  We are aware of the concerns that the Deputy has expressed and we want to invest to make sure that trip is as comfortable as possible for people because that is the only way to get people out of their cars and on to public transport.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned disability access.  The quality of a public transport system can only be measured by how well it provides for mobility-impaired people.  A public transport system that does not serve mobility-impaired people well should not call itself a public transport system at all.  The period of notice required for the system that is currently in place, where people who need that ramp call ahead, has been shortened.

I will start with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Murphy in his opening statement said the customer is central.  I am sorry to say that does not bear out my recent experience with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The only way I can test its commitment to putting the customer at the centre is with the complaints I get from people.  I have ongoing, daily complaints from people left behind regarding the service being provided in a number of places in Kildare.  I talk to the National Transport Authority about this.  They are the only ones who would take a call from me.  I have failed for the past three weeks to receive even a call back from someone in Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is absolutely unacceptable.  The service is erratic in spots.  Double-decker buses are now single-decker buses and the latter do not have the capacity.  People are at risk of losing their jobs.  We are at that point.  This has been going on for weeks.  When I talked to the National Transport Authority, it told me there was an industrial relations issue and that there would be penalties for non-compliance, but that happens quarterly in arrears, so people have been putting up with this erratic service for three months.  If there is an industrial relations issue, it behoves the bus company to tell people that, that is, to put them on alert and not to have a situation where customers go out in the expectation that a bus will turn up, having looked at a timetable, only for it to pass them by when it does turn up because there is a capacity issue.  There is a very serious issue right across the east coast.  Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to come out very publicly and say exactly what is happening and what it is doing about it, otherwise it will lose customers.  It is certainly losing its reputation in this regard and this certainly does not bear out what Mr. Murphy said at the beginning of the meeting.  I even approached the Minister on two occasions and asked him to get me someone who would give me a call back to tell me exactly what is going on in order that I could pass on that information.  Even that has not worked.  I just do not know.  Bus &Eacute;ireann seems to be impregnable at this stage and there is no public relations aspect to it.  The company really needs to deal with this because Kildare is one area where there are very well used routes that will be compromised.<\/p> <p>  I will go on to a number of other questions and I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#W02100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>On that point, if it is helpful, could the witnesses undertake to provide a special Oireachtas email address?

The &euro;9.5 million deficit is up from &euro;6 million.  Mr. Murphy might come back to us and tell us why that is.<\/p><p>Regarding the non-PSO routes, is there a level playing pitch in respect of the competition given that, having talked to the National Transport Authority, it seems pay and pensions are not an issue for competitors?  It is not a like-with-like comparison.  Bus &Eacute;ireann will not be, nor should it be, in a position to look at reducing people's wages or interfering with their pension entitlements.  How then does it expect to compete with other providers who do not have a historical pay and pensions issue?  Am I reading that situation correctly?<\/p><p> Moving to Irish Rail, I note that Mr. Allen has come through the Railway Procurement Agency, where he was chief executive from 2002.  One of the ongoing talking points regarding rail services in the capital concerns the railway order in respect of the DART underground project, which was allowed to lapse for financial reasons.  A lot of money was spent getting to the point where there was a railway order and design in place for the project.  What percentage of that work is still usable and does Mr. Allen see the underground proposal forming part of his vision for the future of Irish Rail?  I see Mr. Barry Kenny of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is in the Public Gallery.  I often refer to his statement some years ago that the DART underground initiative would be the real game changer in terms of increasing the number of passenger journeys.  Does Mr. Allen agree the project is necessary?  The need to build underground was identified in a Dublin Transport Initiative report published in 1996, at a time when transport funding came from the European Union in a thematic way.  One of the arguments made then, more than 20 years ago, in favour of an underground facility was that Dublin was underperforming because of congestion.  Does Mr. Allen see the bringing back into play of the underground project as a central component of efforts to resolve the congestion issue?<\/p><p> In regard to the maintenance costs of &euro;103 million per year over five years, I understand what the chairperson designate is saying in regard to speeds.  If that level of underfunding continues, when will we reach the point where it is not just speeds but safety that is potentially compromised?  I accept that Mr. Allen will not take that risk but can he give us some idea of what risks might present if sufficient funding is not made available?  Maintaining speed capacity is very important in terms of attracting people to use public transport instead of private cars but safety must always be the primary concern.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus is the workhorse of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area.  The same question that arose in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann arises when it comes to Dublin Bus and the awarding of the contract to Go-Ahead, namely, whether there is a fair competition when one is up against a competitor who does not have to match pay and pensions.  How does Mr. Courtney see that issue being overcome and could it compromise other routes?  I accept his point that having a cohesive system is important.  In my own area at one point we had a range of transport operators offering different services at an array of different bus stops.  That type of arrangement is incoherent and difficult for people to navigate, and that can have knock-on consequences.  What does the chairperson designate consider the best approach to take into the future to ensure a cohesive service?  We will have to wait and see how the Bus Connects initiative pans out but it seems to be a useful initiative.  There have been several improvements in bus services in the capital in recent years, including, in particular, the real time information service.  It took a long time for the various companies to get on board with the Leap card but that facility makes public transport much more attractive to people.<\/p><p> Wheelchair users have frequently voiced their concerns regarding the 24-hour notice requirement.

It is an issue that comes up constantly in respect of Dublin Bus.  I accept that it often comes down to the goodwill of passengers, especially those with buggies, but it is not unusual for wheelchair users to have to wait for several buses to pass by before they can board one.  Are additional powers needed for bus drivers to impose rules as to who should have priority?  Would a publicity campaign be helpful to educate the public on the specific needs of wheelchair users who access public transport?  We must give more certainty to people who are dependent on the buses to get around.  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, are there designated stops for wheelchair users in particular locations?  I understand ground gradients are an issue at some stops.  Is a strategic approach being taken to accommodate wheelchair users to a greater degree?<\/p> <p>  In regard to Dublin Bus, Mr. Courtney said the intention is to alleviate short-term congestion.  Does he agree something more than additional bus services is needed to do that?  I realise that in putting this question I may be asking him to sell Dublin Bus short.<\/p> <p>  On climate change, transport, as we all know, is one of the three major polluting sectors.  We can do something with electric cars but how we move forward in more sustainable ways will be a key issue.  How are the chairpersons designate engaging with the mitigation measures that have been identified for the transport sector?  Do they, for example, have a process for informing the Department what is needed to reach the targets?  What involvement do the witnesses have in that particular area of work?<\/p> <p>  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, there have been no new service level agreements between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of school transport services.  As I understand it, the current arrangement has not been updated since 1975 and involves the allocation of a lump sum payment, called the transport management charge or something like that.

The fact that investment was not made as anticipated at the time has resulted in a sprawl, a certain quality of life for people travelling exceptionally long distances and being caught in congestion on the way into the city.  The DTI was right and nothing has happened in the meantime to contradict its conclusion.<\/p> <p>  The initiatives that arose from the DTI, including the Luas, made a significant contribution to improving quality of life when implemented.  Unfortunately, not enough was done, which has resulted in urban sprawl.  The population of Dublin lives in approximately three times the space of a comparable population in continental Europe.  This has adverse consequences in terms of the economy, quality of life and sustainability.<\/p> <p>  Regarding issues that need more urgent attention, for example, sustainability, our commitments as a community to addressing climate change and the national mitigation plan that was published in July, there is no way that we can meet our obligations under those proposals without a change in the number of people travelling using public transport rather than private cars.  This requires high capacity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy referred to how my colleague, Mr. Kenny, stated that the DART underground would be a game changer.  It would be.  The Deputy asked me whether this remained our priority.  In that regard, and given the amount of money that is realistically available to us, I would try to ensure that we protect the quality of public transport for the 45 million people who are using Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann this year, increase capacity on those routes and then determine how to extend further.  The first step will be to determine how to extend electrification of the railway lines, which is a critical part of the DART underground project, incrementally and as soon as possible with a view to having more electrified transport.  Rather than waiting for one big bang, we should be asking which pieces of the overall railway infrastructure can be implemented progressively so that more people can be brought onto it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned deferred maintenance in recent years and the need to catch up on expenditure that had not taken place.  She asked at what stage safety becomes compromised in some way.  The job of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's board and management has to be to worry about safety all of the time.  Everything that takes place has a safety dimension.  We should be worried, and we are.  However, onerous and thorough procedures are in place so that, if a deteriorated infrastructure reaches a stage at which safety specialists believe that passengers are at risk beyond the low point that remains practicable, which is the term that is used, then the service stops.<\/p><p>We are not at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#Y04200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1431,"content":"<p>I will explain my question.

We do not wish to do that but these are the steps that have been taken in response to the type of investigation the Deputy mentioned.  That is done on a daily and ongoing basis.  As that continues if further changes are required to maintain passenger safety, they will happen.  We hope it does not come to that and we are confident that funding will be made available to us to remove those speed restrictions rather than put more of them in place.

In moving ahead with the DART underground in the future, to the extent that the alignment and the design capacity remain the same that design would not require much reworking.  If there are changes they could arise because the pattern of spatial development that has taken place in Dublin in the meantime has changed and we would have to respond to that.  However, a great deal of that technical design work is a solid piece of work.  It will last for a long time and could be used for that and any work we will be doing shortly in electrification.  The board of Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann is considering opportunities to have hybrid rolling stock, that is, rolling stock that uses either diesel or electricity, so it can be used on the diesel track where there is no electrification today and when electrification happens over time.  That will be very important with regard to climate change action.

Certainly, our Expressway services were under threat because our revenues were decreasing due to competition.  In addition, our cost base was out of line.  As a consequence, our financial position worsened by &euro;3.5 million between the two years, which is why we had to take the action that was necessary.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the competition, it is a fact that we are not going to do the race to the bottom.  We have our employees and we have had difficult discussions with them about the future and what we can do, but we have worked out a mechanism for handling that whereby we believe we can compete.  We do not have the same terms and conditions as some of our competitors, nor is that our wish.  We want to have a fair and good approach to our employees that gives us a mechanism to be as efficient as we possibly can be.  There is no reason that we cannot improve our efficiency to compensate for the fact that we pay a better rate to our employees, and we make no complaint about that at all.  Our approach is to improve our efficiency, take down costs wherever we can and take down our non-payroll costs where we can so we can compete in the open market.  It is our intention to do that.  By doing that we believe we can compete and also provide value for money to the State.<\/p> <p>  With regard to wheelchair users, we work closely with the NTA on the provision of service.  The NTA is involved in the procurement of PSO buses and all of those are being fitted with the relevant equipment and so forth to provide a service.  Obviously, it is also up to the local authorities to provide the necessary infrastructure at the bus stops.  We are working with the NTA and we are going along with its strategy in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding climate change, we have looked at alternative energy mechanisms for buses.

That is an issue.  Obviously we must ensure we do not increase our costs beyond where they are.  We will continue to look at all of the options as better new equipment becomes available.

It is the same for us.  We must ensure that ultimately we have an efficient and cost effective system of work.  That includes the cost of labour and the cost of capital.  We are focused on retaining employees and having good, high quality employees who can provide an efficient service to the customers.  At the same time we want them to stay with us as their employer of choice.  On average, most people stay with us.  People are retained in Dublin Bus.<\/p> <p>  We are confident that we can compete with anybody who wishes to compete with us, but we need support in that.  We need support from the Oireachtas and the Labour Court with regard to applications for sectoral employment agreements or employment regulation orders whereby there are policy decisions on the minimum floors which the State believes should not be breached because in those circumstances one always worries about safety and the concerns and standards of drivers.  We have very high standard drivers and high safety standards and we are absolutely confident we can maintain those.  There have been discussions and agreements about that and they are being processed at present.<\/p><p>We can deal with that.  The most important thing is that we have to make change.  I do not know how long I am doing change but at this stage it must be over 30 years.  Where there are trade unions one has to sit down, make agreements, negotiate and do deals.  It does not mean one does not fall out or have difficulties.  Nobody wants to have them, but one does and at the end of the day one has to come to a fair agreement.  We have a responsibility as an employer, as a commercial State company, to be a good and fair employer.  Our employees are very valued.  They are good people.<\/p><p> Reference was made to BusConnects.  It is an investment in the bus network and I think BusConnects is great.  Dublin Bus is also great because it is bus overground.  One does not have to do a whole lot with it other than to provide the buses.  One of the things we did this year was to retain 30 buses that were due to be retired.  We are keeping them in service to try to provide more service where there is congestion and people end up waiting at the bus stop.  Those people are trying to go to work and to engineer the economy to make money.  It is a social backstop as well although it is still seen as cool in the sense that the person in the wheelchair who wants to go to work is as entitled to get on the bus as the able-bodied person.  We work hard to do that.  Our entire fleet is 100% accessible because we have been working on it for some time.  It does happen occasionally - it is not good when it does - that a person has to wait because the wheelchair access is being taken up by another wheelchair or there is a dispute over buggies.  That is something we have to work on and see what we can do.  I have been reminded again today of how important it is to provide a social service to everybody, and not only a social service but an economic service for the person who is going to work.<\/p><p> Short-term congestion troubled me when I worked on the buses 30 years ago and it is still troubling me but there have been huge advances since in terms of the quality bus corridors and bus lanes.  We have a state-of-the-art control centre that works with the Garda to try to keep them open and to keep the traffic moving.  I could go on all night about the separation of bikes and buses.  We all know it would be ideal to separate those who walk from those who are on bikes and those who are in cars.  At the moment, the most important thing is to provide buses.  We are in discussion with the NTA about another 30 buses and the renewal of the fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#Z01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1448,"content":"<p>I wish to make one point on congestion because it would be of great assistance from Bus &Eacute;ireann's point of view.

The witnesses are very welcome.  It has been quite a long morning for them so I will try to be brief.  The Chairman referred to the fact that we have three male witnesses and inquired about gender balance on the board.  That question has been answered but have any of the companies carried out a review of the gender pay gap?  RT&Eacute; thought it did not have a problem until it began to look at the issue closely.  Have the boards considered the issue of a gender pay gap?  I know many of the employees are paid a specific rate, such as that for bus drivers, but there are also many managerial roles and senior executives in the companies.  Have the companies commissioned a review of the gender pay gap and, if so, when do they expect to get the results?<\/p> <p>  We talked about the investment needed for Irish Rail.  Could the witnesses outline what they are bringing to the table?  Irish Rail recently put out to tender a joint development on some of its lands at Grand Canal Harbour where the development of an office block is being considered.  Landbanks are also a factor in several other locations across the network.  What contribution will that make to the investment in infrastructure?  I am aware of the commercial sensitivities in this regard but is it possible to get a global figure for the entire landbank assets?<\/p> <p>  Has Dublin Bus commissioned a review of its land banks, assessed what is there and what can be brought to the table in terms of investment and making sure the company is maximising the returns from the landbanks?  I am not saying Dublin Bus should close any stations but the company must examine whether it is utilising the spaces it has in the best way possible.  If a review has been commissioned, are the results accessible?  How long ago is it since the issue was examined?  The property situation has changed significantly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Dublin Bus, there has been a change with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and I wonder what is the bottom line.  In future, its rolling stock will not go onto its balance sheet.  It will stay on the NTA balance sheet, unlike Irish Rail where its rolling stock will stay on its balance sheet.  Is there a contractual basis to the relationship with the NTA in terms of maintenance and servicing of the fleet and will it have a financial impact on Dublin Bus?  Currently, buses are maintained to a high standard and safety checks are part of that.  Is the NTA placing an additional onus on Dublin Bus given that it will own the stock?  What effect will that have on the balance sheet of Dublin Bus?  The NTA has also been given a role in terms of branding the bus service across the city.  Dublin Bus has invested a lot of money on branding and delivery of service.  Do the witnesses see branding as being a source of conflict between the NTA and Dublin Bus and will it damage the current branding of Dublin Bus?<\/p> <p>  In terms of Irish Rail, electrification is something we all hope will happen.  I know some of its rolling stock has been approved for refurbishment.  When will a decision have to be made on commissioning additional rolling stock?  How long is the lead-in time for that stock?  We can see an increasing demand and decisions will have to be made for 2021 onwards.  If the company does not get approval to order extra carriages, can we have electrification without the rolling stock?  A degree of planning is required.<\/p> <p>  Expressway routes have been under significant pressure from commercial operators especially given that they do not have to stop at any towns and villages on the route.  Have any hub developments been considered for Expressway?  That is short and sweet and I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#AA00600","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1453,"content":"<p>I should have said the former Minister.

There are three transactions in the market at the moment.  One site is near Connolly Station, the other is in a place known as Boston Sidings, which is near the railway line, and a third site is in Galway.

There are three.  Forget the site near Connolly Station.  Those three are in the market.  In terms of beginning the process, the board reviewed them to ensure land was not being sold which might be required for transport infrastructure in the future and to ensure the process being engaged in was the appropriate one to realise the best value for the sites.  My recollection is we did not ask, nor should we have, how much was expected from the sale.  The goal is to maximise the value for the company.  The market will come forward with values.  Then there is a decision to be made about whether those values make sense or not.  I presume some of our property people already have a figure in mind.  I do not know what it is and I do not want to know what it is.  The best approach is to ensure there is a good, clear, transparent process to maximise the value and then to decide whether it is a good idea or not.  That is how it is being done.  That will all come to fruition very shortly.  Tenders are expected before the end of the year so we will know in the coming months whether there are solid proposals.  While the land is technically owned by the CIE group rather than Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, any disposals of that nature are with a view to contributing money to enhance the infrastructure and recover the value of the infrastructure.  As it is owned by CIE, how it is spread out over the various activities is a slightly separate matter.  The money is absolutely to be used to improve transport.  We have asked the property specialists to try to identify any other locations where there is land surplus to current or future requirements and to see how it could be disposed of so that any assets that are available to us are used for the purposes for which we are established which is to provide public transport.  That is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>I am a little bit concerned by Mr. Allen's answer.

That is a separate matter to the disposal of land which is intended to realise funds that can be invested in transport.  The first three transactions are in the market at the moment.  To take account of buoyant market conditions is a positive thing.  When I say a property is in the market, I mean we will know within weeks what value will be realised from it.  There is a property team within the CIE group looking at any other potential disposals.  It will be guided to some extent by the transactions we will know about in the coming weeks.  I hope I have not given the impression it is something we might get around to looking at in the future because that is not the case; it is the subject of very active attention.  With regard to the properties that are the subject of the three transactions in the market at the moment, deciding to prepare them for sale and working out how they would fit with future railway infrastructure takes a bit of time.  This work started some time ago.  It was apparent to the property people and the wider public that there was value there, which was not there two or three years ago.  That will continue and there is urgency.  Some land was sold some years ago as part of the Spencer Dock development and the money was used for the requirements of the company.  It is not something we will get around to in the future; it is very much on people's agenda.  There are people in property working full time on it at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The third point the Senator raised was the timing of decisions regarding electrification.  In some respects, that decision has been made already.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has a fleet strategy which favours hybrid rolling stock that can use either overhead catenaries or diesel.  We have already made the decision to go that route.  We have reviewed the product offerings and technical specifications and how they would fit our network.  That has already happened.  There are commitments to additional funding so we do not have to make a decision; the decision has already been made.  We can go to the market very quickly to procure rolling stock that will have the required flexibility and will not depend on exactly the scenarios the Senator described in which we do not know which way to go.  We can do both at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#BB00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Allen"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1464,"content":"<p>I think we are almost finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#BB00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1465,"content":"<p>I asked two questions to either Mr. Murphy or Mr. Courtney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#BB01000","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508918400,"counter":1466,"content":"<p>We do not have a gender pay gap issue since we have specific remuneration for positions regardless of the employee who fills them.  We have not undertaken a specific review but I can confirm there are no gender pay gap issues in the company.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Allen referred to the property issue.  The properties are managed by CIE centrally and there is a property manager.  The policy is to maximise the potential of any surplus property.  Any properties that are identified as being required currently or which may be required are retained and every opportunity is taken to realise the value of everything else whether through outright sale or, more preferably, by establishing an ongoing revenue stream from the properties.  There have been some very innovative deals done by the property manager in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Expressway, I have mentioned the competition issue and we are dealing with it head-on.  Our biggest hub is Dublin Airport because the majority of our Expressway services either originate there or it is their destination.  It is a major hub for us and we are looking at opportunities around that.  We have Bus&aacute;ras, which is a central city location, and Parnell Place in Cork.  We also have hubs in the rail stations in Limerick and Galway.

Pay is based on grade.  The last senior appointment we had was a lady to the chief financial officer's position.  Unfortunately, we took it from Mr. Murphy's organisation.  We take the best people wherever we can find them.<\/p> <p>  The situation with property is quite similar.  We have the garages and so on but we have absolutely no plans to divest ourselves of them because they are part of our strategic investment in the Dublin area.  They are very important to how we provide services across the city.  Outside of that, I am not aware of any other property we will be disposing of.  It is under the control of CIE group property division.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked a very interesting question about the NTA, buses and branding and so on.  It is a very important question because it comes down to the whole idea of what kind of bus company we want in Dublin.  Dublin Bus will be there for some considerable time regardless of what policy changes are made.  The question always arises about the nature of it.  The Dublin Bus brand is very important to us and we use it in all our marketing.  People talk about livery but we never do.  Instead we talk about branding, marketing and positioning.  It is very important to us to protect that brand and it is very important it is there into the future.  What happened in London is often cited.<\/p><p>They had different operators but kept the red buses.  My humble submission is that whatever changes happen, please keep the Dublin Bus colours.  They are very important to the company, and are also a very valuable asset to the State.  It is valued at &euro;28 million and could go up over the next few years, depending on expansion, to &euro;33 million.<br\/><br\/>We are talking about the efficient use of assets.  An asset of the State cannot just be given away.  It is important to protect the brand, and one of the principal duties of the board is to protect the assets of the State and get the maximum value for them.  Notwithstanding that, we have been engaged with the NTA<b>. <\/b>Dublin Bus has been driving this, because it has the expertise in branding.  It set up a brand room, which everyone, including Ministers and officials from the Department, wanted to see, showing what a new branding concept for Dublin Bus, which would protect the brand and the value that it has, would look like, and presented the idea of a new, innovative and modern service.  Dublin Bus is not afraid of change or of looking at branding, but it is going to protect its assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017102500002#BB01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508918400,"counter":1469,"content":"<p>This question might require a lengthy answer and I am quite conscious of time.
