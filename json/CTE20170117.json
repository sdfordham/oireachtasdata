When I was drawing up my opening statement I had to make some suppositions and assumptions about what the British position might be.  This morning, we heard the British Prime Minister lay out in clear terms what her strategy is and it is not good news for the Irish agrifood sector.<br\/><br\/>The way to try to understand this is to recall 1973, when both Ireland and the United Kingdom joined what was then the European Economic Community, EEC, and later the European Union.  Before that time we were selling into the British market, obviously in competition with other exporters, and we were getting essentially the world market price.  There was some opportunity under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement to benefit from some of the deficiency payments the UK had at the time for some of our livestock exports, but basically we were selling at world market prices.  For us, joining the European Union at the same time as the British meant that we got the benefit of the protection provided by the common external tariff.  The Common Agricultural Policy was important but this tariff wall required the British consumer to pay the higher EU price rather than the world market price after membership.  Irish exporters were able to benefit from what I call that trade transfer.  We were able to benefit because we were protected in selling to that market after membership <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>third countries that were outside the tariff wall.  For me, the announcement by the British Prime Minister today that she is not seeking to remain within the customs union is probably the most significant part of her statement.  I believe we will see the UK reverting to a less protectionist position for its agriculture.  I am not suggesting that it will go to zero tariffs, but it is highly unlikely that it will retain the high level of tariffs we have in Europe.<br\/><br\/>We also heard her say in no uncertain terms that she wishes Britain to be open to trade with the rest of the world.  She wishes to sign trade agreements, which would embrace many competitive agricultural exporters, so we can expect to see that even if we maintain duty free access to the United Kingdom market under a free trade agreement, and I will comment on that shortly, it will be a far less valuable market for us in the future.  That is the biggest difficulty I foresee for the Irish agrifood sector following Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The British Prime Minister has indicated that she will seek a free trade agreement.  That is an important objective for Ireland also, so that at least we will not have tariffs put on our exports in addition to the lower market price when exporting to the UK market.  Of course, the value of that free trade agreement will depend on the size of the tariffs which the UK Government decides to put in place once it has the ability to do so.  To take an extreme situation, and I do not believe it is likely, if the United Kingdom were to decide to eliminate tariffs on its agrifood imports, a free trade agreement does not really mean anything because we, along with the Brazilians, New Zealanders and Australians, would have duty free access anyway.  In that case the free trade agreement is not very important.  It is important to the extent that the UK retains some positive protection for its farmers after Brexit.  I expect it to do so, therefore the suggestion that the UK will at least seek a free trade agreement is one of the few positive things we can take from the statement today.<br\/><br\/>It will take time to negotiate a free trade agreement.  The withdrawal from the Union is negotiated under Article 50 of the treaty but negotiating a free trade agreement is a different negotiation under Article 218, with its own rules, Council mandate and so forth.  There is much concern, which I share, that it is not clear if the European Union will be able to start negotiating such a free trade agreement until the United Kingdom has left the EU.  This, of course, raises the question of the cliff edge.<\/p><p>A free trade agreement, which will be negotiated under a separate set of procedures, could well take longer than the actual withdrawal negotiation itself.  If the British timeline is held to and Brexit occurs in spring 2019, I think it is unlikely we will see a free trade agreement in place by then.  Accordingly, the question of what transitional arrangements might be put in place to avoid the re-imposition of tariffs is an important strategic issue for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the free trade element, the UK Prime Minister has indicated that Britain wishes to withdraw from the Single Market.  The Single Market has allowed us to trade, not only with the United Kingdom but with other EU countries in a seamless way without the administrative checks and paperwork required before 1992 when it came into effect.  We are going to see some additional trading costs simply because the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the Single Market.  What will these additional costs be?  For example, an Irish meat factory, once it is inspected by the Irish authorities and approved to sell its products on the Irish market, can also sell those products on the British and French markets without any further checks.  It is assumed it will meet the relevant EU standards.  That will no longer be the case after Brexit.  The British authorities may decide to change when they leave.  They will have exactly the same regulations in place that we have.  However, over time, these regulations may evolve and change.  In any case, the British authorities will wish to ensure our processing plants meet their standards.<br\/><br\/>We will need to ensure these additional costs are minimised as far as possible.  It is possible to do this through mutual recognition agreements where two sides agree to recognise each other's agencies and systems for approving, say, plants for food safety and other reasons.  Again, however, that is a trade agreement which has to be signed by the Commission for that mutual recognition to take place.<br\/><br\/>What agricultural policy will the United Kingdom, and its devolved administrations whose responsibility that policy is, pursue after Brexit?  What support will it give through its budget to its farmers?  That is a significantly important question for farmers in the North of Ireland who are heavily dependent on direct transfers at the present time.  With supply chains which link production in the North with processes in the South, there will be issues as to how that level of production may be affected in the future if support is reduced under UK agricultural policy.<br\/><br\/>There are also indirect effects of Brexit.  Obviously, we are all familiar with the exchange rate impacts.  There will be indirect effects from the impact of Brexit on future economic growth rates and migration into the United Kingdom, which obviously will impact on the overall level of demand for Irish exports.  It is clear the UK is a major net contributor to the EU budget and, therefore, to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  After Brexit, there will be a hole in that budget.  Will that be replaced by the other member states?  Several tables in my submission indicate the key sectors which will be mostly affected by Brexit.<br\/><br\/>In my submission, I made six recommendations to the committee to consider.  On the first one, the ship may well have sailed, as it emphasised the importance of encouraging the United Kingdom to remain within the customs union.  One issue is the revenue from the tariffs, which are currently paid into the European budget and are, therefore, a cost to the United Kingdom.  There would have been scope for the United Kingdom to retain that revenue.  It seems, however, the UK Prime Minister has ruled that option out today.<br\/><br\/>In that case, we need to emphasise the importance of concluding a free trade agreement which also covers agrifood trade.  That is not a foregone conclusion.  For example, the European Economic Area agreement does not itself cover agriculture, although there are bilateral agricultural agreements with the members of that agreement.  There are trade-offs involved.  The committee will be aware that the most important UK agricultural export to the rest of Europe is lamb.  The UK is actually self-sufficient in lamb.  The lamb exported is, in a sense replaced, by lamb imported from New Zealand.  If, after Brexit, the UK enters into a free trade agreement with New Zealand, a lot more New Zealand lamb might go into Britain.  One can expect Welsh lamb to be diverted to France in competition with Irish lamb exports.  Is that something with which we would be happy?  Would we want to put a quota on future British lamb exports to avoid that?  In that case, the British would be clearly looking for a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>.  Would they then want to limit exports of interest to us?  There are going to be difficult trade-offs, even in negotiating a free trade agreement.<br\/><br\/>With respect to leaving the Single Market, it is important to underline the importance of mutual recognition agreements to ensure each trading partner recognises the systems in place to approve, for example, veterinary and food safety equivalence.  Clearly we will need to emphasise marketing efforts.  The British market inevitably will be less attractive to our exporters.  We are going to need to provide assistance to look for alternatives either in the rest of the European Union or outside.<br\/><br\/>Brexit is going to be a big negative shock.  We will hear calls for assistance, both from smaller food firms and farmers.  My advice is that this is a permanent shock.  This is not something which is likely to reverse itself in the near future.  Accordingly, if assistance is to be provided, it should be targeted to assist the sector to adjust.  It should not be something which is simply a hand-out to keep the sector going without helping it to adjust.  It is an unfortunate situation but one with which I am afraid we are going to have to live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his thought-provoking presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#D00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for taking the time to present to the committee, as well as for his ongoing research as an agricultural economist and his contribution to the agricultural sector.<\/p><p>I have a couple of key questions.  Today's well-flagged announcement by the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, on the UK's intention to go for a hard Brexit is, as the witnesses pointed out, quite concerning for agriculture more so than any other sector.  It raises many serious questions with which we are going to have to grapple.  Professor Matthews said that he would flesh out his view on the various sectors if he asked to do so.  I would certainly be interested in hearing his view.  He mentioned lamb and I would like to hear his perspective, which will be different to those relating to other sectors.  I would like to hear his thoughts on how Brexit will affect the various sectors.<\/p><p> It is difficult to estimate but what would be the potential loss to the value of our various sectors in the event of a hard Brexit?  I am also interested in the witness's perspective on where Brexit might leave British agriculture.  It is not what we are looking at in this committee but I would like to hear the comparative analysis in respect of it.<\/p><p> What is Professor Matthew's perspective on the quest for new markets in the event of having to find alternatives?

The witness raised a couple of issues in his presentation that I wish to return to.  He mentioned the standards we have here and the standards in Britain.  Many people are saying that when Britain leaves, if it wants to export its goods to the EU, it will also have to maintain the standards the EU have.  The campaign for Brexit was very much based on the rhetoric of getting rid of all the red tape, tossing away Europe and not having to comply with all of its standards.  If it tosses away the standards, Britain will only be able to trade with itself.  Therefore, I believe the argument that was put at that time does not hold water.<\/p> <p>  The witness spoke about the free trade agreements and the customs union, which is bigger than the EU, and involves Turkey, the Isle of Man, and many other countries, was a stepping stone towards the EU.  It is almost like the Single Market, or the common market as we first called it in the 1970s.  That is effectively what the customs union is.  To say that the UK is going to step outside of that union seems an almost incredible step to take, beyond even what was being demanded.  Most people said that Brexit was about leaving the EU, but now they are leaving the customs union as well.  I do not understand what logical benefit the British Prime Minister can bring to the table for the British people by leaving the customs union.  Perhaps the witness can enlighten us on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his thought-provoking analysis.  From listening to him, I definitely would not like to be a farmer in Northern Ireland or the UK facing the consequences of this British decision.  Professor Matthews mentioned Northern Ireland farmers and their dependence on direct payments in particular.  If I was a farmer in Northern Ireland, I would be extremely worried about how that will happen in a post-Brexit scenario.<\/p> <p>  There is analysis needed of how the UK agricultural industry will survive, particularly if a cheap food policy is pursued.  The UK's beef industry has been promoted fairly intensively over the last couple of years.  There were campaigns for Scottish beef and for buying British.  If the UK allows imports in from South America on a tariff-free basis, how will its own industry survive the onslaught?  The other question is about the co-dependency and the processing capacity.  How will that work out in a tariff environment?  In the dairy industry, Northern Ireland is massively dependent on southern processing facilities.  Approximately 3 million litres of milk are transported across the Border each day.  We are seriously dependent on Northern Ireland's capacity in the pig industry.  A significant number of pigs are transported across the Border to be slaughtered.  With a tariff situation or a strict Border, how will the practicalities in this regard work?<\/p> <p>  The professor mentioned lamb exports.  How can the UK have its cake and eat it?  If it wants access to the French market, how can it deny us access to its own market?  If the UK wants to export lamb, there will have to be a lot of serious talking done.  I would fear that lamb exports will be sacrificed for the idea of cheap food in the UK market.  I would like to hear the view of Professor Matthews on that.<\/p> <p>  The sector that is most exposed is our beef sector.  A total of 50% of our beef is exported to the UK market.  I would not have many concerns for dairy because the worldwide price for dairy is fairly similar.  Whether a litre of milk is produced in New Zealand, the United States or in Europe, there is not a huge dissimilarity in price.  I do not see huge difficulties on that side of it.  However, there is a significant worldwide difference in the price of beef.  If we look back ten or 15 years, we exported a huge amount of our beef outside of the EU.  There was a policy decision taken that the EU was the best market on which to focus.  That decision was taken by Bord Bia and I sat on that board at the time.  The prime intention was to sell all of our beef within EU borders.  In a way, that is coming back to haunt us now in that we left markets to which we will now have to return in order to sell beef.<\/p> <p>  What kind of a timescale does the Professor Matthews foresee in order to reduce that 50% dependency down to single digits?  Is it possible to re-establish the markets we left ten or 15 years ago on an economic basis?  Can we economically export into those markets again at our cost of production?  If the answer to that is no, then we have serious problems in our beef sector.  I am not questioning the decision that was taken in good faith to leave those markets, but now 50% of our market could be pulled out from under us.  Does the witness see a timescale, or is it economically possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for those questions, which cover a very broad field.  First of all, in terms of the sector, Deputy McConalogue is absolutely right.  The beef market is clearly the most vulnerable.  The way to look at it is in terms of the degree of self-sufficiency for the product in the UK and then the difference between the UK and the world market price.  In the case of dairying, I agree that the price differences are less.  There will still be a challenge to find alternative markets, for example, if we need to diversify somewhat.  There is still probably a premium for some of the dairy products, but much less so than in the case of beef, lamb and poultry.  I am of the view, therefore, that meat products will be most affected.  Some of the more processed products, such as the infant formula, beers and spirits, are also less dependent on the UK market.  Obviously, the value added back to the farmer is much smaller in the context of these industries.  In terms of looking at the impact at the farm gate, it is essentially the meat sector in which we are going to see problems.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about the future of UK agriculture.  As the Deputy said, it is not directly of concern to the committee but it is of great interest nonetheless.  We have seen very little guidance as yet from the Ministers at the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as to what they might be thinking.  They have promised a consultation with their farmers.  There are very strong environmental interest groups in the UK, which is a very densely-populated country.<\/p><p>These interest groups would like to see more of the funding go towards environmental improvements, but the National Farmers Union is keen to see as much of it as possible retained to provide income support.  Given what the United Kingdom has stated in the past, it is clear that it will probably support its farmers to a lesser extent.  Having said that, I do not assume it will reduce the level of support to zero.  We will probably not have clarity on the question for at least a two-year period while consultations are under way.<\/p><p> There was a question about new markets.  I agree that we have been successful in moving away from dependence on the UK beef market.  It seems that we will have to continue in that regard.  The UK market will be less attractive; we will, therefore, be looking to try to diversify further.  The markets outside the European Union present a problem in that they are less valuable than the EU market.  I am unsure whether I would necessarily suggest we give up these markets, but once export subsidies went, it was clear that we were competing in them at world prices.  It may well be that in the case of some commodities world prices will recover in the future and these markets may become more attractive again.  However, I believe the EU market will be the most obvious place to start, but that is not to say some of the Asian markets where demand is growing will not play a greater role in the future.<\/p><p> The question was asked by Deputy Ferris whether the United Kingdom would have to meet EU standards.  He also asked about the value of the United Kingdom leaving.  That was a question voters in the United Kingdom had to answer in the referendum.  Even if the United Kingdom was to retain the same standards in the future, the actual mechanisms for recognising those standards would be different simply because the United Kingdom would be outside the Single Market.  I share Deputy Ferris' point of view in the sense that even if the standards were to remain the same, many of them are international and not necessarily EU standards.  They are agreed to under the Codex Alimentarius and by other standard setting bodies.  The key issue is who would get to decide whether the UK or Irish plant, depending on the direction of trade, was meeting the standards of the trading partner.  That represents an extra step.  It would involve not only approving the plants but also inspecting consignments crossing borders, at least on the basis of risk.  There would be additional costs that we should try to minimise as much as possible.<\/p><p> I agree that the issues surrounding supply chains with the North will need close consideration.  I am unsure who asked the question, but someone asked whether there was an overall estimate of the cost of Brexit.  I am aware that Teagasc has done some work on this issue.  Now that there is a little more clarity about the scenarios involved, I imagine Teagasc will be working on modelling estimates.  I do not have a figure that I could give to the committee, but I know that Teagasc is working on the issue.<\/p><p> Two issues arise specifically about the North, the first of which is whether the production base might contract if support was to be reduced relative to the current arrangement.  The second concerns the greater complexity of moving supplies across the Border.  For the larger players, this might not be such a great issue because they would be able to handle Customs declaration forms and inspections.  I reckon it would be a bigger problem for smaller firms that only export intermittently but for which it could be an important source of additional revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will move to the next round of questions.

One of the key issues facing the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the response to CAP reform and how it will fit in if Brexit materialises, with particular reference to a reduction in the UK budget.  The figure touted as being the possible reduction is 18% in the net contribution the United Kingdom makes to the budget.  If such a drastic cut to the CAP budget were to materialise, it would have major knock-on effects on the tillage and beef industries, as well as throughout the entire agricultural framework.  How does Professor Matthews propose that it be dealt with?  Does he believe member states will decide to step in and bridge the gap, given what is happening on the eastern side of Europe?  If there was to be a 20% cut in the budget in the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy, what impact would it have on agricultural output in Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Two issues arise with Brexit, the first of which is the trade impact, while the second is the major issue of the CAP payment for this country.  Statistics from Teagasc for beef and grain production suggest farmers survive on the single farm payment.

As he said, this has the potential to be an economic and administrative nightmare, one which will have a seismic impact on the general economy and, in particular, the agrifood industry.  Apart from the price differential, there will be a difficulty in securing alternative markets.  We should be clear about this rather than live in an ivory tower or fantasy land.  There will be currency fluctuations, tariffs, customs barriers to regulate, veterinary inspections, phytosanitary controls and so on, but there is a sense of utopia around the place.  I wonder whether I am in a different place altogether when I hear people suggest we can influence the outcome.  We will have a major job to try to hold back this barrier.<\/p> <p>  The country has produced Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025, one of which I realise is within Government control, while the other is outside its control.  They will have to be reviewed carefully.  Prudent advice will have to be furnished to farmers in the coming years, but there will be a major hullabaloo and everyone will be whinging.<\/p><p>Deputy Cahill is right.  I come from a beef area.  It is hard enough now to produce beef economically and profitably, so what will it be like in this new scenario?  There is a challenging environment ahead.  We must accept that the UK agriculture industry has always been treated as a Cinderella industry by UK Governments.  Their focus is on consumers.  Only ten or 15 years ago, 19% or 20% of what they consumed originated in Brazil and Argentina.  That was reduced to 9% under the trade agreement approximately ten years ago, so already there is potential for the UK to bring in another 11% without any big deal.  That means our 50% will be hit straight away.  We had better realise that the UK will start with cheaper food imports for their consumers and with environmental objectives.  We should know that.  In the UK's overall view, the wider industrial and services sectors are as important as agriculture and the car industry dwarfs all of that.  We need only consider one big factory in Sunderland.  The UK made sure that Nissan was going to be secured.  The farmers will be on the outside, and that will be an issue.<\/p><p> In that context, one would not want to have today's announcement.  As Professor Matthews said, it is a clean break with the trading bloc and the customs union.  Even some of the right wing Tory newspapers last night were not predicting that.  They thought it might well be kept in reserve, but the entire flush of cards came out today.<\/p><p> The UK is a net contributor of &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion to the budget.  I have been speaking about this regularly.  Approximately &euro;7 of every &euro;10 in the CAP budget goes on direct payments.  Without the UK there will be a massive hole in the bucket.  Is it credible, as some people in this country have started saying, that other countries will be asked to contribute to fill that hole?  We must start asking these questions.  Is it the more likely scenario that member states will be asked to make bigger contributions, moving towards almost the co-financing of schemes?  That would raise significant issues for this country.  One does not replace &euro;11 billion in a budget in seconds.  This could be serious and I consider it very serious.  We might well work our way through the other issues in a slow way, not totally neutralising the impacts of today's announcement, but this matter is huge.  Other countries will be looking for a bigger slice of the cake and they will say we have reached the development zone.  Does Professor Matthews think this will be the issue or am I wrong?  Member states will have to make a larger contribution and that would be a significant move towards co-financing, which would be an absolute disaster for us.  We have always articulated that over the years.  Those are the scenarios that now emerge and they trouble me.  We all have an obligation to the more than 100,000 productive farmers in the farming community and the approximately 250,000 people in the agrifood industry who depend on them.  We must be up-front with them and tell them what this means, in so far as we can.<\/p><p> Until today, the only certainty was the uncertainty.  Now, instead of paddling along there is something of a foundation.  Professor Matthews, whom I have known for a number of years, will now be in a position to give better prognostications of the impacts.  He produced a paper six or eight months ago and he probably will revise that, as will the Teagasc economists.  Even in terms of our report, if we consider all of the evidence we have received over the last seven or eight weeks, today's announcement transcends all of that and changes the dynamic of the report we will prepare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#F00500","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Senator Lombard and Deputy Penrose raised the question of the budget gap, so I will make a brief comment on that.  I estimate the figure for the net contribution per annum to be &euro;10 billion to &euro;11 billion.  It has varied a little over the last few years because there have been revisions in national accounts and so forth.  As a percentage of the expenditure in the remaining 27 member states, which is approximately &euro;138 billion, it is not quite as big as 18%.  It is 7% or 8%.  One of the things about other member states making up that gap is that it would not be proportional.  In other words, each member state would not be asked to increase its net contribution by 7% or 8%.  Due to the complexities surrounding the British rebate, four member states get a rebate on having to pay for the British rebate.  In other words, they do not pay as much of that rebate.  If the British rebate goes, these countries will lose that financial advantage.  The four countries concerned, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Austria, would be asked to pay possibly up to 15% more into the budget.  I noted with interest last week that the German state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Spahn, said there was no automatic requirement or expectation that the existing member states would make up the gap in the budget.<br\/><br\/>There are some ways in which the gap could be filled, although I am not suggesting that Ireland should look for these.  However, if tariffs were re-introduced on trade between the EU and the UK, for example, that tariff revenue would be an additional source of revenue to the EU budget and would compensate, to some extent, for some of the loss.  I am not suggesting that we should look to re-impose tariffs, quite the opposite, but that could be the way to secure additional budget revenue.  The Prime Minister was quite vehement that she did not want to continue with what she called vast transfers into the EU budget in the future, but she did not rule out some payments into the EU budget.  In most cases, these are payments for which the UK would get a <i>quid pro<\/i><i>quo<\/i>.  They would be payments into the Horizon 2020 programme or the Erasmus student exchange programme where the UK would expect to get money back.  In other words, it is not a net gain to the EU budget.  The UK will also probably wish to stay in some of the EU agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency, and it will pay a share for that.  It could be the case that at least over a transition period the UK might continue to make what could be called unrequited payments, namely, payments for which it does not get something in return and which therefore would be available to finance general EU budget expenditure.  However, I do not believe the sums involved would be very significant.<br\/><br\/>We will talk about the CAP budget presently, where we can make other general comments.  Brexit will certainly put pressure on that budget, but the CAP budget was probably going to be under pressure from other challenges which we can discuss later.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Penrose quite correctly raised the British attitude to farming, cheap food and so forth.  Again, the qualification to bear in mind is that agriculture in the UK under its devolved government is now a responsibility of the devolved administrations.  It is quite clear that the attitudes of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to agriculture are somewhat different from the attitude in England.  The question is whether the devolved administrations will have the resources through their block grants to implement somewhat different policies.  Agriculture policy is a devolved responsibility in the UK, so we might see some differences across the United Kingdom in the future.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about the importance of the all-Ireland dimension.<\/p><p>The ability to move products and purchase raw materials, animals and so on, without having to worry, not just about the Border but what it means in terms of different regulatory regimes, is very important.  It is a huge benefit to us.  We have seen businesses build very profitable supply chains in both directions on the basis of being able to move products North and South.  There will be a threat to that and it will be more difficult in future, despite the hopes expressed, in a sense, that we will have a soft Border.  There are clearly ways in which we can try to minimise those issues.  For example, we might see electronic and information technology systems used in customs administration and so on that could minimise some of those costs.  It is clearly not a progressive move that we could welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I had a question on the status for the North of Ireland and Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Yes.

I had the benefit of seeing his presentation before but it is timely that he has given it today, when the British Prime Minister set out the objectives.  In many ways, what she said is contradictory.  She seems to hope for the best and does not want membership of the Single Market or the customs union.  There are riders on the objectives.  It must be clear to us that the writing is on the wall.  If she gets the concessions she wants, it will interfere with the integrity of the European Union.  Everything about this smacks of going backwards on Britain's part.  There is the idea that it will again be a global trading nation but the concept of the sun never going down on the British Empire comes to mind.  It seems to be some sort of delusion but I respect that people voted that way.<\/p> <p>  We have had much discussion on this matter.  Our Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May in the context of this issue as it relates to Northern Ireland.  He has also approached the leaders of other member states.  The reality is that for us to get what we want and remain a member state of the Union, we must go to Europe and not Britain.  Do we need a sharper focus?  Nobody can argue but that this is bad for us from an economic and social perspective, as well as with regard to the Northern Ireland issue as a special case.  We must calculate what will be the loss to us.  Of course, we, as progressive Europeans, will try to mitigate that and seek a package from Europe.  We must say to Europe that this is how it will be.  No matter what Prime Minister May says, Britain is not really worried about us.  I do not know if she is really worried about the North of Ireland either to be honest, particularly in light of the way the British Government has behaved.  This could be like a red-letter day.  We can have platitudes - they will keep flowing - and we can talk but suddenly we will wake to the reality, which will not be good.<\/p> <p>  One of the first meetings the committee held involved a discussion with mushroom growers.  We can see the devastation being wrought on them just as a result of sterling's collapse.  We will be looking at fluctuations in sterling, at tariffs, as alluded to, as well as at cheaper agricultural imports.  Prime Minister May can proclaim that she wants the European Union to stay together but she is moving towards undermining all that.  We must make the best of a bad situation but we will have to call it a bit more.  Is that not what we must do?<\/p> <p>  We must go to Europe and seek a package.  We cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hound on this because there is a principle at stake.  If Europe gives too many concessions to the UK and it works out over time with the British delighted, it will be the death knell for Europe as everybody will want more of the same.  We do not know what this is about except disintegration.  We have seen President-elect Trump's attitude to the disintegration of Europe.  We must take stock of our position.

This meeting clashes with that of another committee.  I have two questions but if they have already been answered, we can move on.  In the opening statement there was an indication that the UK would have some obligation to open tariff rate quotas under World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules and provide market access to traditional exporters.  I presume the Irish agrifood sector could be classified as traditional exporters to the UK under the WTO trade rules.  The recommendations indicate we should seek duty-free access to the UK market under WTO or autonomous tariff rate quotas.  When should we start doing that or should we start having those conversations now as a worst-case scenario.  This might lead to pre-approved traditional exports under WTO rules.<\/p> <p>  There is also the option of mutual recognition agreements negotiated by the Commission.  The Commission would probably not look very kindly on us seeking those in advance of Brexit, given that it will negotiate directly with the UK as well.  Tactically, should we discuss the WTO tariff rate quotas with the UK at this stage?  Should we speak with the Commission about mutual recognition agreements in order to set out our stall.  It seems there will be a WTO arrangement for a period after Brexit so we should not lessen the impact on trade.

I have a couple of brief questions for the witness.  In the main, we have spoken about the challenges of Brexit.  Are there agricultural opportunities for us?  How best can we challenge or take advantage of the opportunities?<\/p> <p>  As for the timeframe, the Prime Minister has indicated that she will trigger Article 50 before the end of March.  A two-year process will follow but as we all know, it may take longer.  Since the people of the UK voted on 23 June last, there has been a great deal of uncertainty.

I have no good news on that front.  In terms of a timeframe and regarding uncertainty, the first of 12 principles mentioned by the Prime Minister today was a need for certainty.  It is clear that we are into a negotiation on the initial phase of Article 50 that may last 18 months, if things go well.  There will be a need for at least six months for ratification etc.  One can imagine that there will be many occasions during that period when the newspapers will get hold of a leaked statement claiming the two sides are at loggerheads and headlines proclaiming talks will collapse or Britain will walk away without an agreement or whatever.  The foreign exchange will react to such news.  I agree with the Chairman that we will face an uncertain period.  From an Irish point of view, it is key that we set out what we think are the best negotiating outcomes.  During the negotiations we must focus on those outcomes and not be swept along on the tide of public opinion.<\/p> <p>  The EU negotiating position was mentioned by Senator Mulherin and others.  I think it is a balancing act.  From an Irish point of view we would like to retain close trading links with the United Kingdom, which is in our interest.  She put her finger on the difficulty by asking what is the point of membership if the UK is given too favourable a deal.  She wondered what differentiates membership from being on the outside but having all of the advantages.  It is probably in our interest to keep the UK as close to us as possible.  It looks like we will not be able to keep the UK in the customs union and it also wants to leave the Single Market.  In terms of the free trade agreement, however, Ireland wants to try to retain tariff-free trade.  That is where the impact of the industrial lobbies in the other member states may help us because they also will try to ensure that no new trade barriers are erected.  I warn that there is a precedent in these kinds of trade agreements for the agriculture and food sectors to be treated somewhat differently and not necessarily covered by the same general arrangements.  We may need to watch that we do not end up with less favourable arrangements for the food and agriculture sectors but a good deal on cars, which obviously would not help us.<\/p> <p>  The following two issues also were raised.  Can we argue that Ireland is more exposed to the adverse effects of Brexit than other member states?  If so, can we seek financial assistance from the EU budget?  This is important and is worth thinking about.  There are some arguments that we might find it difficult to do that, with one being that Ireland is a relatively rich member state, particularly after the revaluation of our GDP in 2015.  While it has not really affected us in our pockets, the statistics indicate that Ireland still is one of the richer member states.  If one of the responses to Brexit is to try to provide assistance to firms to enable them to diversify their exports to the EU market, then other member states obviously might not be that happy.  The Dutch and the Danes also will be seeking alternative markets if the UK opens up to the Brazilians, New Zealanders etc. in a much bigger way than at present.  Member states will question why Irish exporters get assistance while they do not.  As the implications of Brexit become clearer, it will be worth making the case to the Commission to argue for transitional support.  The Irish Government may want to provide support and the EU may provide co-funding.  It is important that we at least make the case for support.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid that I have no expertise in the fisheries sector and must pass on the question.  I recognise that fisheries is a huge issue. <\/p> <p>  I have mentioned that the issue of tariff-rate quotas, TRQs, might be important if we end up with the British withdrawing after two years without a trade agreement in place.  In other words, TRQs are irrelevant if we have a free trade agreement because we would have full access without tariffs.  TRQs are a fallback position if, after two years, the unthinkable situation occurs and we are trading with the UK on these so-called WTO terms.  There would be no point in raising that question once the tariffs are in place.  Clearly, we would need to negotiate with the United Kingdom if it began to look as if, for procedural reasons or negotiating reasons, a free trade agreement was not possible.<\/p><p>That would be the context in which tariff rate quotas may play a role but they are not one of the immediate issues because clearly we would hope that we could retain duty-free access through a free trade agreement. <\/p><p> Mutual recognition agreements are different because they will be necessary to avoid some of the negative consequences of the UK leaving the Single Market.  We know that is going to happen, so we know that we need to put in place mechanisms whereby both sides will agree to recognise inspections, approvals and so on done by the other side.  This does not only affect the food industry.  As can be seen if one looks at the most recent report from the House of Commons on Brexit earlier this week, which entailed meeting business people in the north of England, it affects, for example, the pharmaceutical industry.  They will be unclear as to whether their products can be sold legally in the European Union the day after Brexit because they will not necessarily have the clearances and certificates they will need unless there are some mutual recognition procedures in place.  It is not only food that will be affected by this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The mutual recognition agreements obviously need to be in place before Brexit happens.

As this is the committee's first opportunity to begin to look at this issue, I thought it might be useful to highlight the timeline as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that the Commission has indicated in its annual work programme that the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development, DG AGRI, should &ldquo;take forward work and consult widely on simplification and modernisation of the Common Agricultural Policy\".  DG AGRI seems to be taking this as an open-ended invitation to consult on the possible changes to the CAP in the period after 2020.  It has promised a public consultation, which I understand may take place over a three-month period launched towards the end of February.  Based on the responses to that, there then will be an impact analysis of the different options.  The Commission will come forward with three, four or five different options and will look at the implications of those.  Then, towards the end of the year, we might expect a communication setting out its preferred options and the reasons for its choice.  There will obviously be reactions to that, including from the Council of Ministers and from the Parliament, which eventually, possibly in the spring of next year, would lead to legislative proposals from the Commission.  As everyone is aware, there is a particular timing issue in that the current Parliament probably will have its last sittings in the spring of 2019 while the Commissioner will be there until October 2019.  Whether there would be enough time for the co-decision process to allow any firm conclusion to the discussion that might begin next year is an open question.  While there will be a lot of discussion, whether it will actually result in legislative changes is something which the committee might want to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  Second, I will comment very generally on the types of issues I would expect to see raised in the public consultation and in the impact assessment.  I have grouped these under the three headings we were familiar with from the last CAP reform.  There certainly will be economic issues.  Here I would expect discussion on measures to help farmers better manage price and market volatility, to strengthen the competitiveness of EU agriculture and to improve the position of farmers in the food chain.  The Commissioner has promised to try to persuade his colleagues, particularly in the Directorate General for Competition, to come forward with proposals on that issue, but it might well be wrapped into a more general reform of the CAP.<\/p> <p>  We then have the environmental heading, which of course was a key change in the last CAP reform with the introduction of the greening payment.  There is quite a discussion as to whether this has been an effective instrument to achieve environmental improvement and we will see some discussion on that.  We will also see the importance of the climate agenda, both in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and perhaps in looking at the role of agriculture in terms of sequestering carbon and contributing to renewable energy.<\/p> <p>  Then you have the social dimension, where we will see a focus on young farmers, generational renewal and more broadly, as part of the Juncker priorities, the creation of jobs and economic growth in rural areas.  It will be a very broad-ranging public consultation and it will raise all the issues followed very closely by many members in the last CAP reform.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight some of the changes in the political context.  The first is that, since the last reform, the EU has signed up to the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs, and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which includes climate.  The Paris climate agreement can be seen as the first step in implementing the climate goal in those SDGs.  The Commission is taking this very seriously.  In the last reform we were trying to fit the CAP into the Europe 2020 strategy, which was the overarching strategy of the time.  I think for 2030 it is very much these sustainable development goals.  That will mean more emphasis on environmental issues than we have seen in the past.  There is a concern, not least in the light of Brexit, to try to show that whatever the EU is doing contributes to EU added value and that it is not trying to replace activities and policies which member states themselves could better implement.  It is a question of whether it is possible to demonstrate that what we do in agriculture is contributing to European added value and is not simply substituting for what member states do. <\/p> <p> The Commissioner has made simplifying the CAP his main objective in his term of office.  It is extremely difficult, because agriculture and land management is complicated.  The committee is aware of that.  We can have different views as to how successful simplification has been but it is certainly going to be a recurring motive in the next reform.<\/p> <p>  Then of course the fourth issue, which we have already touched on, is the budget and how much money may be available. <\/p> <p>  The final part of the statement was really just to draw the attention of the committee to a report which I had prepared for the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  It is one of three reports.  The other two looked at the Common Market organisations and at rural development.<\/p><p> I was asked to talk about the future of direct payments.  I summarised some of the conclusions from that report, which was designed and help the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to identify some of the key issues.  We can take it from a rather conservative position, one where we roll over the existing CAP structure with its two pillars, the greening payment and the direct payments, and even there I think we will see a number of issues which were quite contentious on the previous occasion.  These issues include the external convergence, which is the expectation of the newer member states that their payments will continue to increase up to the average level.  This has implications for the internal convergence, which is the question as to whether we should have a uniform payment across all farms.  This was very contentious in Ireland in the last reform.  There was a link made between the internal convergence formula and the external convergence formula, so if one is changed in the next reform, we might expect the other to be changed.  The question was asked whether the capping of payments, which really has had no serious impact, will be reviewed?  Even taking a very conservative view, there are some quite contentious issues which I think will be addressed.<\/p><p> There are those who would like to go further.  Some people point to what has been happening in the United States.  In their last farm bill they actually eliminated direct payments.  They were the first to introduce them, but they eliminated them and decided instead to put the money into what they call their farm safety net.  This comprises two main policies.  One is counter-cyclical price support and the other is crop insurance, which despite its name actually covers some livestock products too.  I would not recommend taking the route of counter-cyclical payments.  We could discuss whether that is a good idea or not.  In terms of the broader issue of risk management and insurance, it is worth looking at whether that has the potential to help farmers to manage risk better.  I am a little bit sceptical.  I think that farmers prefer to self insure, to use their savings or to draw on bank credit and tax averaging schemes to manage variability.  There may well be a role for strengthening risk management instruments.  The Commission has emphasised in particular this income stabilisation tool, so maybe that is something which should be further pursued.<\/p><p> Some of the committee members may not be surprised to hear me say that, although I am extremely aware of the fact that direct payments are very important to many farmers, I have never been a great fan of them.  Looking at it partly from a taxpayer point of view but also from a farmer's point of view, I find it hard to justify paying a decoupled area-based payment per hectare of land without any evidence of return.  I realise it will be controversial, but I have suggested that we would be better off, in a sense, taking some of that money and putting it into more targeted payments where we set out some objectives we want to achieve.  These could be environmental objectives, risk management objectives, improving competitiveness or helping farmers address the climate challenge.  It is to have more targeted payments rather than these generalised area-based supports which benefit the larger farmers within the Union because it is paid on a per hectare basis, and the more hectares one has, the more support one gets.  At the end of the statement I summarise some of the principles which I recognise would be quite controversial, but perhaps I will leave it at that, and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the professor.

On the last points made by the professor, certainly for many farmers in Ireland, the intensification of agriculture has meant that fewer farmers are farming the land.  I have always felt that the Irish model, and to some extent the British model, where there is the family farm and livestock are free to roam and are grass fed, is unique.  We have those advantages.  I feel that in terms of an EU agricultural policy, every effort should be made to protect and enhance that, because it is a key thing.  It is also what European consumers want.  Whatever reform emerges should be focused on ensuring that emphasis is put on the smaller holdings, the family farm and that type of production unit.<\/p> <p>  I understand what Professor Matthews is saying regarding payments per hectare.  It is hard to envisage anything that will work for the farmer that is not a payment per hectare.  That is the problem we have.  It would be interesting to tease that out.  I understand that in CAP there is the environmental sector, the greening measures and all that stuff, which many farmers avail of.  However, many farmers also find that the red tape that comes into it can cause a huge degree of frustration for them, because they feel they have to jump through many hoops to get a relatively small amount of money.  Certainly where I come from, it pushes them into a position where they end up abandoning the farm, planting the land and stopping working it.  It is a tragedy, because it is a permanent change of land use, and it means that that land will never be used for productive farming again, and there will never be a community living in that area again, because it is such a low labour intensive form of production.  If CAP reform is to work from an Irish perspective, it has to be about delivering the maximum payments to the family farm and the farmer who is on the most marginal land.  If we are going to try to do that, I would be interested in hearing the views of Professor Kelly as to how an alternative to hectare-based payments might work, because he said if it was not on a hectare basis, it could be more targeted.  If it could work, I would hope that it would give the Irish farmer an advantage which he or she does not have at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#L00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his presentation.  I have crossed swords with him before regarding his views on the single payment, and it will be no different on this occasion.  This is the biggest challenge in terms of direct payments that we have faced as a country since the introduction of the MacSharry reforms.  I would like to make a number of observations.  We talk about what benefit it has for the country, but European consumers are paying less and less as a percentage of their disposable income for the food they consume.  That is a serious issue that we have as European farmers.  The reality is, without the single farm payment, the vast majority of our farmers would not be able to survive.  With regard to farmers on marginal land, the truth is that all farmers are under pressure.  There has to be some recognition in this reform of farmers who are earning their income from full-time farming.<\/p><p>We have a significant number of farmers who can survive without an off-farm income, but those who are farming full time will have to be recognised this time around.  One can introduce and operate caps, but if there is not some recognition of off-farm income, it will be extremely unfair.  That is something that has been overlooked when we have talked about caps and targeting payments at different areas.  The full-time farmer will have to be recognised more in this reform.<\/p><p> I would like to ask Professor Matthews a number of questions about his view of various aspects of the arguments that will be made in the next few months.  The cornerstone is that it is an historic payment dating back to the period 2000 to 2002.  Will it be able to survive this round of negotiations?  Should it survive?  A lot of people who have entered the industry engage in completely different farming practices.  That is a fundamental point and it is where we are starting from.<\/p><p> There is an ongoing review of areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments and how the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is to be protected.  Will it be protected and what percentage of the budget will be devoted to it?  It is a hugely significant payment for this country.  Virtually three quarters of our land is in areas of natural constraint.  What impact will the review have?  <\/p><p> I seek the professor's view on a matter related to the budget.  Some 38% of the EU budget is devoted to agriculture in the form of the CAP.  However, with the British decision to leave the European Union and a European Parliament that does not have a friendly disposition towards the CAP, what is the professor's realistic expectation of the percentage that will be spent on the CAP following the review?  Considering the external convergence from eastern European and the internal convergence at home, will there be virtual parity per hectare when the negotiations are concluded in 2020?  What will be the economic consequences for the country?<\/p><p> I would like the professor to expand a little more on a point that was made in an earlier contribution.  He criticised the changes made by the United States of America in eliminating farm payments, but he believes what has been introduced will not work in the medium to long term.  As what happens in the United States has a habit of happening here half a decade later, I would like the professor to expand on why he thinks what has been done in the United States is not in the best interests of the industry there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#L00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his presentation and insights.

As pointed out by Deputies Jackie Cahill and Gino Kenny, a significant proportion of income, or almost all for farmers involved in some sectors, comes from farm payments.  Therefore, the stakes are very high in terms of how much will be included in the budget and how it will be distributed.  Unless it is maintained to a significant extent, it will sound the death knell for a number of family farms.  It is crucial, therefore, that we achieve a good outcome.

I thank the Deputies for their questions.  I will make a preliminary statement.<\/p> <p>  Given that the direct payments are so important, particularly for beef and cereal farmers, I certainly hope changes would not take place overnight such that we would be thinking of what happened in New Zealand, for example.  I will come back to Deputy Jackie Cahill's point about direct payments being the cornerstone of the MacSharry reforms, but it is hard to continue to find justification for direct payments.  It would be better to plan for that change and try to look at what we might want to see put in place, rather than put our heads in the sand and simply say we have clearly benefited from these benefits in the past and want to hold onto them because clearly we do not want to give them up.  I can completely understand this.  I think we need to take into account the budgetary context.  This is the first question that has been raised about what the impact might be on the budget, but I would not like to put a figure on it.  I believe, however, that the budget will be smaller simply because I see the European Union being concerned about the other challenges of migration, security and, to some extent, job creation, although it can be argued that agriculture and the food industry will play a role in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The European Commission will come forward by the end of this year with its initial proposals in respect of the next multi-annual financial framework.  Some voices argue that it should be brought forward sooner because if Brexit takes place in 2019, perhaps we will need a revised financial framework as and from 2020 rather than, as we now expect, 2021.  There are suggestions we should simply roll over the existing medium-term budget because of the timing problem, with European Parliament elections due to take place in 2019.  It may well be difficult to get it through before it breaks up.<\/p> <p>  People see value in the maintenance of the family farm and smaller farms.  Recognising this, if we can try to quantify or identify that value, can we support the activities engaged in rather than the size of the farm?  I am not a great fan of supporting farms simply because they are small.  I think Deputy Jackie Cahill is absolutely right in that regard.  Small farms differ enormously in terms of their income and many farmers have an outside income.  That is one of the reasons I do not think capping direct payments would provide for greater equity because the income position of such farms is very different.  Because they are small and less intensive, can we actually make payments to support their involvement in more extensive farming?  I would see this as a targeted payment.  I am not worried if a farm is small or large.  If a farmer is farming more extensively and producing more - it could be bio-energy if engaged in forestry - that is something the public can recognise and would be willing to support, as opposed to giving him or her a payment per hectare without requiring a return, although I know that there are cross-compliance conditions attached.<\/p><p> There is not really any evident return to the taxpayer from that per-hectare payment.  If the farmer is involved in a short supply chain, supplying the local farmers' market, for example, and we could support that directly, not the fact that the farmer is small but that he or she is doing something the consumer wants, I would see a value for payments.  That is why I am a great supporter of the Pillar 2, which provides us with a framework.  I would like to see it enlarged and strengthened because it gives us more flexibility to provide these targeted payments.  I understand the reluctance to see land moving out of farming into forestry, which is probably the most likely land use but we do have a policy objective to increase the rate of planting.  It has a role in helping us meet our climate targets.  The planting carried out now is more environmentally sensitive than was the case in the past when there were acres of conifers.  I can completely understand why people objected to that.  I have walked in the forests of Denmark, which date from the 19th century when there was a replanting scheme.  The German forests also date largely from the 19th century.  They are replanted forests.  I look forward to the day when we could have a larger forest stock.  I realise there are different views on that but I am more positively inclined to see it as an option.<\/p><p> The key point is in the question about the decoupled payments.  They were not initially decoupled, they were partially coupled under the MacSharry reform and were decoupled a decade later under the Fischler reform.  They were introduced to compensate for that price reduction.  We need to rethink the basis on which we are asking the taxpayer to continue to provide that transfer to farmers.  We are maintaining land and landscape in difficult farming areas.  I have absolutely no problem in supporting payments for areas under natural constraint.  We are doing things for the environment, protecting biodiversity, habitats and so on, which is absolutely a clear case for support.  That is the direction I would like to encourage people to think about moving.  It will be more difficult to maintain the area payments.  That is not to say that farm groups will not fight to do that.<\/p><p> Earlier, we discussed what UK agricultural policy might look like after Brexit.  It will be interesting if the UK follows through on what many of us felt was likely to be the case, it is going to be an interesting case study to put it mildly, how farmers respond in a situation with lower support.  There is a case that at least a fair proportion of the direct payments leak out of the sector.  There is no doubt that conacre rents and the price of rented land are higher because people know there are direct payments they can access.  I am pretty sure input costs are higher than they would be if we did not have the direct payments.  There are ways in which the agricultural sector would automatically adjust to lower payments over time and given the space and time to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The advent of mega-cities is causing a migration problem - for example, in Dublin.  I am from Mayo where, like Donegal and Sligo, the statistics show migration of people to the cities.  In developed countries where the concept of the family farm has been lost, there are ranches and loss of population.  In developing countries there is no regard for the farmer.  I know there are issues for the farmer as producer, the price he gets in the food supply chain and the problems we have here.  Much of the money given out in direct payments does not satisfy people.  It just keeps them ticking along.  We need to consider, in the larger global context, how to have viable communities in rural areas because people in such areas do not really want handouts.  We always suffer from the problem of critical mass and it becomes part of a vicious circle.  We lose more people and then we must ask whether it is worth investing in areas such as those to which I refer.  There are many opportunities but support is required or else we will continue giving crumbs to farmers.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about rural development.  As a country that has strong rural traditions, we could develop some formula that could be applied elsewhere because the massive loss to rural areas is a worldwide issue.  Do we value them?  People cannot live on fresh air and the CAP is intended to secure food supplies - there are also environmental concerns - but do we want more than that for rural areas where people do not want handouts?  This is a much bigger question than just tinkering around with cuts here and there.  For individuals on low incomes, those making no money apart from what they receive from direct payments or individuals who are losing money as a result of the price of commodities, a small cut per week is a major issue.  We have a golden opportunity to try to arrive at a formula.  I do not know if there is an appetite to do so, however.  I can only see it going in the same direction.  It will be more depressing to be a farmer.  We will lose young people, a way of life and food quality and all our great ambitions will be dashed.<\/p> <p>  Much of the global political upheaval arises from too much emphasis on economy yet we cannot enjoy many of the pleasures, the leisure and lifestyle we have without economy but somehow people think we are bowing at the altar of our being economic units and we do not get the balance right.  The CAP could provide an opportunity to inquire as to what is our vision for rural Ireland and to do something right in respect of it, rather than just giving people crumbs to keep them going until the next crisis.  We seem to be always playing catch-up.  We could do more and do something for our country, respect the cities and the rural areas.  We need to take the pressure off the cities.  They cannot cope.

The opening point of CAP reform is not always where the end point is.  We saw during the most recent CAP reform that the then Commissioner had very radical proposals but that the eventual outcome was totally different.  We must bear that in mind.  In addition, the main difference on this occasion will be the budget.  It will determine exactly where we will go.  Perhaps my observation is wrong but, in my opinion, the budget will probably be an indication of where we will go in future CAP reforms, even beyond the current one.  There is continuous downward pressure on the budget.  Professor Matthews made a point earlier about the condition of farmers in this country, what is coming down the line and the decrease in funding available.  This may have a knock-on effect in a positive way.  For example, as Professor Matthews rightly mentioned, the price of conacre, fertilisers and inputs is a huge issue in this country.  There is no doubt that conacre has got out of control in recent years, possibly as a result of the cheque in the post that will come sooner rather than later.

I will respond first to the question on the US policy and why I was not too enthusiastic, particularly about its countercyclical payment aspect.  This is for a number of reasons.  First, it would be a step back to relating support directly to production, from which we moved away.  It would require support again to be linked to products.  There would certainly be difficulties in fitting it into the EU budget structure, which, as we know, is rather inflexible because it is set for seven years, although there are ways of moving money between headings.  It is not an easy structure in which to try to manage a countercyclical payment policy whereby one will, by definition, have a large expenditure in one or two years when prices are quite low and, when prices go back up again, zero expenditure.  Managing that countercyclical payment in the context of a relatively inflexible EU budget would be a challenge.  Furthermore, prices fluctuate because they are a signal indicating that farmers and consumers need to adjust.  If prices go down, it means there is oversupply, and if we prevent that signal going to farmers by telling them they will get this guaranteed price in any case, we will simply shift the adjustment onto the rest of the world.  There is an aspect here of our interest in developing countries which, I feel, also argues against countercyclical policies.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of the farm safety net is, as I said, risk management, that is, helping farmers to manage risk.  One of the issues on which we have some evidence here is that because in the past European agricultural policy provided much of this risk management through the market mechanisms - variable import levies, export subsidies, intervention, support and so on - it meant that private initiatives never developed to the same extent as they did in other countries, simply because we had these public support mechanisms in place.  In the academic literature we refer to this as the public mechanisms crowding out the private initiatives.  When the public mechanisms were slowly withdrawn, and as we became more market-oriented in our Common Market mechanisms, we were slow to see the emergence of private replacements.  It is only this year, or perhaps last, in the dairy industry that co-ops are offering fixed-price contracts to farmers.  This should have happened years ago as a way of sharing a risk.  There are opportunities to try to consider more private initiatives, perhaps with the support of some public funding.  As I said, I am still not fully convinced farmers will see this as a really attractive option in terms of buying insurance to stabilise their incomes.  As I said earlier, they may prefer to continue to do this on an individual basis, but I am certainly open to the idea that we should put more effort into considering this through pilot schemes and trying to assess the appetite of farmers for enrolling in these kinds of income stabilisation measures.  We could consider that part of the American system.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, the decoupled payments were a great improvement on what went before, and I am certainly not arguing that we should move back to the past.  However, the next step is to try to argue that there is a case for making transfers to farmers, that they do provide services other than food and that they should be rewarded for this.  It is a question of trying to see how we can target the payments.  That is really the message I am trying to get across.<\/p> <p>  The issue relating to beef is difficult.  People refer to the suckler cow herd as the national asset.  I have difficulty seeing this as the case.  It is clear that we will continue to produce beef and that we will have a dairy herd and beef coming from that herd.  The suckler herd is one of the few options for farmers in more marginal areas.  It is not a very efficient system, as we know.  I worry about the argument that to break even and give oneself a margin of &euro;200 per cow, we need a price of &euro;4.75 per kilo for beef, which is equivalent to almost another subsidy of &euro;200 per cow, which I see some people seeking, when the industry is already surviving simply on the basis of the payments.  Therefore, to say that the future of the industry is to give another &euro;200-per-cow subsidy is simply not the way forward.  I am an economist, not a livestock expert.  However, I am of the view that we probably need to go back and consider more extensive systems, which probably means larger farms - larger not necessarily in terms of economic size, but in terms of area - if our stocking rates are lower, and lower-cost systems.  I do not see us getting a market price of &euro;4.75 in the near future - not with Brexit and the way markets are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Surely, however, markets go against low-cost systems.

As the committee is well aware, this discussion is not simply about numbers.  More importantly, it is about the provision of funding to deliver vital public services for our citizens and to invest in infrastructure.  These services are delivered by over 300,000 public servants working in a number of Government Departments and agencies, a total of 41 separate Votes which are subject to approval by the D&aacute;il.  My last engagement with the committee was prior to the publication of the 2017 Estimates and I thank it for its valued contribution to that process.  Since budget time, there have been a number of developments which I will outline to give a brief sense of the scale and changes made to the funding of services.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure report of 2017, which was published at budget time, revised the projected total gross voted expenditure for 2016 to &euro;56.149 billion, which was an increase of &euro;310 million or 0.6%.  This reflected additional capital expenditure which was outlined in the mid-year expenditure report and provision for a social welfare Christmas bonus less anticipated offsetting savings across Government Departments.  These additional expenditure amounts were reflected in the Supplementary Estimates that were considered and agreed by the D&aacute;il in December.  We operate a cash-based accounting system and, as the committee will appreciate, given the scale of resources involved, which was some &euro;56 billion in 2016, there are timing and other budget management issues that mean it is difficult to be precise about the final spending position.  So for 2016, the actual gross voted expenditure outturn is reflected in the end of December Exchequer returns, which is &euro;55.981 billion. This is 0.6% lower than the gross expenditure allocation including Supplementary Estimates and is a very minor variation and very similar to previous years.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to 2017.  The 2017 Revised Estimates proposes total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58.07 billion, which is an increase of &euro;43 million, or 0.07%, over the amount set out in the expenditure report of 2017.  This increase reflects a number of post-budget technical and policy adjustments.  The increase in the 2017 Estimate over the 2016 Estimate, including Supplementary Estimates, is &euro;1.7 billion, or 3.1%.  When the 2017 Estimate is compared with the 2016 outturn the increase is &euro;2.1 billion, or 3.7%.<\/p><p> Last October, I announced a spending review, which will take place in advance of budget 2018.  While moderate, sustainable expenditure growth is now planned over the medium term, there are increasing and competing public service demands emerging.  The intention is that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options within the budgetary process by creating fiscal space for funding new policies from within existing ceilings through a systematic review of the existing cost base.  In parallel with this process, my Department is continuing its works on planning the capital review, the outcome of which is expected to be published alongside the 2017 mid-year expenditure report.  The objective of the capital review will be to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and what can realistically be delivered over the remainder of the plan utilising the additional resources now available.<\/p><p> I want to mention the measure announced by Government today to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement following the Labour Court recommendations on Garda pay.  After discussions with union leaders, I recommended an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period 1 April 2017 to the end of August 2017, inclusive, for those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000, those who are parties to the Lansdowne Road agreement, and those who do not stand to benefit from the Labour Court recommendations issued in respect of the Garda associations.<\/p><p> The Government believes in the value of collective agreements and is taking steps to support the continued implementation of the Lansdowne Road agreement until a successor agreement can be negotiated following the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  A collective approach to public service pay is vital to our national interest as it provides for the stable industrial relations environment, which has been a pillar of our domestic recovery and restored international reputation.  These agreements deliver public service reform, secure productivity improvements and allow for strong fiscal planning where pay increases are negotiated fairly and budgeted for on a multi-annual basis.  This allows us to balance pay increases in the public service with other social priorities, including improvements in housing and health care.  Collective agreements, however, are not dead documents or static bargains, they have to be flexible and responsive to events.  <\/p><p> The Labour Court recommendation with respect to Garda pay provided for pay increases for a particular group of public servants.  The Government had to act to ensure that the benefits of a collective approach were not undermined and that the Lansdowne Road agreement remains in place.<\/p><p> In my opening statement I have outlined the expenditure outturn position for 2016, the Estimates position for 2017 and the Government's announcement to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement, which has a continuing key role to play in underpinning the continued sustainability of our public finances.  I have also summarised my Department's plans for the spending review and made reference to the capital review planning for 2017.  I look forward to working with all the members of the committee this year and would welcome their input into and questions on any of the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#C00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I apologise in advance for having to leave early as I have another commitment at 5 p.m.  I will start where the Minister finished on the issue of public service pay.  He made an announcement this morning of &euro;120 million of extra expenditure and immediately prior to Christmas, there was &euro;50 million expenditure for the Garda deal.  There are a few questions around that.  That &euro;50 million was split between &euro;25 million from the budget of the Department of Justice and Equality and &euro;25 million from the general budget.  Will the same formula apply across all Departments for the &euro;120 million extra expenditure that was announced this morning?  Can the Minister give a guarantee that services will not be affected in any way by the Garda expenditure allocation or the extra expenditure allocation announced this morning?  Is the &euro;120 million announced this morning included Revised Estimates for 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that \"pay increases are negotiated fairly and budgeted for on a multi-annual basis\" in relation to Lansdowne Road and we all agree with that, but what we have had in the past few months have been pay agreements on the hoof, to a certain extent, and since the introduction of the budget he has managed to find &euro;170 million effectively out of nowhere.  He said in his press conference that it will be found from general savings and efficiencies.  That is one very big sofa if it has &euro;170 million down the back of it.<\/p> <p>  The role of this committee is budget scrutiny and if &euro;170 million can be found on the hoof, that makes our job as a committee very difficult.  An independent budget office, the putting in place of which is our aim and which will be established this year, will surely not approve of that kind of action.  The Minister will not be able to do that under the new fiscal rules.  How will this or any Government envisage that kind of expenditure in light of the new fiscal rules environment and in light of us being empowered and able to do the job the Oireachtas has given us as a scrutiny committee?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister outline the process and timelines for the capital review and the spending review?  Before the Minister arrived, Deputy Cullinane proposed that we would do some work on the fiscal rules around capital expenditure.  Given the commitments the Minister has entered into and the spending commitments in the budget and subsequent to it, what will be the revised fiscal space, to use those dreaded words, for 2017, 2018 and 2019?  In the context of the Minister going down the road of having a capital review, where is the space within the existing fiscal rules for us to have an active and aggressive capital investment programme, which we all agree we need?  Given that those rules are so restrictive, has the Minister engaged with the European Commission around those rules?  Has he responded to their entreaties?  President Juncker and others have said that there needs to be flexibility?  Has Ireland engaged in that process of flexibility around capital expenditure?  We saw the director general of the HSE at the weekend look for an extra &euro;9 billion in capital expenditure for the health service.  I am sure if every other director general and Secretary General had the opportunity, they would be doing something similar.  <\/p> <p>  What is the Minister's expectation for the comprehensive spending review?  His predecessor would have completed that probably on two or three different occasions during his time in the Department or one would have hoped he would have.  In the context of the expenditure cuts that were engaged in during that time, one would assume that every cent was accounted for.  The Minister made the suggestion in his opening statement that he hopes out of the spending review to find additional resources for spending and for programmes, and to add to the fiscal space.  That is what I understood him to say.  Can he outline the timeline for the spending review and what kind of figure he has in mind that may be achieved from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#D00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will begin by responding to his questions on the spending review and I will conclude by answering his question on public service pay.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comprehensive spending review and the capital review, the process for each of them will be different.  In terms of the comprehensive spending review, we will identify a portion of Government expenditure by Government Department.  We anticipate it will be approximately one third of Government expenditure but we will pick that percentage of Government expenditure so that it is consistent with subheadings within that Department's Vote.  We will then review that expenditure against a different approach from what my predecessor would have done.  When Deputy Howlin was performing this role, he looked for cuts in the context of our being in the troika programme.  We have not commenced a process like this since the run-up to, or during, the crisis.  The objective of this approach is to examine efficiencies.  It will be to examine what objectives are set for an expenditure stream and to see how that expenditure stream delivers against those objectives.  It will be a rolling process that we anticipate will cover all of Government expenditure over a three-year period.  Any conclusions we have with respect to that third of Government expenditure that we cover in 2018 will be concluded in advance of budget 2018.  There will be a different process for the capital review.  I want to bring all that to a conclusion this year.  In line with the publication of the mid-term expenditure report, we will provide an overview of all current plans - capital expenditure programmes.<\/p><p>We will make an assessment of how much of the existing fiscal space remains unallocated and how much could be allocated for capital expenditure.  Even within the current framework we anticipate it will be approximately &euro;2.2 billion up to 2020 or 2021.  We will then make a choice in the second half of this year in respect of where that will go.<\/p><p> In parallel, it is my anticipation and hope that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, will complete his work on the national planning framework.  I hope that in the second half of the year his work will inform capital choices that we will make, especially in the area of transport and housing.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the fiscal space and the flexibility or lack thereof in respect of capital expenditure.  Under the current framework, assuming no change in our economic circumstances, following the allocation of over &euro;2 billion for housing there still will be between &euro;2 billion and &euro;2.3 billion.  This is based on the assumption of no change in our growth forecasts with regard to allocation against new capital choices.  That is why I want to bring the capital review to a full conclusion in the second half of this year, unlike the comprehensive spending review, which will be an ongoing process.  Then there is the question of flexibility on top of that.  Part of our capital review will include a review of the use of public private partnerships and off-balance-sheet activity to see what role they could play in future capital projects.  As I have said to the committee previously, I am cautious in that area because I have no wish to make an assessment about a particular project being off-balance-sheet only for it to change in two years' time and for the Minister or Government of the day to have to face tough choices regarding projects to which they have already committed.  I expect that in the second half of the year work in that area will be brought to a conclusion.  We are using the funding of housing projects as a pathfinder approach to bring to an end some of the debate on the matter in the European Union.<\/p><p> Reference was made to pay policy.  I do not accept that this is pay policy on the hoof.  If I was sitting before the committee in the second half of this year with the Lansdowne Road agreement disintegrating and sectoral disputes in full flow, the committee would justifiably be asking me why I did not take action at the start of this year to try to give the Government and the State the ability to ensure those things did not happen.  That is what I have done.  I have concluded negotiations with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The conclusion was issued today.  It makes the strongest possible commitment to the maintenance of industrial order for the remaining tenure of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  That is why I believe this is the right decision.  I believe that if we did otherwise not only would we face even more precarious prospects in the second half of this year, but we would either not be able to deliver a replacement to the Lansdowne Road agreement or, if we did negotiate an agreement, it would be dramatically more expensive and potentially unaffordable to the State.  That is why I have put this framework in place.<\/p><p> There was a question about identifying the funding to pay for it and reference was made to the work the committee will need to do to this year.  That is work I will need to do during this year.  I am confident in this regard.  Last year, I identified savings and efficiencies of &euro;168 million on top of maintaining service commitments for 2016.  That is what I intend to do for 2017 as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#D00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I wish to pick up on the Minister's response to Deputy Calleary on public sector pay.  This is not about the rights and wrongs of any policy choice made by a Minister; it is about respect for this committee, in the first instance, and a recognition on the part of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and, hopefully, the Minister for Finance, that we have work to do.  This is a new committee.  Our job is to scrutinise spending and decisions made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government.  Notwithstanding the rights and wrongs of the decision, &euro;120 million is a great deal of money; it is not small change.  The Minister says this can be achieved through efficiencies.  The Minister has a responsibility to come before the committee and explain to us what exactly is meant by that.  I imagine the Minister has been presented with papers by his officials on background information around how exactly that money can be saved and exactly what efficiencies he is talking about and in which Departments.  Is it across all Departments?  We have a right to that information and those papers.  If we are to be in a position to hold the Minister to account properly on the one hand and to help and assist on the other, then we must have the information promised to be able to scrutinise properly.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to &euro;120 million and said the saving can be achieved through efficiencies.  That is a cause of concern for me and possibly for others on this committee.  I am respectfully asking that any background information provided to the Minister with regard to how this money can be achieved is also given to us.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might also explain why the issue of equal work for equal pay was not dealt with.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned the need for industrial relations harmony and holding the line on the Lansdowne Road agreement and so on.  He will understand that at the heart of many industrial relations disputes in recent times has been the core issue of equal work for equal pay.  This relates to those who came into the system post 2011.  We have consistently asked the Minister and the Department to indicate how much it would cost to return to a single-tier pay structure to deal with this issue.  The Minister has been unable to provide us with the figures.  He has been unable to sign up to the principle of it or even give an indication that he will do it over a reasonable timeframe.  Again, I am wondering why this issue was put on the long finger.  It has caused tensions in classrooms, Garda stations and all manner of public sector workplaces because there is a two-tier parallel pay structure in place.  Why was that not considered when the Minister was examining the Lansdowne Road agreement?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to capital spend.  At the weekend an opinion piece by the director general of the HSE referred to the need for &euro;9 billion of increased capital spend in health care in hospitals.  The Cassells report refers to the need for billions more in capital spend.  We have a housing emergency.  Obviously, we need to build more houses and we need a great deal more capital spend on housing.  I do not see anything in what the Minister has said today to suggest there is any urgency from the Government when it comes to investing in these areas.  The Minister commented on how this was not about numbers but about people and services.  However, the Minister said as much against the backdrop of people in hospital trolleys in record numbers, a dire need to invest in our schools and third and fourth level infrastructure and the need for the State to build housing.  How does the Minister expect to be able to meet the capital demands that exist without more flexibility?  How we can do that and continue with the tax-cutting agenda that he started in the last budget on top of previous budgets?  I cannot see how the Minister can square the two.  When representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council were before the committee, they said the only way we could do it in reality was to increase taxes on those who perhaps can afford to pay more, where possible.  Obviously, the Minister is not in favour of that.  His party has set its face against it and is in favour of cutting taxes.  How is that possible in the face of what we now seeing with regard to housing, health care and other areas?  I have a supplementary question that I will put when the Minister responds, but I will take the Minister's responses first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There was a question on health expenditure.  By this year we will be spending &euro;3,200 per head on health expenditure.  This is a 5.4% increase above our highest ever point before that in 2009.  Not only is health expenditure at its highest ever level; in <i>per capita<\/i>terms it is higher than where we have been before.  At &euro;14.1 billion, the allocation is the highest that has ever been made to the health sector.  Where is that figure going?  It is delivering a 10% increase in the number of people employed in the health service compared with where we were during the crisis period.<\/p><p>Those are the figures in regard to what is happening with health expenditure.  It is the highest in terms of gross expenditure and the highest in terms of <i>per capita<\/i>expenditure, which I believe is a more appropriate way to measure these matters here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In regard to how we are looking to deal with capital expenditure, the Deputy is correct about the array of competing demands.  There is a whole array of agencies, stakeholders and interests across the country that are looking for additional capital expenditure.  The Deputy mentioned two of them and I mentioned the HSE.  In regard to housing, we have allocated an additional &euro;2 billion in health expenditure.  He did not touch on transport, on arts and heritage, on sport or on all the other areas that are competing for this funding.  The reason we are putting in place a capital review is to look at what choices we can make to expand capital expenditure and, within all that, see who would be the beneficiaries of it.<br\/><br\/>What I would say is different to what the Deputy has said is that, first, we need to pay for everything we commit to and, second, I believe we should move away from the approach of comparing the cash amount we are putting against capital expenditure with where we were at the peak, and instead look at what we want to get in return for it.  The capital plan we have outlined up to 2021-22 looks to increase capital expenditure as a percentage of national income up to 3.8% to 4% of national income, which is in line with the 50-year average for the country and in line with where many of our peer economies are at the moment.<br\/><br\/>In regard to public sector pay, the Deputy said it is not about the rights and wrongs of policies.  What it is about is making what are difficult choices that are not without risk, and trying to make a choice that gives the best possible prospect for us for 2017.  That is what I have done and why I am here today to be accountable to the committee, as I will be.  In all my considerations, at no point was I looking to be disrespectful to the Oireachtas or the committee.  I believe it was appropriate that we made a decision at the start of this year.  Across this year, through the various tools that are available to me, I will do everything possible to ensure the funding is put in place to do this while delivering against the other commitments we have.<br\/><br\/>I agree that &euro;120 million is a very significant amount.  Alongside that, however, it is 0.2% of what we have allocated for all expenditure within the State.  What I have judged would pose an even greater challenge to public service delivery in the second half of this year is the disintegration of a collective approach to public pay.  That is why I made the recommendation that was accepted by Cabinet.  While the Deputy is pointing to the difficulties, in the interests of balance we should make reference to the statement that was issued by ICTU today and the commitment it has made to the maintenance of the Lansdowne Road agreement.<br\/><br\/>In regard to equal work for equal pay, we will be looking to address such matters in the context of the Lansdowne Road agreement and what will replace it.  We will begin work on that, I hope, in the second half of this year.  I have two concluding points in this regard.  First, workplaces all over the country have employees who have different terms and conditions and different levels of salary, depending on the point at which they joined that workplace and the health and financial viability of their employer.  To make a big change in that regard is something that will have consequences for everybody else who joined the public service, not just teachers.  The only way the Government can deal with such a matter is in the collective approach to public pay that I am trying to maintain.  I would hope the Deputy also recognises the agreement we did make with the INTO and the TUI that made progress in dealing with the issue of new entrant pay for teachers, and was recognised as such by the INTO and the TUI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#E00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I have a small number of supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to be brief.

When I made my point that this was not about the rights and wrongs of his decision, I meant that sincerely.  My point was that, in terms of process, he has made an announcement that he can achieve &euro;120 million in efficiencies.  The first question is why that was not identified at budget time.  What people will reasonably ask is, if these efficiencies can be made, why were they not found earlier.  The Minister has a responsibility to not just say in broad, bland, general terms that we have found &euro;120 million.  I cannot explain to anybody outside this room exactly where 1 cent of that will be saved because the Minister has given us no information whatsoever.  We are the budgetary scrutiny committee yet I have not one scrap of paper in front of me which tells me where that &euro;120 million will be found.  That is the reality and it is the point I am making.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the capital spend, again, I do not think the Minister has addressed the point.  He said earlier that he and the Government are looking at the review of public-private partnerships and the possibility of more off-balance sheet options.  That is a tacit acceptance the fiscal rules are not working.  If we have to look at these types of mechanisms, and we have seen how they have backfired on the Government with Irish Water, I do not think it is the way to go.  To me, it is a recognition that these mechanisms have not worked.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made the point that this was not about comparing cash amounts and I have heard the Minister for Finance make the point a number of times that we should not focus just on how much we are putting into public services and that it is not about comparing cash amounts.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, makes that point here again today yet, nonetheless, that is exactly what he did in his response to me.  He talked about comparing the amounts of money that were put into the health service in the past when he said there is a record level of investment and so on - he is the one that made that comparison.  I am pointing out to the Minister the reality that whatever he might say about the health service and about how much is being spent, we have problems in regard to capacity.  More patients are being outsourced to private hospitals, there is more agency spend, there are missed targets in regard to people waiting to see consultants within 18 months and there are record levels of patients on hospital trolleys.  That is the reality.  When we have the director general of the HSE saying that &euro;9 billion is necessary over the next ten years, it should be a wake-up call.  I have heard nothing from the Minister to tell me that will be addressed in the short, medium or long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I do not need any encouragement to wake up.

I understand what is going on in different sectors of our health service but, cumulatively, as I said, what we have seen is an increase of just over 10% compared with where we were a number of years ago.  It is due to an understanding of the sectoral challenges that are faced, particularly within our health service, that we made an agreement with representatives of the nursing union in regard to the role of the student credit to try to address some of the issues we are facing in regard to the recruitment and retention of nurses.  We have done that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the specific points the Deputy put to me about capital spending, I have acknowledged the competing demands that exist. That is why I am reviewing the capital programme, despite the fact the programme is in existence less than two years.  I know that the context within which the plan was first founded has now changed, and that is why I am doing this piece of work.  Do I believe the fiscal rules are broken?  No, I do not.  Do I believe we should find ways of giving flexibility to capital expenditure?<\/p><p>The qualification for fiscal space, as the Deputy knows, already does that because it accrues capital expenditure in a different way to current expenditure when it occupies fiscal space.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said he wants to see whether further flexibility can be found on capital expenditure and we are doing work in that regard on housing to see if that can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00900","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I expect he probably had anticipated the backlash he is receiving from Deputies here today.  There is no criticism as such in giving a pay increase to a public sector worker and nobody is disagreeing with that aspect of it.  We, however, have a job to do.  If we go back as far as the budgetary process when we scrutinised Government proposals and put forward our own proposals, certainly all the Opposition parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the others, put forward budget proposals on the basis of figures provided to us on the assumption that they were correct figures and that they were all the figures that were available.  Moments before the budget was announced the Minister, Deputy Donohoe managed to find &euro;100 million.  At the time it was highlighted to him that Deputies were very unhappy with how that was done and we felt it undermined the budgetary process at that point.  Today the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has found another &euro;120 million and not so long ago he managed to find &euro;150 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Nobody is begrudging money going to public servants but the job we have to do as Opposition Deputies on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to put forward realistic alternative budget proposals to the public and to the Minister.  Because we are not operating on the same figures with which the Minister appears to be operating, it makes our job impossible and makes a mockery of the process.  We must take the Minister at face value when he says that he has found this &euro;120 million from savings and efficiencies - which is the term I believe the Minister has used.  As Deputy Cullinane has pointed out we have nothing before us to show where those efficiencies were made and we have nothing before us to tell the committee or the D&aacute;il when the Minister found out about these efficiencies.  When did the Minister become aware that he was going to have an extra &euro;120 million to play with?  On average it is working out at around &euro;4,000 annually to members of the Garda - and again nobody is begrudging that - I understand why it was done.  I appreciate the Minister cannot comment much on this aspect but clearly the difficulties facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the onslaught and threat of an unprecedented all-out strike, the pressure it brought to public sector pay, the whole discourse around that process and all the upset around that HR difficulty have led to increased pressure on the Minister to find money elsewhere for other sectors of the public service.  The Minister is telling us that he found this funding through efficiencies but it appears as though he found the money because he had no other choice.  He tells us that it will not affect other services but there is nothing before the Deputies to assure the committee that this is not going to happen.  The Minister speaks about the money going into the health services, for example, and that there has never been more money spent <i>per capita<\/i>in our health service.  However, the numbers of people on trolleys at Mayo University Hospital this year reached an all-time high - the highest in ten years.  If there is more money <i>per capita<\/i>going into the health service, where is it going?  Clearly it is not being spent on the patient and is not improving the level of service provided to our citizens.  I ask the Minister to take on board the issue of the undermining of the committee's work in the handling of this additional money being found and the lack of information coming forward to this committee to allow it to do its work.  I take the Minister at face value when he says he wants to be accountable to this committee and that he is not looking to be disrespectful in any way but he can appreciate, from our perspective, why there might be anger on this side as to the way things have been handled.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister could comment on a criticism the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has laid at the Minister's door on the trend for using temporary or volatile corporate tax receipts to pay for permanent services.  What are the Minister's views on this and what steps is he taking to reduce the risks associated with that?<\/p><p>My final point is on the pre-budget work done by this committee.  We heard presentations from various stakeholders such as the ESRI, IFAC and many others.  At that point in time - going on the original figures the Minister told us were available in the fiscal space - we were being told by every stakeholder that it was on the upper limits of prudent spending for this State for 2017 and that we were hitting the upper reaches.  Considering that we now have &euro;120 million, another &euro;50 million and then &euro;100 million at budget time, is the Minister concerned that he may have exceeded prudent spending for this year, thereby putting us at risk in our economic performance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#G00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers for her points.  I make a broad point that this illustrates the contradiction and challenge I face as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Everywhere I go I face demands for more public expenditure and frequently, in the same analysis, people then go on to accuse me of breaching fiscal rules and expanding fiscal space.  I must try to reconcile both together.  On the response given to me by the Deputy, which she is entitled to do, it strikes me that if the Lansdowne Road agreement had disintegrated or if a number of my Government colleagues were facing pay claims that all had unpredictable consequences for this year, then I would be facing a very different issue if I was before the committee in the second half of this year.  I will offer some perspective for those who have pointed to and criticised my response to the Labour Court recommendation on the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues.  Those who criticise my response to it were also the people who were calling for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to the Labour Court.  If I, as the Minister, had said the next day that I was not accepting that recommendation, then I would have fatally undermined the work of the Labour Court.  For an employer to not accept the Labour Court's recommendation is one thing but it is another for the employer as Government - which set up the Labour Court - to not accept the recommendation.  In so doing and definitively precipitating an environment in which the garda&iacute; would have withdrawn their services, the next day would have posed a different set of consequences for which I am certain I would have been in front of this committee.  Reference was made to how we are dealing with this issue.  Critics are accusing me of responding to this but they would then criticise me if in the second half of the year I was facing pay claims that were unknowable.  While there are risks with the approach I have taken, and I have acknowledged this, I believe in working with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and bringing clarity to a figure for this year.  It offers me and the Government the best prospect of dealing with the maintenance of industrial relations in the State for this year.  I ask Deputies to consider where we would be across the summer if we were facing a situation where momentum was building in the aftermath of Article 50 being triggered - we have a very difficult situation in Northern Ireland and a responsibility to play our role in helping to respond to that - and a situation in which public expenditure policy was unravelling because we were uncertain about what public pay would look like in the second half of 2017.  I have had to make a set of choices to deal with that.  This is the argument I make to Deputy Chambers about the proposal that was supported in Cabinet today.<\/p> <p>  As I do not want it to be uncertain to the committee, I will clarify one matter.  I do not state that I have identified savings or efficiencies and am not giving the figures to the Deputies.  That is not the case.  I am simply saying that the cost of this proposal is a very large amount of money, as I have acknowledged on a number of occasions, but it is in the context of the public pay bill of &euro;13.5 billion.  Were I to have the unknown that I had in respect to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across every aspect of that &euro;13.5 billion, I would face a massive challenge for expenditure policy for the second half of this year.  I have a process for how we are dealing with the issue and in how we can reconcile funding this expenditure while meeting other commitments.  I am more than happy to come back to the committee during the year to account for this process.<\/p><p> I will end on that note.  What would have posed a bigger risk in the context of delivering all the commitments the Deputy wants me to deliver are, in the context of a &euro;13.5 billion pay bill for the State, sectoral wage claims that will escalate in the second half of this year.  I do not wish that to happen, which is the reason I have been engaged in negotiations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions since early December.  We brought those negotiations to a conclusion very recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I have a follow-up question, and I will be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Did I miss a question from the Deputy on capital expenditure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I do not believe so.

While I take the Deputy's point about the consequences of that for the sustainability of public expenditure, I wish to make two points.  First, part of what put me in the situation I was in was honouring the agreement in the programme for Government and in the supply-and-confidence agreement with the Deputy's party, as I was committed to do.  Second, I am doing all of this in the context of the party I represent, which worked with Deputy Burton's party when she was T&aacute;naiste in the previous Government, continuing its work into this Administration.  We have seen the State's deficit come down from 11% of our national income, which is all we make and sell in our country, to the possibility of eliminating the national deficit within the next 18 months.

I have a few questions.  To return to the issue of Garda pay, I am glad that an agreement was reached.  It would have been incredibly unfortunate for the country if there had been a Garda strike, so it is welcome that an agreement was reached.  However, in the material I saw about the agreement and how the &euro;50 million is to be funded, I recall that &euro;25 million is to come from within the resources of the Department of Justice and Equality.  That struck me as being a fairy tale.  I would be grateful if the Minister would analyse this.  His Department is providing a certain level of support, understandably, out of buoyancy.  In these statements, there is a great deal of revenue buoyancy, which has covered many of the difficulties that the Minister undoubtedly faced.  However, in the context of any type of ordinary counting, will he please explain where &euro;5 million, &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million, &euro;20 million or &euro;25 million will be found for Garda pay from the resources of the Department of Justice and Equality?  To be honest, I do not believe what has been stated.  It is a fairy tale.  To return to the comments made about this committee, the Minister has a difficult job to do.  We have a difficult job as well but we will help each other if we can be on the level about some of the figures.  The Minister is not a magician, but he would need to be one to conjure up an extra &euro;25 million from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I would love to know the justice resources that would give up &euro;25 million.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the general principle of the expenditure reviews.  The history of expenditure reviews worldwide is fraught with difficulty.  There are the big beasts of public spending, which are social welfare, health, education and public service pay.  They account for a vast amount of the total public spend, and a huge proportion of that is money well spent.  I am anxious to know what the Minister means by efficiency and efficiency savings.  Obviously, there are certain areas where progress can be made.  One could try to cut down on fraud and clamp down on the black economy, which I believe is rampant again.  These are areas in respect of which savings definitely can be made.  The Minister's Department rides shotgun on the spending of all other Departments.  It has six years experience of doing this, so the Minister should by now be able to share with the committee, via his officials, where the likely efficiencies will be found.  There is one potential efficiency which I believe should be considered very carefully in the context of the type of economy we have.  I refer to outsourcing.  There are people in the Minister's Department who are very fond of the idea of outsourcing.  We have a Government that is dedicated to rural Ireland, as opposed to Dublin.  It is really quite hostile to Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>My God, that is news to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>It is not the Minister or me and certainly not some other people in this room but, based on reading the newspapers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I was not expecting that charge today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>One could base it on reading the newspapers.  If the Department is going to outsource, I must bring it to the Minister's attention that what is happening with outsourcing is a drift down to minimum wage employment and relatively poor conditions of employment.  The Department of Social Protection, in which I worked, has a huge amount of employment distributed throughout the country.  There are large amounts of such employment in places such as Donegal, Sligo and the north west, as well as in the rest of the country.  I seek reassurance from the Minister that this country-wide employment structure will remain largely intact.  We have seen what happened with the British social welfare system, which is very different from ours, and in the social welfare system in the North.  They have outsourced heavily, and disastrously so.  In case this is one of the bright ideas floating around for those savings, I ask that there not be an agenda around additional outsourcing.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on another area.  The Minister referred to demographics, which are terribly important.  Can he supply the committee with a broad indication of the demographic costs involved?  We know what they are in the context of younger children and a rapidly ageing population.  I do not intend to go into that now but it would be useful for this committee because it is not often understood.<\/p><p>We have this marvellous thing that the Germans do not have, a rising population, a huge population of children but with big costs in health and education as a consequence.  We also have an older population which is living longer, another great thing for the country but there is a pensions crisis.  How is the Department going to approach the pricing of those demographic changes which are both a bonus and a huge pressure on spending?  <\/p><p> In respect of the budget arithmetic, including the change that Deputy Chambers referred to, when a senior official told us an hour before the budget announcement that everything was \"nailed down\" &ndash; I think that was the term - there was a laugh around the committee because as we suspected, all the figures were subject to change.  What plans is the Minister putting into his expenditure proposals and reviews for the cost of Brexit?  The sterling rate in the budget arithmetic was assumed to be around 85 cent.  It has fluctuated quite dramatically since and is falling rapidly.  Many of us recall the mushroom growing firms in Monaghan and the midlands that closed overnight.  It will be necessary for the Government to put a plan in place for Brexit.  Is there a contingency plan?  In a certain sense Brexit will happen very slowly.  Will something be put into the plan?  <\/p><p> We need more figures on the child care initiative due to start in September because the provision for it seems very low for our child population.  It will be only three months of this year but in the context of buoyancy it is changeable.  I would like to know more about that and in fairness to this committee the Minister should give us more information.  <\/p><p> In respect of the health service, while I appreciate that &euro;14.1 billion is the highest figure ever, does the Minister really think the Department and its officials have a grip on spending in the health services in Ireland?  We are yo-yoing around very large changes in the figures in the budget season almost week by week.  In his statement the Minister says correctly &ndash; and I was a member of the Government involved in this &ndash; that the health expenditure went up by &euro;780 million in additional allocations.  That was followed, which has become the practice in the Health Service Executive, HSE, by the most recent statement, that it wants &euro;9 billion over ten years.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten.  I know this included capital but does the Department have a serious take on the finances of the health service?<\/p><p> Many extra managers have been employed recently in the health service.  While I know managers are necessary most people want to see that expressed in extra nurses, doctors, medical services and people with qualifications in that field.  In respect of the queues in accident and emergency departments in many parts of Dublin, and Deputy O'Connell could probably elaborate on this, there are very good services available at pharmacy level which are well positioned to take some of the pressure off people going to accident and emergency departments.  That does not, however, seem to be prioritised in any way.  Some of the quality services available in pharmacies in my constituency, the Minister's and that of Deputy O'Connell are absolutely excellent at providing people with information and reassurance for example, when children have cuts or grazes or adults have relatively minor complaints, such as the start of a cold.  This, together with community-based services, seems to be the way to go yet we do not seem to be over the threshold.  What does the Department do to monitor the health service budget?  I presume the &euro;9 billion has been accepted because nobody from the Department said it did not accept that figure.  Is it right?  Is this the private negotiation?  That is roughly an extra &euro;1 billion per annum.  It is a lot of money unless we have a lot of extra buoyancy.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance told us he was involved in negotiations on the terms of the fiscal rules.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform involved in them because unless we put serious capital investment into the capital region, as well as the rest of the country, we will not do as well as we could from Brexit by companies locating in Dublin?  I think we have a good chance of getting extra jobs out of Brexit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H01000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will begin with health expenditure and then deal with the Deputy's points on pay policy.  I will fully answer the question on staffing because it is important to put this on the record.  In December 2013 there were 8,353 people working in the medical and dental sectors of our health service.  That figure was 9,692 in November 2016, an increase of 16%.  There were 34,169 nurses, there are now 35,795, an increase of 4.8%.  The figure for health and social care professionals, such as social workers and people who work in the community, was 12,400; it is now 15,300.  In management and administration there were 15,500 staff and there are now 16,700, an increase of 7.8%.  For general support staff, who support the running of primary care centres and hospitals, there were 9,786 in December 2013, there are now 9,415, a decrease of 3.8%.  In respect of patient and client care, there were 16,796 in December 2013 and at the end of November 2016 there were 19,874, an increase of 18%.  There were 9,808 more people working in our health and social services in November 2016 than in December 2013, an increase of 10.1%.  To paint a picture of numbers of people working in those services contracting is completely inconsistent with the figures for what has happened over the past three to four years.  Those are the figures.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question do we have a grip on health expenditure, the management of the health Vote probably occupies a fifth of my time.  I engage daily and constructively with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on this.  In respect of whether we have an assessment of this, after many years of difficulty in managing it and the Deputy will be well aware of those difficulties because she was party to some of them, I made an intervention last summer in advance of the health Estimate coming to the House and we absolutely expect that revised figure not to be overspent.  I have the same expectation for this year, in contrast with the terrible difficulties my predecessors have had to face in the management of that Vote.<\/p><p>It is one that justifiably attracts a huge amount of my focus and time, given the anxiety and fear people experience when difficulties arise with regard to delivery of the services.  However, to paint a picture of not being able to recruit or numbers decreasing is not the reality in terms of what is happening in those services.<\/p><p> Before I deal with the Deputy's specific points about where we are with public pay, and I will do my best to answer each of them, I want to again read into the record a section of the text we negotiated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I will paraphrase it to get to this point.  It states that this agreement is being offered by Government on the understanding that there will be continued adherence to the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement and, in particular, its mechanisms to resolve disagreements before they escalate into industrial disputes over the remaining period of the agreement.  It further states that the requirement to adhere to industrial peace will be fully observed in all sectors.  That is a joint statement by the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I need hardly tell the Deputy we were a long way away from that place in December.  I am facing challenges on which she is justifiably questioning me now in terms of how we got to this point but as I have said on a number of occasions, it is my assessment that the challenges I face now are different from the position I would be in if our pay bill became completely unpredictable and uncertain in the second half of this year.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has provided details to her counterpart in the D&aacute;il on the detail of the question Deputy Burton put to me.  I do not have the information with me.  However, I will ensure that the Deputy receives an answer to her query.<\/p><p> In terms of how I will manage to deal with all of this across the entirety of 2017, I am not committing to tax buoyancy at this point.  That is a decision for the Minister for Finance to make but I am making the point that the figure before us is less than the savings we accrued at the end of 2016 in respect of expenditure after I had met all the other commitments I had to meet.  While the Deputy was not party to all of this, I want to make the point that the process was a very difficult one of ensuring we could pass a budget for this year and trying to reconcile all the demands we faced.  What I will not wear, however, is being obliged to negotiate the passage of that budget through the Oireachtas in a way that is consistent with our fiscal rules and deficit targets for this year while - once I have secured the agreement to lead to it being passed - facing charges that the budget is in some way inconsistent with the fiscal requirements I must meet.  I am responsible for this budget and I was responsible for negotiating its passage through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> On the points the Deputy put to me in respect of outsourcing, she can rest assured that the level of enthusiasm I have for outsourcing is roughly the same as was the case when Deputy Howlin was running this Department.  Whatever role I can see regarding outsourcing will not precipitate any rush to the bottom in terms of wage levels or service levels.  I want efficiencies and value for the taxpayer but I am aware of my other obligations and I will do my best to meet those also.  That is one of the reasons collective agreements matter.  I have been at pains to say, both privately and publicly today, that collective agreements have benefits that flow both ways.  That has been a factor in the agreement we have reached today.<\/p><p> In the context of our assessment of the demographics, a detailed paper on that, which I will share with the committee, was produced by my Department.  We know that to fully meet the demographic pressures, particularly in education, our public service numbers would need to grow by approximately 3% per year until 2021, and education is a big part of that.  As this D&aacute;il develops and as we get into the passage of future budgets, which I am determined to see passed but everybody has a role to play in making sure that happens, that will become a far bigger factor.  It will be a factor when the Government publishes its Estimates on the fiscal space for 2018, which we will do in the mid-term expenditure update in the middle of this year.<\/p><p> Brexit is absolutely a factor.  In my capital review, in particular, and in the terms of reference I have agreed with my Department, Brexit is part of it.  I make specific reference to it and to the regional consequences of Brexit because I am aware that the north-west of our country is facing particular pressure in terms of infrastructure, and that will be exacerbated if we see very negative consequences from Brexit materialise.<\/p><p> That leads on to the accusation that we are in some way anti-urban.  I assure the Deputy, as somebody who lives a few minutes away from O'Connell Street and represents a constituency in the middle of Dublin adjacent to hers, that I see no evidence that this is a constituency that is in any way anti-urban.  Many of the decisions we are making in the area of public transport, for example, are with a view to trying to serve larger urban centres.  It is our larger cities, most notably Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, with their high concentrations of population, that will benefit from some of many decisions we have made in respect of housing.<\/p><p> With regard to the breakdown of expenditure for child care, we have made available an additional &euro;86 million for the roll-out of the extended child care scheme that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has announced.  That forms part of an increase of &euro;174 million for her Department, which, in percentage terms, was by some way the largest beneficiary of budget 2017.  I do not believe they are underfunded in any way but the Deputy is correct that this is only for three months of that scheme.  My understanding is that the target live date for that scheme was October 2016 and the full-year cost of that would then be taken into account in discussions I will have with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for 2017.  That will also feed into the expenditure report we will publish in the middle of this year.<\/p><p> Finally, I have already given my view on fiscal rules and how we take account of capital expenditure with regard to that but under the division of responsibilities that was carried forward into this Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has overall responsibility for that area as the person who sets the overall expenditure ceilings for Government.  He is leading the Government view on that matter but he is well aware of my views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#J00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I have a brief supplementary question.  To refer again to the urban-rural situation, there are a couple of reports in the Irish Independent today that a house restoration grant is to be made available for young couples in rural towns and villages.  In the areas the Minister and I represent, the cheapest option for many young couples in terms of getting their first house will be a second-hand house.  It is grossly unfair, and a poor policy, that if funding is given - which I do not have a problem with if the money is available - for properties in villages and towns in rural Ireland, it is wrong not to make something equivalent available when many young couples literally have a gap they cannot cross in terms of being in a position to both buy houses and then, particularly if they are buying second-hand properties, whether in urban or rural Ireland, to give these people some support in upgrading them.<\/p><p>The report was attributed to a scheme the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is to launch shortly.

That is what the report seeks to address.  Alongside that, areas with high population densities, which are concentrated in larger urban areas and cities, will be the main beneficiaries at the same time of improved public transport plans such as: Luas Cross City; the availability of more buses - for example, to Dublin Bus; and the potential for a high-capacity metro link.  Because of the lower population densities of other parts of the country, these facilities' equivalents might be available but the scale of investment is unlikely to be.

I say this with respect.  The Minister has a responsibility to do this.  He came before the predecessor of this committee, the budgetary arrangements committee, and talked in glowing terms about how the Executive and the committee need to work together.  This is it now.

The reason I have brought forward that proposal for &euro;120 million, and I am confident I will be able to identify that figure, is that because in previous years, leaving aside the issue of buoyancy and what happens in tax take, processes and work that my Department has done have yielded figures that are higher than that.  When I complete the work I am going to do across this year on how we will pay for this bill and the detail of how we will pay for it, I will be accountable to members and I will discharge that responsibility.

That is why I have made the decision to which the Government has agreed today.

Will this be in higher expenditure?  Will it be in the reallocation of expenditure?  Will it be in other choices that we make?  I will account for that across this year.  To conclude on this point, unless I deal with this now, my assessment is I will face larger risks and larger figures in the second half of this year.  While I will not read it out again, as the Deputy already has heard it, I read into the record of the committee the recommitment that has been made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, on industrial stability and the Lansdowne Road agreement.

The danger in all of that is to service delivery.  We have constituents and we know what is happening.  Unfortunately, in my constituency efficiencies in the health service meant that when people who had home help support passed away, that home help support was taken into the Health Service Executive and 50% of it was reallocated.  This meant people could not get out of hospitals or nursing homes and back into the community.  That is what are called \"efficiencies\".  Moreover, the non-recruitment of people into positions was deemed to be savings by the Department.  I just do not think it is credible.

If the entire public pay bill was to go down the route it faced the risk of going down towards the end of 2016, the figures the Government would be asked but would be unable to find would be many multiples of this.  They would be costs that would transfer into 2018, 2019 and 2020.  That is unlike the agreement that I have today.  One of the main reasons I am doing it, the Deputy has referred to the risks to service delivery, is that I am always doing this with a mind to those who depend on our public services.  It is my judgment that a very significant risk exists to service delivery in our country if collective agreements, the principle of which I believe Sinn F&eacute;in supports, are undermined.  I face that risk in the absence of this agreement.  That is why I have made the choices I have in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Across this year, I will respond to the Oireachtas as to how this matter will be dealt with.  I have outlined the options available as to how we will deal with it.  I am repeating myself but then again, so has Deputy Doherty in terms of the points he has put to me.  I believe the savings from the options available to me to generate this figure are equivalent to - and the figures that were delivered in the past, in 2016 in particular, are lower than - the cost of this agreement.  In the absence of this agreement, I would have faced a horizon of potentially hundreds upon hundreds of millions of risk for our public service pay bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#M00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>A key thing that this committee has to do is scrutinise policy positions prior to them being enacted.

Let me put the question to him again.  There is no doubt in my mind, or maybe he can tell me I am wrong, but that the Department has provided the Minister with a paper or a page to suggest from where efficiencies or savings can be gained within the public sector or within the public pay bill.  I am asking the Minister, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and I am not sure if members will endorse this request, to provide that to us in order that we can do our job and scrutinise what is now a budgetary measure.

Given how underfunded many areas are, such as health, they could do with a bit of upward flexibility and discretion but now they will not have it.  Extra revenues should have been raised through larger contributions in corporate tax, financial transaction tax, taxes on those with higher incomes and a landlord tax, as we proposed in our alternative budget submissions, to ensure some pay restoration.

As the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, one of the things we cannot detach ourselves from is the potential impact of unknown quantities being spent throughout the year on the budget.  I warmly welcome the proposal the Minister has brought forward.  I believe it is a proposal of common sense.  It brings forward basic clarity and gives a defined figure for a cost for the year.  It takes out that uncertain risk.  I have no doubt that there are hundreds of thousands of public sector workers throughout the country who are very pleased with this announcement today.  From a budgetary perspective, being able to put a figure on this at this point in the year and effectively to put a cap on it is something that we should welcome.  I commend the Minister on his work.  If we look back to last December, and this is a reference the Minister himself made, I do not think anybody here would have believed that we would have reached this type of agreement and understanding.

As members will be aware, at the 16th EU-Canada summit in Brussels, on 30 October 2016, EU leaders and the Canadian Prime Minister signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement.  The landmark deal which runs to some 2,500 pages represents a comprehensive transatlantic trade agreement which seeks to eliminate or reduce trade barriers in virtually all sectors of EU-Canada trade.  Our most recent experience of applying a comprehensive trade agreement with one of the third countries, South Korea, has seen a 25% increase in trade.  If this trade intensification were to be replicated in the case of Canada on foot of full application of the CETA, Ireland could expect exports to rise by &euro;500 million per annum.  The total value of Irish exports to Canada is &euro;2.3 billion per year, with the total value of imports being &euro;729 million.  We expect these levels to increase as the CETA covers not only the traditional tariffs and quotas which apply to goods but will also free up trade in services. <\/p> <p>  Ireland is the fourth largest recipient of Canadian foreign direct investment.  The stock of Canadian direct investment in Ireland amounted to approximately &euro;11 billion at the end of 2015.  With Canadian companies already investing actively in Ireland and employing some 2,800 people, an increased focus on bilateral trade and targeting inward investment from Canada can lead only to further growth. <\/p> <p>  Almost half of the benefits anticipated under the CETA are expected to be in the services sector.  There is a significant opportunity for Ireland, given its strengths in services.  It has been particularly successful in expanding its share of the world&rsquo;s services market in recent years; in fact, our share has tripled in the past 15 years.  Services exports account for more than half of all Irish exports.  In the case of goods exports, the CETA will save on duty costs, as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force of the agreement.  Firms exporting from Ireland will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on \"double testing\" on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is of particular benefit to smaller firms which can ill afford to pay twice for the same certification test. <\/p> <p>  The CETA provides for a significant opening up of agrifood trade.  Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the European Union, thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  We were also successful in securing the multi-annual phasing in of the additional quota granted.  On the other hand, in terms of our offensive interests, we have secured full unrestricted access for Irish beef and other meat products to the Canadian market. <\/p> <p>  In recent years Ireland has developed an important pigmeat export trade to Canada and there is now potential to develop the export business for Irish beef and lamb products also.  The removal of the Canadian import tariff of 26.5% will benefit Irish meat exporters.  The CETA also provides significant new opportunities for the Irish dairy sector.  In addition, there are a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies arising from greater access to the Canadian market, including in financial software, telecoms, digital media, agricultural machinery, the life sciences and medical devices.<\/p> <p>  On public procurement, for the first time, Canadian provinces, territories and municipalities will open their procurement markets to third countries.  Canada will also create a single electronic procurement website that will combine information on all tenders which will correspond to existing intra-EU arrangements.  This will greatly facilitate the effective access of firms to procurement opportunities in Canada.  Making the trading landscape easier is particularly important for SMEs enabling them to internationalise and grow exports.  Trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms which have fewer resources relative to larger firms to overcome them. <\/p> <p>  As well as providing new market opportunities for Irish firms, the CETA has the potential to provide consumers, businesses and individuals with a greater choice of quality products at lower prices. <\/p> <p>  As Members will be aware, the Council's decision of October 2016 provides for the provisional application of the CETA, such application being a standard approach in trade agreements.  Procedurally at this point, provisional application requires a favourable vote in the European Parliament plenary session in February - this is likely to occur on 17 February - following a recommendation from the International Trade Committee of the Parliament, INTA, on 24 January.  However, members may be aware that certain provisions of the CETA will not be applied provisionally.  Most noteworthy among them are those relating to investment protection and investment dispute settlement.  The European Union and Canada have also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument that was added to tje CETA to provide further assurances on public services, labour rights, water services, sustainable development, environmental protection and investment. <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will also be aware that the opinion of the European Court of Justice has already been sought on the EU-Singapore free trade agreement to determine the limits of the European Union&rsquo;s competence in the matter of trade and foreign direct investment.  The opinion of the Advocate General was published on 21 December 2016.  It indicated that the EU-Singapore free trade agreement could only be concluded by the European Union and the member states acting jointly, in other words, it was a mixed agreement.  The opinion contains the Advocate General's view of the law and recommends to the court how it should decide the case.  The court has yet to make a decision, but it is due to do so in early 2017.  Ireland argued at the court that the Singapore agreement was mixed.  That has also been our position on the CETA.  Accordingly, in order for the CETA to be fully ratified by the European Union, it will have to be approved by all 28 member states in line with their national legal procedures.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the agreement will be brought before the D&aacute;il for ratification in due course. <\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies in focusing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.  Enterprise Ireland stands ready to support Irish companies in seeking to take early advantage of the opportunities presented by the CETA and will be supporting additional trade events in Canada in the coming year to help Irish businesses to enter the market or expand their presence, including in particular, through a trade mission later this year to be led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor.<\/p> <p>  The agreement is very important to Ireland.  The CETA and the European Union&rsquo;s other trade agreements will help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide opportunities for Irish firms.  The importance of applying and exploiting existing agreements and accelerating negotiations on new trade deals at EU level and in the WTO is underscored by Brexit.  Trade diversification has been a consistent national policy objective.  While progress has undoubtedly been made, the need to further reduce our dependence on a limited number of markets and, in particular, the United Kingdom, will be a key element in mitigating the negative impacts of Brexit.  Continued access to the European Union&rsquo;s network of trade agreements is just as important and a significant competitive advantage for Irish exporters and iinvestors seeking to establish in Europe.  From experience, we know that an open global trading environment works for Ireland.  The combination of export-led growth and foreign direct investment has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the longer term and more recently played a key role in national economic recovery.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth. <\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will happy to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his statement.

We had a similar position in the Canadian deal.  With respect to opening up services markets, concessions are made to allow people to come to Ireland or the EU or to go to Canada to try to promote their services or deliver a services contract.  If a person got a contract to deliver ICT services or something, he or she would get temporary permission to enter Canada to deliver that service.

It said that CETA must be decent in terms of \"job creation, balanced wage increases and expanding enterprise possibilities.

As members will be aware, that line of production has different economies of scale and costs than producing with hormones or GMOs.  There is no lessening of the food quality or safety standards in the beef that would be admitted to the European market, and that tends towards levelling the costs or any cost disadvantage caused by the size of the Canadian industry and Europe.  The corollary is that Irish farmers will have unrestricted access to sell premium beef products into the Canadian market, whereas the Canadians are subjected to a quota in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Tariff free?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Tariff free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>In the agreement there is no specific chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and that is a concern I would have.

There may be concerns about some countries regarding the separation of powers, the protection of intellectual property and a whole range of issues.<br\/><br\/>It would also be very difficult to ask a Canadian investor to invest in Europe and deal with 28 different constitutions and legal systems of jurisprudence.  Looking at Europe as a single market, a Canadian investor would like to invest in a place with a single set of investment protection rules.  The investment protection rules proposed in the ICS are not the law of the European Union and they are not the law of Ireland.  They are an arbitration mechanism under this agreement which can be opted for.  A Canadian firm owning a firm in Ireland can sue the Government in the morning.  If the Government causes harm to a Canadian firm here, it can go to the Four Courts and sue it.  The investment protections apply a common set of rules in 28 member states that would be applied by a single panel of people as an arbitration mechanism and as an alternative to using the domestic courts.

It cannot even make a finding that an Act is legal or illegal.  It can only state that, based on the terms of reference of the agreement, an investor was treated in an unfair or inequitable way and discriminated against.

The UK Government, along with the Governments of the other 27 member states, approved the provisional application of CETA at Council level.  I would guess that it is anxious to see the provisional application in place.  As the Deputy is aware, the UK Government has spoken about transitional arrangements.  It is probably anxious to avail of all the benefits of all the trade agreements, including on a transitional basis, pending the conclusion of its own agreements with third countries.  The UK Government is already a party to the provisional application.  The national ratification process, for which there is no time limit and which normally takes three or four years, is the reason the application is provisional.  If the agreement is approved by the European Parliament in a plenary vote in February, we will move almost immediately to provisional application, immediate entry into force and the imposition of a 0% rate of tariffs on 99% of industrial goods.  The clock will begin to run in the agriculture area, where there will be special phasings over a long number of years.  For the next two years, at least, the UK will have the full benefit of provisional application, obviously minus the investment protection or the investment court system, which will not come into effect until the agreement has been ratified by all 36 or 38 member states.  It is difficult to know whether the absence of the UK from the final ratification of the agreement would be material.  Countries on the other side, such as Canada, might regret the concessions they made when they reached agreement on the basis of being able to access a market of 500 million people when the market is no longer of that size.

I refer particularly to the predictions in the report about what CETA will bring to the EU.  I ask Mr. Kelly for his comments on the matter.  The European Parliament committee has looked at this in detail, as I assume the departmental officials have done.  According to the committee's report, \"at best [there will be] marginal overall increases for EU employment of no more than 0.018% over a 6 to 10 year implementation period\".  The report refers to a \"forecast [of] actual job losses of 204,000 for the EU as a whole\".  The figures for profits are slightly better, with the report envisaging \"a 0.66% increase in favor of capital owners\".  As an opponent of CETA and as a member of a trade union, Unite, and a political party that opposes the agreement, I ask Mr. Kelly to address that.<\/p> <p>  I am one of the many people who have lobbied, campaigned and protested against the nature of this type of agreement, as other speakers have already mentioned.  We contend that CETA places at risk the safeguarding of workers' rights, environmental rights and local labour law and strengthens the protections for international capital, employers and companies.  I suggest Mr. Kelly admitted that when he said the courts, through the system of investor-state dispute mechanisms, will protect Canadian people who want to invest in Ireland.  He intimated that at present, someone who is hurting because of our laws can go to the Four Courts and take a case against the Irish Government.  I would like him to spell out to me what he means by \"hurt\".  Under CETA, we could be sued in the international courts system not because we have hurt people or impinged on their profits, but because they have lost out on a reasonable expectation of profit.  They might not have lost a single penny, a single job or a single boat or airplane, but they might have lost out on a reasonable expectation of making more money.  On that basis, we are allowing questions to be raised with regard to our labour and environmental protection laws.<\/p> <p>  A Bill proposing to prohibit fracking in Ireland has been tabled by a Fine Gael Deputy and Government supporter and is to be considered on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il shortly.  Lone Pine Resources sued the Canadian Government to the tune of $260 million because it did not want to see fracking banned in the province of Quebec.  Would it not be a great irony if a company from Canada were to take Ireland to court for not allowing fracking in Leitrim?  This D&aacute;il democratically decided to express its opposition to fracking by supporting a Bill that was proposed by a Fine Gael Deputy just before Christmas.  I mention that in the context of Senator Gavan's contention that there is a contradiction in all of this with regard to how we deal with democracies.  This proposal undermines local and international democracy.  This Parliament has decided that it does not want fracking because it is concerned about the poisoning of our groundwater and about climate change.  We do not think we need to extract any more fossil fuels from the earth.<\/p> <p>  We have listened to the many local opponents of fracking and decided that we do not want it.  I am concerned that a company, or an individual who feels he is being hurt because he could have had a reasonable expectation of profit in County Leitrim, will be able to take us to one of these courts and sue us for millions of euro.  Companies have previously sued states on the basis of a loss of reasonable expectation.  This has happened to some of the poorest countries, including Ecuador, and to some of the richest countries, including Canada and the US.  Under this system, decisions on such cases will not be made by a friendly court that represents citizens, but by a court that is structured to represent the interests of business.  The interests of people and the environment are being undermined for the interests of profit.  I know that is a mouthful, but I would like Mr. Kelly to address it so that we can get a holistic view of what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy like Mr. Kelly to respond to the questions she has already asked before she asks any more questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I do not mind.

I am not familiar with the economic modelling used by the employment committee of the European Parliament.  I am familiar with the economic modelling that the European Commission uses.  It is the same modelling that we rely on domestically here - the computable general equilibrium model.  It considers trade and the composition of trade between all member states.  It applies changed scenarios and tariffs, changes to technical barriers to trade to existing trading relationships and tries to model what would happen.  Under that sort of modelling our anticipation is that CETA would support additional job creation and higher value-added or higher-paid jobs in the economy.<\/p><p> We are the subject of constant churn between agriculture, manufacturing and new areas of the services economy.  That transfer of employment between sectors is well established.  We know that trade agreements only generally provide a small increment to that transfer.  We expect that a new trade deal would see certain sectors of the economy attract more capital, be more profitable and create more jobs.  If we had a closed labour market, one might see employment fall in other areas of the economy as employment was created in higher value-added sectors of the economy.  We do not have a closed economy in the European Union and therefore, we anticipate that we will see increased job creation in higher value and more sustainable jobs in the economy in the long-term.  That is our national estimation of what CETA would do for us.  It would create more sustainable jobs in exporting firms in the economy.  We know that exporting firms ride out recessions better and avail of product and service innovation better and that on average, firms pay better in the exporting part of the economy.  We just have to differ in terms of the views of the employment committee of the European Parliament and rely on the sort of the analysis we do, and that the European Commission has done and which, in the case of the European Commission, is in the public domain.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked me questions on expectations of profits.  To clarify, the reason that companies or somebody would feel hurt is established under CETA's terms.  It states that one has to be discriminated against or to have been the object of unfair inequitable treatment.  CETA defines all of that in terms of denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, as well as a fundamental breach of due process in judicial proceedings or a lack of transparency.  Other grounds are if the treatment one has received has been manifestly arbitrary, if one has been the object of targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds such as gender, race or religious belief or if, as an investor, one has been the object of abusive treatment, duress or harassment.  These are the grounds and that is the sort of negativity whereby somebody might complain that their intellectual property rights or other rights have been infringed or expropriated by a state.<\/p><p> On the issue of profit expectation, the agreement explicitly states that a reduction of somebody's expectation of profits is not a breach of the investment protections of the agreement.  If, however, one were the subject of a harmful act by a government, how would we value one's business or investment?  There are standard accounting treatments by which businesses are valued in terms of their assets.  One can value their property, vans or machinery or one might value their contracts or distribution channels.  Anybody valuing a business does so on the basis of it being a going concern as otherwise, one is just buying a set of assets.  Under any accounting treatment when one values a business or a business that has been damaged, it is considered to be a going concern.  As part of that one considers the return on the capital employed.  One would consider future profits and whether its income stream had been damaged by the harm complained about.  There is nothing exceptional about looking at an investment whether it is a stock on a stock market or buying a business.  One values the business based on its income stream.  The expectation is not of somebody who might invest in Ireland and the profits he or she might have made but of somebody who has an investment, can prove he or she was discriminated against and damaged and who can point to a reduction in the value of his or her investment or business using a standard accounting technique that would value a business as a going concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I refer to a scenario in which a company like Lone Pine Resources already was based in Ireland and had an interest in extracting gas, for example in the Corrib field but wanted to extract shale gas in Leitrim.

A reservation is an exception in the general competition rules such that a member state does not have to open its market in these areas.  There are specific exceptions included in the treaty and there is also a set of annexes.  The first annexe is about existing reservations the European Union has.  It is a general set of reservations and covers business, health, transport, cultural, education, air transport and energy services, to mention a few.

As he has outlined, it has taken more than seven years for it to be comprehensively ratified and it still has a long way to go.  To expand on that conversation, I have a question about the situation in America, one of our larger export markets.  How realistic are the claims that America will agree to a trade agreement with Britain in a number of weeks?   The delegates have great experience.  As they have dealt with the CETA and everything else, I am curious about their opinions on both of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#F01200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>We have not identified pitfalls in the CETA agreement, save to say if we did not have it, those involved in some sectors of the economy would be denied access to markets.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are all the time calling on firms to diversify and get into new markets.  One part of the equation is the work Enterprise Ireland does in helping firms to identify target markets.  The other part is identifying the tariffs their goods will face in these markets and what other behind the border barriers they will face.  We have to work on the terms of trade, as well as facilitating individual companies.  The world around us is negotiating trade agreements.  Will we step aside from taking part when our entire output requires the export of beef, services, pharma-chem products and ICT equipment?  We are exporting far more than the domestic market could support in these areas of specialism and high value.  The danger to us lies in not taking part and not liberalising and taking advantage of the opportunities when the economy and individual firms have shown how well they can compete.  The danger posed by the agreement is that Irish firms will be out-competed by other member states and their companies or will not be equipped to avail of these market opening opportunities.  It will come down to individual firms identifying market opportunities in Canada in public procurement for software, medical devices etc.  My confidence comes from the Irish firms which throughout the huge recession managed to lead recovery through export-led growth.  It will involve not being left behind.  Trade openness tends to stimulate innovation in the economy.  The pressure of competing with other countries and firms to sell in Canada will stimulate innovation and, therefore, sustainability in Irish firms.

If we wanted to do a deal on tariffs on goods, which are very low generally, we could go to zero tariffs on many non-sensitive goods very quickly but the real advantage to sophisticated economies is being able to sell services to each other.  That requires recognition of professional qualifications and that we allow people move across the Border to look for and deliver those services.  It requires mutual recognition of safety testing, product standards and a range of very complicated issues over which sometimes, including in the United States, central government does not have control.  In other words, there are state level regulators who determine the standards.  For the United States Administration, either in public procurement or regulatory standards in the US, to Sherpa and all of the state level interests, it is extremely complex.  It is possible to do a deal relatively quickly with the United Kingdom, perhaps in a short number of years.  The issue would be whether it was a comprehensive deal covering services as well as goods and whether it could cover investment and investment protection.

One of the areas that has been of particular concern is public health policy.  That is the tip of an iceberg that has been reflected in some of the commentary here already in terms of the concerns about this deal that unforeseen advantage may be given to outside multinational companies that could take advantage of the situation here to our detriment.  To cut to the chase, I would be grateful if Mr. Kelly would outline the position, taking specifically public health policy on tobacco.  From what he said already, it would appear to me that if something is banned in this country and across the European Union, or even not across the entire EU, our laws prevail and nothing within this agreement can undermine those laws.  Mr. Kelly's colleague, Ms Benson, is nodding in assent but it would help everybody if Mr. Kelly could lay that out in terms of the tobacco industry in particular in which there are several actors.  There is a market here already.  They will now have to comply with new arrangements to do with plain packaging, to mention but one aspect that may come down the track in the future.  He might highlight how he would see those provisions that we have put in our public health policy to protect public health from the deadly threat tobacco represents, with 6,000 Irish people dying every year from tobacco related illnesses and 700,000 people dying across Europe, not being undermined.  That would reassure me, and I am fairly reassured already.  While I accept all the arguments Mr. Kelly has made, it would also demonstrate clearly how this agreement cannot undermine our laws, our Constitution and any policy this Oireachtas would put into law, and that it is not discriminatory against one provider of a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>One does not have to go far overseas to see that.  One only has to look around the European Union, whether it is to do with plain packaging or something else, to see there is a diversity of views.  However, to refer to this deal, the agreement sets out the European Union and member states' right to regulate in the public interest and specifically talks about doing that with regard to the promotion of public health, social services, public education, safety, environment, public morals, social or consumer protection, privacy and data protection, and cultural diversity.  That is in the joint interpretative declaration which, as the Senator knows, has the same status as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, under the Vienna Convention.  The treaty states that the Government has a right to regulate in the public interest but there is always a debate internationally about what is the public interest.  In the past, we and the Senator have fought that fight both at the World Trade Organization, WTO, and elsewhere where people tried to challenge issues like plain packaging.  It is important that that is seen to be in the public interest and that there is an evidence base for those actions.  As far as I am concerned, however, both in the text of the agreement and in the joint interpretation that Canada and the European Union have put as an integral part of the agreement, they restate for the avoidance of doubt the state's right to regulate in the interest of the public and, in particular, public health.  I do not see scope for that issue to be unravelled as it stands in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I call Senator Higgins and thank her for attending today.

I appreciate the opportunity to be here and thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation.  Before I ask a question, I want to pick up on one point.  We have been hearing of the benefits but Mr. Kelly mentioned our own research.  The only research we know we have in Ireland is that Ireland asked, regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is a similar agreement, that the Copenhagen institute would do research.  The benefits it found for Ireland, in terms of economic growth, were 0.01% per year.  When the European Commission and the Canadian Government did research into the potential benefits of CETA, they came up with 0.01% of economic growth as the potential economic benefit.  It is important that we keep those figures in mind because some of the figures we saw relating to South Korea etc. may have been slightly inflationary.  The figures from the European Commission are much closer to the figures we saw from the employment committee.  They are quite low compared with the figures relating to South Korea.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, further research would be beneficial in that small firms will benefit.  Except with regard to assumed benefits in terms of navigation of paperwork etc., it would be good to look to similar agreements between equal partners such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the extent to which small firms have or have not benefited versus larger corporations.  If Mr. Kelly had information on that, I would be very interested to see it.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask two questions, the first of which concerns the negative list mentioned.  It is quite a short list for Ireland.  Germany has an 18-page list, but what is interesting about the German list is that it also excludes a large number of areas of legal provision and it states that those areas are not affected or impacted by the Bill.  It seems Germany took quite a different approach in terms of exclusions.  While Mr. Kelly mentioned the European exclusions, it is interesting that other countries still felt they needed to put in additional exclusions.  A question arises in that regard from which it would be important to learn.<\/p> <p>  There are also concerns regarding some of the European level exclusions Mr. Kelly mentioned.  Has a proofing exercise taken place with regard to each of those in terms of our public services in each of the areas mentioned, for example, transport, health and others?  There has been some ambiguity about what is considered a service of general interest and whether the services we provide meet the standards for exclusion.  In some cases recently, Ireland has been told that we do not meet the standards for exclusion, perhaps because there is a private actor also operating in an area.  The proofing exercise that might have taken place in regard to that is important.<\/p> <p>  There is also concern about what is called the ratchet clause, a phrase not in the Bill, in that if an area is in public delivery currently, it would seem, from looking at CETA and the text, that if an area were privatised, it would be very difficult to return it to public delivery.  It seems the only changes that can take place regarding service delivery are to increase the openness and private access.  What would be the impact of reversing a sector, as it were?  How would Mr. Kelly see that as being possible?  For example, in terms of experiments such as those that have taken place in the Department of Social Protection where it has outsourced certain contracts and services, if it wanted to take that back into public delivery again, how might that work?<\/p> <p>  I believe this is important, and I would like to hear Mr. Kelly's comments on it, because the negative list is a new process that has never been done previously.<\/p><p>We have never had a negative list system whereby that which is not explicitly excluded is included.  We are in a new zone here.  It is important to recognise this is not standard practice but a new practice.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses.<\/p><p> With regard to the investor court system, the witnesses mentioned that it is an opt-in.  It is, of course, not an opt-out so states that sign up, if this is finally ratified, will not have an option to opt out from it.  When the witnesses say it is a choice, the choice is only on the part of the corporation as to whether or not to choose to access this mechanism.  It is not a choice for states.  It is also important to clarify that indigenous companies would not be able to access this mechanism within Ireland and, similarly, citizens and governments would have no access to it.  This is entirely a mechanism which can be initiated and activated by corporations and companies, if I am correct, whereas the interpretative instrument mentioned by the witnesses and the committees mentioned do not have any of the same teeth.  The witnesses can perhaps correct me on that.<\/p><p> The interpretative instrument was added to with the very belated inclusion of the Vienna convention and its committees some seven hours before the proposed signing.  What mechanisms do the witnesses believe states would have through those committees if there were concerns in regard to issues such as the environment, employment rights and equality rights?  What would be the enforcement mechanisms?  We know the mechanism of the investor court system, which has the power to demand compensation, as the witnesses put it very explicitly.  Nobody is suggesting that states would lose the right to regulate but the key point is that states having the right to regulate would now come with a compensatory cost.  As was said, future unearned profit may not be the reason that can be put forward but another reason may be put forward.  If we look at dispute mechanisms around the world, the evidence is that the bar has been quite low.  With regard to climate change, during the case currently being taken against the United States in regard to the oil pipeline, it was stated that citing climate change as an issue of public interest was considered an inadequate defence and that the company should still be compensated.  A case is ongoing in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The Senator might conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I want to ask one concrete question in regard to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.

I accept this is not available to domestic firms, which would have recourse exclusively to domestic law.  As we are trying to entice inward investment, we are providing a special mechanism to them rather than offering them 28 different constitutions and national laws by which they might try to vindicate their rights.
