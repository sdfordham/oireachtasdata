When I was drawing up my opening statement I had to make some suppositions and assumptions about what the British position might be.  This morning, we heard the British Prime Minister lay out in clear terms what her strategy is and it is not good news for the Irish agrifood sector.<br\/><br\/>The way to try to understand this is to recall 1973, when both Ireland and the United Kingdom joined what was then the European Economic Community, EEC, and later the European Union.  Before that time we were selling into the British market, obviously in competition with other exporters, and we were getting essentially the world market price.  There was some opportunity under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement to benefit from some of the deficiency payments the UK had at the time for some of our livestock exports, but basically we were selling at world market prices.  For us, joining the European Union at the same time as the British meant that we got the benefit of the protection provided by the common external tariff.  The Common Agricultural Policy was important but this tariff wall required the British consumer to pay the higher EU price rather than the world market price after membership.  Irish exporters were able to benefit from what I call that trade transfer.  We were able to benefit because we were protected in selling to that market after membership <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>third countries that were outside the tariff wall.  For me, the announcement by the British Prime Minister today that she is not seeking to remain within the customs union is probably the most significant part of her statement.  I believe we will see the UK reverting to a less protectionist position for its agriculture.  I am not suggesting that it will go to zero tariffs, but it is highly unlikely that it will retain the high level of tariffs we have in Europe.<br\/><br\/>We also heard her say in no uncertain terms that she wishes Britain to be open to trade with the rest of the world.  She wishes to sign trade agreements, which would embrace many competitive agricultural exporters, so we can expect to see that even if we maintain duty free access to the United Kingdom market under a free trade agreement, and I will comment on that shortly, it will be a far less valuable market for us in the future.  That is the biggest difficulty I foresee for the Irish agrifood sector following Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The British Prime Minister has indicated that she will seek a free trade agreement.  That is an important objective for Ireland also, so that at least we will not have tariffs put on our exports in addition to the lower market price when exporting to the UK market.  Of course, the value of that free trade agreement will depend on the size of the tariffs which the UK Government decides to put in place once it has the ability to do so.  To take an extreme situation, and I do not believe it is likely, if the United Kingdom were to decide to eliminate tariffs on its agrifood imports, a free trade agreement does not really mean anything because we, along with the Brazilians, New Zealanders and Australians, would have duty free access anyway.  In that case the free trade agreement is not very important.  It is important to the extent that the UK retains some positive protection for its farmers after Brexit.  I expect it to do so, therefore the suggestion that the UK will at least seek a free trade agreement is one of the few positive things we can take from the statement today.<br\/><br\/>It will take time to negotiate a free trade agreement.  The withdrawal from the Union is negotiated under Article 50 of the treaty but negotiating a free trade agreement is a different negotiation under Article 218, with its own rules, Council mandate and so forth.  There is much concern, which I share, that it is not clear if the European Union will be able to start negotiating such a free trade agreement until the United Kingdom has left the EU.  This, of course, raises the question of the cliff edge.<\/p><p>A free trade agreement, which will be negotiated under a separate set of procedures, could well take longer than the actual withdrawal negotiation itself.  If the British timeline is held to and Brexit occurs in spring 2019, I think it is unlikely we will see a free trade agreement in place by then.  Accordingly, the question of what transitional arrangements might be put in place to avoid the re-imposition of tariffs is an important strategic issue for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the free trade element, the UK Prime Minister has indicated that Britain wishes to withdraw from the Single Market.  The Single Market has allowed us to trade, not only with the United Kingdom but with other EU countries in a seamless way without the administrative checks and paperwork required before 1992 when it came into effect.  We are going to see some additional trading costs simply because the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the Single Market.  What will these additional costs be?  For example, an Irish meat factory, once it is inspected by the Irish authorities and approved to sell its products on the Irish market, can also sell those products on the British and French markets without any further checks.  It is assumed it will meet the relevant EU standards.  That will no longer be the case after Brexit.  The British authorities may decide to change when they leave.  They will have exactly the same regulations in place that we have.  However, over time, these regulations may evolve and change.  In any case, the British authorities will wish to ensure our processing plants meet their standards.<br\/><br\/>We will need to ensure these additional costs are minimised as far as possible.  It is possible to do this through mutual recognition agreements where two sides agree to recognise each other's agencies and systems for approving, say, plants for food safety and other reasons.  Again, however, that is a trade agreement which has to be signed by the Commission for that mutual recognition to take place.<br\/><br\/>What agricultural policy will the United Kingdom, and its devolved administrations whose responsibility that policy is, pursue after Brexit?  What support will it give through its budget to its farmers?  That is a significantly important question for farmers in the North of Ireland who are heavily dependent on direct transfers at the present time.  With supply chains which link production in the North with processes in the South, there will be issues as to how that level of production may be affected in the future if support is reduced under UK agricultural policy.<br\/><br\/>There are also indirect effects of Brexit.  Obviously, we are all familiar with the exchange rate impacts.  There will be indirect effects from the impact of Brexit on future economic growth rates and migration into the United Kingdom, which obviously will impact on the overall level of demand for Irish exports.  It is clear the UK is a major net contributor to the EU budget and, therefore, to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  After Brexit, there will be a hole in that budget.  Will that be replaced by the other member states?  Several tables in my submission indicate the key sectors which will be mostly affected by Brexit.<br\/><br\/>In my submission, I made six recommendations to the committee to consider.  On the first one, the ship may well have sailed, as it emphasised the importance of encouraging the United Kingdom to remain within the customs union.  One issue is the revenue from the tariffs, which are currently paid into the European budget and are, therefore, a cost to the United Kingdom.  There would have been scope for the United Kingdom to retain that revenue.  It seems, however, the UK Prime Minister has ruled that option out today.<br\/><br\/>In that case, we need to emphasise the importance of concluding a free trade agreement which also covers agrifood trade.  That is not a foregone conclusion.  For example, the European Economic Area agreement does not itself cover agriculture, although there are bilateral agricultural agreements with the members of that agreement.  There are trade-offs involved.  The committee will be aware that the most important UK agricultural export to the rest of Europe is lamb.  The UK is actually self-sufficient in lamb.  The lamb exported is, in a sense replaced, by lamb imported from New Zealand.  If, after Brexit, the UK enters into a free trade agreement with New Zealand, a lot more New Zealand lamb might go into Britain.  One can expect Welsh lamb to be diverted to France in competition with Irish lamb exports.  Is that something with which we would be happy?  Would we want to put a quota on future British lamb exports to avoid that?  In that case, the British would be clearly looking for a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>.  Would they then want to limit exports of interest to us?  There are going to be difficult trade-offs, even in negotiating a free trade agreement.<br\/><br\/>With respect to leaving the Single Market, it is important to underline the importance of mutual recognition agreements to ensure each trading partner recognises the systems in place to approve, for example, veterinary and food safety equivalence.  Clearly we will need to emphasise marketing efforts.  The British market inevitably will be less attractive to our exporters.  We are going to need to provide assistance to look for alternatives either in the rest of the European Union or outside.<br\/><br\/>Brexit is going to be a big negative shock.  We will hear calls for assistance, both from smaller food firms and farmers.  My advice is that this is a permanent shock.  This is not something which is likely to reverse itself in the near future.  Accordingly, if assistance is to be provided, it should be targeted to assist the sector to adjust.  It should not be something which is simply a hand-out to keep the sector going without helping it to adjust.  It is an unfortunate situation but one with which I am afraid we are going to have to live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his thought-provoking presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#D00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for taking the time to present to the committee, as well as for his ongoing research as an agricultural economist and his contribution to the agricultural sector.<\/p><p>I have a couple of key questions.  Today's well-flagged announcement by the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, on the UK's intention to go for a hard Brexit is, as the witnesses pointed out, quite concerning for agriculture more so than any other sector.  It raises many serious questions with which we are going to have to grapple.  Professor Matthews said that he would flesh out his view on the various sectors if he asked to do so.  I would certainly be interested in hearing his view.  He mentioned lamb and I would like to hear his perspective, which will be different to those relating to other sectors.  I would like to hear his thoughts on how Brexit will affect the various sectors.<\/p><p> It is difficult to estimate but what would be the potential loss to the value of our various sectors in the event of a hard Brexit?  I am also interested in the witness's perspective on where Brexit might leave British agriculture.  It is not what we are looking at in this committee but I would like to hear the comparative analysis in respect of it.<\/p><p> What is Professor Matthew's perspective on the quest for new markets in the event of having to find alternatives?

The witness raised a couple of issues in his presentation that I wish to return to.  He mentioned the standards we have here and the standards in Britain.  Many people are saying that when Britain leaves, if it wants to export its goods to the EU, it will also have to maintain the standards the EU have.  The campaign for Brexit was very much based on the rhetoric of getting rid of all the red tape, tossing away Europe and not having to comply with all of its standards.  If it tosses away the standards, Britain will only be able to trade with itself.  Therefore, I believe the argument that was put at that time does not hold water.<\/p> <p>  The witness spoke about the free trade agreements and the customs union, which is bigger than the EU, and involves Turkey, the Isle of Man, and many other countries, was a stepping stone towards the EU.  It is almost like the Single Market, or the common market as we first called it in the 1970s.  That is effectively what the customs union is.  To say that the UK is going to step outside of that union seems an almost incredible step to take, beyond even what was being demanded.  Most people said that Brexit was about leaving the EU, but now they are leaving the customs union as well.  I do not understand what logical benefit the British Prime Minister can bring to the table for the British people by leaving the customs union.  Perhaps the witness can enlighten us on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his thought-provoking analysis.  From listening to him, I definitely would not like to be a farmer in Northern Ireland or the UK facing the consequences of this British decision.  Professor Matthews mentioned Northern Ireland farmers and their dependence on direct payments in particular.  If I was a farmer in Northern Ireland, I would be extremely worried about how that will happen in a post-Brexit scenario.<\/p> <p>  There is analysis needed of how the UK agricultural industry will survive, particularly if a cheap food policy is pursued.  The UK's beef industry has been promoted fairly intensively over the last couple of years.  There were campaigns for Scottish beef and for buying British.  If the UK allows imports in from South America on a tariff-free basis, how will its own industry survive the onslaught?  The other question is about the co-dependency and the processing capacity.  How will that work out in a tariff environment?  In the dairy industry, Northern Ireland is massively dependent on southern processing facilities.  Approximately 3 million litres of milk are transported across the Border each day.  We are seriously dependent on Northern Ireland's capacity in the pig industry.  A significant number of pigs are transported across the Border to be slaughtered.  With a tariff situation or a strict Border, how will the practicalities in this regard work?<\/p> <p>  The professor mentioned lamb exports.  How can the UK have its cake and eat it?  If it wants access to the French market, how can it deny us access to its own market?  If the UK wants to export lamb, there will have to be a lot of serious talking done.  I would fear that lamb exports will be sacrificed for the idea of cheap food in the UK market.  I would like to hear the view of Professor Matthews on that.<\/p> <p>  The sector that is most exposed is our beef sector.  A total of 50% of our beef is exported to the UK market.  I would not have many concerns for dairy because the worldwide price for dairy is fairly similar.  Whether a litre of milk is produced in New Zealand, the United States or in Europe, there is not a huge dissimilarity in price.  I do not see huge difficulties on that side of it.  However, there is a significant worldwide difference in the price of beef.  If we look back ten or 15 years, we exported a huge amount of our beef outside of the EU.  There was a policy decision taken that the EU was the best market on which to focus.  That decision was taken by Bord Bia and I sat on that board at the time.  The prime intention was to sell all of our beef within EU borders.  In a way, that is coming back to haunt us now in that we left markets to which we will now have to return in order to sell beef.<\/p> <p>  What kind of a timescale does the Professor Matthews foresee in order to reduce that 50% dependency down to single digits?  Is it possible to re-establish the markets we left ten or 15 years ago on an economic basis?  Can we economically export into those markets again at our cost of production?  If the answer to that is no, then we have serious problems in our beef sector.  I am not questioning the decision that was taken in good faith to leave those markets, but now 50% of our market could be pulled out from under us.  Does the witness see a timescale, or is it economically possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for those questions, which cover a very broad field.  First of all, in terms of the sector, Deputy McConalogue is absolutely right.  The beef market is clearly the most vulnerable.  The way to look at it is in terms of the degree of self-sufficiency for the product in the UK and then the difference between the UK and the world market price.  In the case of dairying, I agree that the price differences are less.  There will still be a challenge to find alternative markets, for example, if we need to diversify somewhat.  There is still probably a premium for some of the dairy products, but much less so than in the case of beef, lamb and poultry.  I am of the view, therefore, that meat products will be most affected.  Some of the more processed products, such as the infant formula, beers and spirits, are also less dependent on the UK market.  Obviously, the value added back to the farmer is much smaller in the context of these industries.  In terms of looking at the impact at the farm gate, it is essentially the meat sector in which we are going to see problems.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about the future of UK agriculture.  As the Deputy said, it is not directly of concern to the committee but it is of great interest nonetheless.  We have seen very little guidance as yet from the Ministers at the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as to what they might be thinking.  They have promised a consultation with their farmers.  There are very strong environmental interest groups in the UK, which is a very densely-populated country.<\/p><p>These interest groups would like to see more of the funding go towards environmental improvements, but the National Farmers Union is keen to see as much of it as possible retained to provide income support.  Given what the United Kingdom has stated in the past, it is clear that it will probably support its farmers to a lesser extent.  Having said that, I do not assume it will reduce the level of support to zero.  We will probably not have clarity on the question for at least a two-year period while consultations are under way.<\/p><p> There was a question about new markets.  I agree that we have been successful in moving away from dependence on the UK beef market.  It seems that we will have to continue in that regard.  The UK market will be less attractive; we will, therefore, be looking to try to diversify further.  The markets outside the European Union present a problem in that they are less valuable than the EU market.  I am unsure whether I would necessarily suggest we give up these markets, but once export subsidies went, it was clear that we were competing in them at world prices.  It may well be that in the case of some commodities world prices will recover in the future and these markets may become more attractive again.  However, I believe the EU market will be the most obvious place to start, but that is not to say some of the Asian markets where demand is growing will not play a greater role in the future.<\/p><p> The question was asked by Deputy Ferris whether the United Kingdom would have to meet EU standards.  He also asked about the value of the United Kingdom leaving.  That was a question voters in the United Kingdom had to answer in the referendum.  Even if the United Kingdom was to retain the same standards in the future, the actual mechanisms for recognising those standards would be different simply because the United Kingdom would be outside the Single Market.  I share Deputy Ferris' point of view in the sense that even if the standards were to remain the same, many of them are international and not necessarily EU standards.  They are agreed to under the Codex Alimentarius and by other standard setting bodies.  The key issue is who would get to decide whether the UK or Irish plant, depending on the direction of trade, was meeting the standards of the trading partner.  That represents an extra step.  It would involve not only approving the plants but also inspecting consignments crossing borders, at least on the basis of risk.  There would be additional costs that we should try to minimise as much as possible.<\/p><p> I agree that the issues surrounding supply chains with the North will need close consideration.  I am unsure who asked the question, but someone asked whether there was an overall estimate of the cost of Brexit.  I am aware that Teagasc has done some work on this issue.  Now that there is a little more clarity about the scenarios involved, I imagine Teagasc will be working on modelling estimates.  I do not have a figure that I could give to the committee, but I know that Teagasc is working on the issue.<\/p><p> Two issues arise specifically about the North, the first of which is whether the production base might contract if support was to be reduced relative to the current arrangement.  The second concerns the greater complexity of moving supplies across the Border.  For the larger players, this might not be such a great issue because they would be able to handle Customs declaration forms and inspections.  I reckon it would be a bigger problem for smaller firms that only export intermittently but for which it could be an important source of additional revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will move to the next round of questions.

One of the key issues facing the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the response to CAP reform and how it will fit in if Brexit materialises, with particular reference to a reduction in the UK budget.  The figure touted as being the possible reduction is 18% in the net contribution the United Kingdom makes to the budget.  If such a drastic cut to the CAP budget were to materialise, it would have major knock-on effects on the tillage and beef industries, as well as throughout the entire agricultural framework.  How does Professor Matthews propose that it be dealt with?  Does he believe member states will decide to step in and bridge the gap, given what is happening on the eastern side of Europe?  If there was to be a 20% cut in the budget in the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy, what impact would it have on agricultural output in Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Two issues arise with Brexit, the first of which is the trade impact, while the second is the major issue of the CAP payment for this country.  Statistics from Teagasc for beef and grain production suggest farmers survive on the single farm payment.

As he said, this has the potential to be an economic and administrative nightmare, one which will have a seismic impact on the general economy and, in particular, the agrifood industry.  Apart from the price differential, there will be a difficulty in securing alternative markets.  We should be clear about this rather than live in an ivory tower or fantasy land.  There will be currency fluctuations, tariffs, customs barriers to regulate, veterinary inspections, phytosanitary controls and so on, but there is a sense of utopia around the place.  I wonder whether I am in a different place altogether when I hear people suggest we can influence the outcome.  We will have a major job to try to hold back this barrier.<\/p> <p>  The country has produced Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025, one of which I realise is within Government control, while the other is outside its control.  They will have to be reviewed carefully.  Prudent advice will have to be furnished to farmers in the coming years, but there will be a major hullabaloo and everyone will be whinging.<\/p><p>Deputy Cahill is right.  I come from a beef area.  It is hard enough now to produce beef economically and profitably, so what will it be like in this new scenario?  There is a challenging environment ahead.  We must accept that the UK agriculture industry has always been treated as a Cinderella industry by UK Governments.  Their focus is on consumers.  Only ten or 15 years ago, 19% or 20% of what they consumed originated in Brazil and Argentina.  That was reduced to 9% under the trade agreement approximately ten years ago, so already there is potential for the UK to bring in another 11% without any big deal.  That means our 50% will be hit straight away.  We had better realise that the UK will start with cheaper food imports for their consumers and with environmental objectives.  We should know that.  In the UK's overall view, the wider industrial and services sectors are as important as agriculture and the car industry dwarfs all of that.  We need only consider one big factory in Sunderland.  The UK made sure that Nissan was going to be secured.  The farmers will be on the outside, and that will be an issue.<\/p><p> In that context, one would not want to have today's announcement.  As Professor Matthews said, it is a clean break with the trading bloc and the customs union.  Even some of the right wing Tory newspapers last night were not predicting that.  They thought it might well be kept in reserve, but the entire flush of cards came out today.<\/p><p> The UK is a net contributor of &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion to the budget.  I have been speaking about this regularly.  Approximately &euro;7 of every &euro;10 in the CAP budget goes on direct payments.  Without the UK there will be a massive hole in the bucket.  Is it credible, as some people in this country have started saying, that other countries will be asked to contribute to fill that hole?  We must start asking these questions.  Is it the more likely scenario that member states will be asked to make bigger contributions, moving towards almost the co-financing of schemes?  That would raise significant issues for this country.  One does not replace &euro;11 billion in a budget in seconds.  This could be serious and I consider it very serious.  We might well work our way through the other issues in a slow way, not totally neutralising the impacts of today's announcement, but this matter is huge.  Other countries will be looking for a bigger slice of the cake and they will say we have reached the development zone.  Does Professor Matthews think this will be the issue or am I wrong?  Member states will have to make a larger contribution and that would be a significant move towards co-financing, which would be an absolute disaster for us.  We have always articulated that over the years.  Those are the scenarios that now emerge and they trouble me.  We all have an obligation to the more than 100,000 productive farmers in the farming community and the approximately 250,000 people in the agrifood industry who depend on them.  We must be up-front with them and tell them what this means, in so far as we can.<\/p><p> Until today, the only certainty was the uncertainty.  Now, instead of paddling along there is something of a foundation.  Professor Matthews, whom I have known for a number of years, will now be in a position to give better prognostications of the impacts.  He produced a paper six or eight months ago and he probably will revise that, as will the Teagasc economists.  Even in terms of our report, if we consider all of the evidence we have received over the last seven or eight weeks, today's announcement transcends all of that and changes the dynamic of the report we will prepare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#F00500","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Senator Lombard and Deputy Penrose raised the question of the budget gap, so I will make a brief comment on that.  I estimate the figure for the net contribution per annum to be &euro;10 billion to &euro;11 billion.  It has varied a little over the last few years because there have been revisions in national accounts and so forth.  As a percentage of the expenditure in the remaining 27 member states, which is approximately &euro;138 billion, it is not quite as big as 18%.  It is 7% or 8%.  One of the things about other member states making up that gap is that it would not be proportional.  In other words, each member state would not be asked to increase its net contribution by 7% or 8%.  Due to the complexities surrounding the British rebate, four member states get a rebate on having to pay for the British rebate.  In other words, they do not pay as much of that rebate.  If the British rebate goes, these countries will lose that financial advantage.  The four countries concerned, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Austria, would be asked to pay possibly up to 15% more into the budget.  I noted with interest last week that the German state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Spahn, said there was no automatic requirement or expectation that the existing member states would make up the gap in the budget.<br\/><br\/>There are some ways in which the gap could be filled, although I am not suggesting that Ireland should look for these.  However, if tariffs were re-introduced on trade between the EU and the UK, for example, that tariff revenue would be an additional source of revenue to the EU budget and would compensate, to some extent, for some of the loss.  I am not suggesting that we should look to re-impose tariffs, quite the opposite, but that could be the way to secure additional budget revenue.  The Prime Minister was quite vehement that she did not want to continue with what she called vast transfers into the EU budget in the future, but she did not rule out some payments into the EU budget.  In most cases, these are payments for which the UK would get a <i>quid pro<\/i><i>quo<\/i>.  They would be payments into the Horizon 2020 programme or the Erasmus student exchange programme where the UK would expect to get money back.  In other words, it is not a net gain to the EU budget.  The UK will also probably wish to stay in some of the EU agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency, and it will pay a share for that.  It could be the case that at least over a transition period the UK might continue to make what could be called unrequited payments, namely, payments for which it does not get something in return and which therefore would be available to finance general EU budget expenditure.  However, I do not believe the sums involved would be very significant.<br\/><br\/>We will talk about the CAP budget presently, where we can make other general comments.  Brexit will certainly put pressure on that budget, but the CAP budget was probably going to be under pressure from other challenges which we can discuss later.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Penrose quite correctly raised the British attitude to farming, cheap food and so forth.  Again, the qualification to bear in mind is that agriculture in the UK under its devolved government is now a responsibility of the devolved administrations.  It is quite clear that the attitudes of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to agriculture are somewhat different from the attitude in England.  The question is whether the devolved administrations will have the resources through their block grants to implement somewhat different policies.  Agriculture policy is a devolved responsibility in the UK, so we might see some differences across the United Kingdom in the future.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about the importance of the all-Ireland dimension.<\/p><p>The ability to move products and purchase raw materials, animals and so on, without having to worry, not just about the Border but what it means in terms of different regulatory regimes, is very important.  It is a huge benefit to us.  We have seen businesses build very profitable supply chains in both directions on the basis of being able to move products North and South.  There will be a threat to that and it will be more difficult in future, despite the hopes expressed, in a sense, that we will have a soft Border.  There are clearly ways in which we can try to minimise those issues.  For example, we might see electronic and information technology systems used in customs administration and so on that could minimise some of those costs.  It is clearly not a progressive move that we could welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I had a question on the status for the North of Ireland and Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Yes.

I had the benefit of seeing his presentation before but it is timely that he has given it today, when the British Prime Minister set out the objectives.  In many ways, what she said is contradictory.  She seems to hope for the best and does not want membership of the Single Market or the customs union.  There are riders on the objectives.  It must be clear to us that the writing is on the wall.  If she gets the concessions she wants, it will interfere with the integrity of the European Union.  Everything about this smacks of going backwards on Britain's part.  There is the idea that it will again be a global trading nation but the concept of the sun never going down on the British Empire comes to mind.  It seems to be some sort of delusion but I respect that people voted that way.<\/p> <p>  We have had much discussion on this matter.  Our Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May in the context of this issue as it relates to Northern Ireland.  He has also approached the leaders of other member states.  The reality is that for us to get what we want and remain a member state of the Union, we must go to Europe and not Britain.  Do we need a sharper focus?  Nobody can argue but that this is bad for us from an economic and social perspective, as well as with regard to the Northern Ireland issue as a special case.  We must calculate what will be the loss to us.  Of course, we, as progressive Europeans, will try to mitigate that and seek a package from Europe.  We must say to Europe that this is how it will be.  No matter what Prime Minister May says, Britain is not really worried about us.  I do not know if she is really worried about the North of Ireland either to be honest, particularly in light of the way the British Government has behaved.  This could be like a red-letter day.  We can have platitudes - they will keep flowing - and we can talk but suddenly we will wake to the reality, which will not be good.<\/p> <p>  One of the first meetings the committee held involved a discussion with mushroom growers.  We can see the devastation being wrought on them just as a result of sterling's collapse.  We will be looking at fluctuations in sterling, at tariffs, as alluded to, as well as at cheaper agricultural imports.  Prime Minister May can proclaim that she wants the European Union to stay together but she is moving towards undermining all that.  We must make the best of a bad situation but we will have to call it a bit more.  Is that not what we must do?<\/p> <p>  We must go to Europe and seek a package.  We cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hound on this because there is a principle at stake.  If Europe gives too many concessions to the UK and it works out over time with the British delighted, it will be the death knell for Europe as everybody will want more of the same.  We do not know what this is about except disintegration.  We have seen President-elect Trump's attitude to the disintegration of Europe.  We must take stock of our position.

This meeting clashes with that of another committee.  I have two questions but if they have already been answered, we can move on.  In the opening statement there was an indication that the UK would have some obligation to open tariff rate quotas under World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules and provide market access to traditional exporters.  I presume the Irish agrifood sector could be classified as traditional exporters to the UK under the WTO trade rules.  The recommendations indicate we should seek duty-free access to the UK market under WTO or autonomous tariff rate quotas.  When should we start doing that or should we start having those conversations now as a worst-case scenario.  This might lead to pre-approved traditional exports under WTO rules.<\/p> <p>  There is also the option of mutual recognition agreements negotiated by the Commission.  The Commission would probably not look very kindly on us seeking those in advance of Brexit, given that it will negotiate directly with the UK as well.  Tactically, should we discuss the WTO tariff rate quotas with the UK at this stage?  Should we speak with the Commission about mutual recognition agreements in order to set out our stall.  It seems there will be a WTO arrangement for a period after Brexit so we should not lessen the impact on trade.

I have a couple of brief questions for the witness.  In the main, we have spoken about the challenges of Brexit.  Are there agricultural opportunities for us?  How best can we challenge or take advantage of the opportunities?<\/p> <p>  As for the timeframe, the Prime Minister has indicated that she will trigger Article 50 before the end of March.  A two-year process will follow but as we all know, it may take longer.  Since the people of the UK voted on 23 June last, there has been a great deal of uncertainty.

I have no good news on that front.  In terms of a timeframe and regarding uncertainty, the first of 12 principles mentioned by the Prime Minister today was a need for certainty.  It is clear that we are into a negotiation on the initial phase of Article 50 that may last 18 months, if things go well.  There will be a need for at least six months for ratification etc.  One can imagine that there will be many occasions during that period when the newspapers will get hold of a leaked statement claiming the two sides are at loggerheads and headlines proclaiming talks will collapse or Britain will walk away without an agreement or whatever.  The foreign exchange will react to such news.  I agree with the Chairman that we will face an uncertain period.  From an Irish point of view, it is key that we set out what we think are the best negotiating outcomes.  During the negotiations we must focus on those outcomes and not be swept along on the tide of public opinion.<\/p> <p>  The EU negotiating position was mentioned by Senator Mulherin and others.  I think it is a balancing act.  From an Irish point of view we would like to retain close trading links with the United Kingdom, which is in our interest.  She put her finger on the difficulty by asking what is the point of membership if the UK is given too favourable a deal.  She wondered what differentiates membership from being on the outside but having all of the advantages.  It is probably in our interest to keep the UK as close to us as possible.  It looks like we will not be able to keep the UK in the customs union and it also wants to leave the Single Market.  In terms of the free trade agreement, however, Ireland wants to try to retain tariff-free trade.  That is where the impact of the industrial lobbies in the other member states may help us because they also will try to ensure that no new trade barriers are erected.  I warn that there is a precedent in these kinds of trade agreements for the agriculture and food sectors to be treated somewhat differently and not necessarily covered by the same general arrangements.  We may need to watch that we do not end up with less favourable arrangements for the food and agriculture sectors but a good deal on cars, which obviously would not help us.<\/p> <p>  The following two issues also were raised.  Can we argue that Ireland is more exposed to the adverse effects of Brexit than other member states?  If so, can we seek financial assistance from the EU budget?  This is important and is worth thinking about.  There are some arguments that we might find it difficult to do that, with one being that Ireland is a relatively rich member state, particularly after the revaluation of our GDP in 2015.  While it has not really affected us in our pockets, the statistics indicate that Ireland still is one of the richer member states.  If one of the responses to Brexit is to try to provide assistance to firms to enable them to diversify their exports to the EU market, then other member states obviously might not be that happy.  The Dutch and the Danes also will be seeking alternative markets if the UK opens up to the Brazilians, New Zealanders etc. in a much bigger way than at present.  Member states will question why Irish exporters get assistance while they do not.  As the implications of Brexit become clearer, it will be worth making the case to the Commission to argue for transitional support.  The Irish Government may want to provide support and the EU may provide co-funding.  It is important that we at least make the case for support.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid that I have no expertise in the fisheries sector and must pass on the question.  I recognise that fisheries is a huge issue. <\/p> <p>  I have mentioned that the issue of tariff-rate quotas, TRQs, might be important if we end up with the British withdrawing after two years without a trade agreement in place.  In other words, TRQs are irrelevant if we have a free trade agreement because we would have full access without tariffs.  TRQs are a fallback position if, after two years, the unthinkable situation occurs and we are trading with the UK on these so-called WTO terms.  There would be no point in raising that question once the tariffs are in place.  Clearly, we would need to negotiate with the United Kingdom if it began to look as if, for procedural reasons or negotiating reasons, a free trade agreement was not possible.<\/p><p>That would be the context in which tariff rate quotas may play a role but they are not one of the immediate issues because clearly we would hope that we could retain duty-free access through a free trade agreement. <\/p><p> Mutual recognition agreements are different because they will be necessary to avoid some of the negative consequences of the UK leaving the Single Market.  We know that is going to happen, so we know that we need to put in place mechanisms whereby both sides will agree to recognise inspections, approvals and so on done by the other side.  This does not only affect the food industry.  As can be seen if one looks at the most recent report from the House of Commons on Brexit earlier this week, which entailed meeting business people in the north of England, it affects, for example, the pharmaceutical industry.  They will be unclear as to whether their products can be sold legally in the European Union the day after Brexit because they will not necessarily have the clearances and certificates they will need unless there are some mutual recognition procedures in place.  It is not only food that will be affected by this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The mutual recognition agreements obviously need to be in place before Brexit happens.

As this is the committee's first opportunity to begin to look at this issue, I thought it might be useful to highlight the timeline as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that the Commission has indicated in its annual work programme that the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development, DG AGRI, should &ldquo;take forward work and consult widely on simplification and modernisation of the Common Agricultural Policy\".  DG AGRI seems to be taking this as an open-ended invitation to consult on the possible changes to the CAP in the period after 2020.  It has promised a public consultation, which I understand may take place over a three-month period launched towards the end of February.  Based on the responses to that, there then will be an impact analysis of the different options.  The Commission will come forward with three, four or five different options and will look at the implications of those.  Then, towards the end of the year, we might expect a communication setting out its preferred options and the reasons for its choice.  There will obviously be reactions to that, including from the Council of Ministers and from the Parliament, which eventually, possibly in the spring of next year, would lead to legislative proposals from the Commission.  As everyone is aware, there is a particular timing issue in that the current Parliament probably will have its last sittings in the spring of 2019 while the Commissioner will be there until October 2019.  Whether there would be enough time for the co-decision process to allow any firm conclusion to the discussion that might begin next year is an open question.  While there will be a lot of discussion, whether it will actually result in legislative changes is something which the committee might want to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  Second, I will comment very generally on the types of issues I would expect to see raised in the public consultation and in the impact assessment.  I have grouped these under the three headings we were familiar with from the last CAP reform.  There certainly will be economic issues.  Here I would expect discussion on measures to help farmers better manage price and market volatility, to strengthen the competitiveness of EU agriculture and to improve the position of farmers in the food chain.  The Commissioner has promised to try to persuade his colleagues, particularly in the Directorate General for Competition, to come forward with proposals on that issue, but it might well be wrapped into a more general reform of the CAP.<\/p> <p>  We then have the environmental heading, which of course was a key change in the last CAP reform with the introduction of the greening payment.  There is quite a discussion as to whether this has been an effective instrument to achieve environmental improvement and we will see some discussion on that.  We will also see the importance of the climate agenda, both in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and perhaps in looking at the role of agriculture in terms of sequestering carbon and contributing to renewable energy.<\/p> <p>  Then you have the social dimension, where we will see a focus on young farmers, generational renewal and more broadly, as part of the Juncker priorities, the creation of jobs and economic growth in rural areas.  It will be a very broad-ranging public consultation and it will raise all the issues followed very closely by many members in the last CAP reform.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight some of the changes in the political context.  The first is that, since the last reform, the EU has signed up to the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs, and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which includes climate.  The Paris climate agreement can be seen as the first step in implementing the climate goal in those SDGs.  The Commission is taking this very seriously.  In the last reform we were trying to fit the CAP into the Europe 2020 strategy, which was the overarching strategy of the time.  I think for 2030 it is very much these sustainable development goals.  That will mean more emphasis on environmental issues than we have seen in the past.  There is a concern, not least in the light of Brexit, to try to show that whatever the EU is doing contributes to EU added value and that it is not trying to replace activities and policies which member states themselves could better implement.  It is a question of whether it is possible to demonstrate that what we do in agriculture is contributing to European added value and is not simply substituting for what member states do. <\/p> <p> The Commissioner has made simplifying the CAP his main objective in his term of office.  It is extremely difficult, because agriculture and land management is complicated.  The committee is aware of that.  We can have different views as to how successful simplification has been but it is certainly going to be a recurring motive in the next reform.<\/p> <p>  Then of course the fourth issue, which we have already touched on, is the budget and how much money may be available. <\/p> <p>  The final part of the statement was really just to draw the attention of the committee to a report which I had prepared for the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  It is one of three reports.  The other two looked at the Common Market organisations and at rural development.<\/p><p> I was asked to talk about the future of direct payments.  I summarised some of the conclusions from that report, which was designed and help the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to identify some of the key issues.  We can take it from a rather conservative position, one where we roll over the existing CAP structure with its two pillars, the greening payment and the direct payments, and even there I think we will see a number of issues which were quite contentious on the previous occasion.  These issues include the external convergence, which is the expectation of the newer member states that their payments will continue to increase up to the average level.  This has implications for the internal convergence, which is the question as to whether we should have a uniform payment across all farms.  This was very contentious in Ireland in the last reform.  There was a link made between the internal convergence formula and the external convergence formula, so if one is changed in the next reform, we might expect the other to be changed.  The question was asked whether the capping of payments, which really has had no serious impact, will be reviewed?  Even taking a very conservative view, there are some quite contentious issues which I think will be addressed.<\/p><p> There are those who would like to go further.  Some people point to what has been happening in the United States.  In their last farm bill they actually eliminated direct payments.  They were the first to introduce them, but they eliminated them and decided instead to put the money into what they call their farm safety net.  This comprises two main policies.  One is counter-cyclical price support and the other is crop insurance, which despite its name actually covers some livestock products too.  I would not recommend taking the route of counter-cyclical payments.  We could discuss whether that is a good idea or not.  In terms of the broader issue of risk management and insurance, it is worth looking at whether that has the potential to help farmers to manage risk better.  I am a little bit sceptical.  I think that farmers prefer to self insure, to use their savings or to draw on bank credit and tax averaging schemes to manage variability.  There may well be a role for strengthening risk management instruments.  The Commission has emphasised in particular this income stabilisation tool, so maybe that is something which should be further pursued.<\/p><p> Some of the committee members may not be surprised to hear me say that, although I am extremely aware of the fact that direct payments are very important to many farmers, I have never been a great fan of them.  Looking at it partly from a taxpayer point of view but also from a farmer's point of view, I find it hard to justify paying a decoupled area-based payment per hectare of land without any evidence of return.  I realise it will be controversial, but I have suggested that we would be better off, in a sense, taking some of that money and putting it into more targeted payments where we set out some objectives we want to achieve.  These could be environmental objectives, risk management objectives, improving competitiveness or helping farmers address the climate challenge.  It is to have more targeted payments rather than these generalised area-based supports which benefit the larger farmers within the Union because it is paid on a per hectare basis, and the more hectares one has, the more support one gets.  At the end of the statement I summarise some of the principles which I recognise would be quite controversial, but perhaps I will leave it at that, and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the professor.

On the last points made by the professor, certainly for many farmers in Ireland, the intensification of agriculture has meant that fewer farmers are farming the land.  I have always felt that the Irish model, and to some extent the British model, where there is the family farm and livestock are free to roam and are grass fed, is unique.  We have those advantages.  I feel that in terms of an EU agricultural policy, every effort should be made to protect and enhance that, because it is a key thing.  It is also what European consumers want.  Whatever reform emerges should be focused on ensuring that emphasis is put on the smaller holdings, the family farm and that type of production unit.<\/p> <p>  I understand what Professor Matthews is saying regarding payments per hectare.  It is hard to envisage anything that will work for the farmer that is not a payment per hectare.  That is the problem we have.  It would be interesting to tease that out.  I understand that in CAP there is the environmental sector, the greening measures and all that stuff, which many farmers avail of.  However, many farmers also find that the red tape that comes into it can cause a huge degree of frustration for them, because they feel they have to jump through many hoops to get a relatively small amount of money.  Certainly where I come from, it pushes them into a position where they end up abandoning the farm, planting the land and stopping working it.  It is a tragedy, because it is a permanent change of land use, and it means that that land will never be used for productive farming again, and there will never be a community living in that area again, because it is such a low labour intensive form of production.  If CAP reform is to work from an Irish perspective, it has to be about delivering the maximum payments to the family farm and the farmer who is on the most marginal land.  If we are going to try to do that, I would be interested in hearing the views of Professor Kelly as to how an alternative to hectare-based payments might work, because he said if it was not on a hectare basis, it could be more targeted.  If it could work, I would hope that it would give the Irish farmer an advantage which he or she does not have at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#L00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his presentation.  I have crossed swords with him before regarding his views on the single payment, and it will be no different on this occasion.  This is the biggest challenge in terms of direct payments that we have faced as a country since the introduction of the MacSharry reforms.  I would like to make a number of observations.  We talk about what benefit it has for the country, but European consumers are paying less and less as a percentage of their disposable income for the food they consume.  That is a serious issue that we have as European farmers.  The reality is, without the single farm payment, the vast majority of our farmers would not be able to survive.  With regard to farmers on marginal land, the truth is that all farmers are under pressure.  There has to be some recognition in this reform of farmers who are earning their income from full-time farming.<\/p><p>We have a significant number of farmers who can survive without an off-farm income, but those who are farming full time will have to be recognised this time around.  One can introduce and operate caps, but if there is not some recognition of off-farm income, it will be extremely unfair.  That is something that has been overlooked when we have talked about caps and targeting payments at different areas.  The full-time farmer will have to be recognised more in this reform.<\/p><p> I would like to ask Professor Matthews a number of questions about his view of various aspects of the arguments that will be made in the next few months.  The cornerstone is that it is an historic payment dating back to the period 2000 to 2002.  Will it be able to survive this round of negotiations?  Should it survive?  A lot of people who have entered the industry engage in completely different farming practices.  That is a fundamental point and it is where we are starting from.<\/p><p> There is an ongoing review of areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments and how the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is to be protected.  Will it be protected and what percentage of the budget will be devoted to it?  It is a hugely significant payment for this country.  Virtually three quarters of our land is in areas of natural constraint.  What impact will the review have?  <\/p><p> I seek the professor's view on a matter related to the budget.  Some 38% of the EU budget is devoted to agriculture in the form of the CAP.  However, with the British decision to leave the European Union and a European Parliament that does not have a friendly disposition towards the CAP, what is the professor's realistic expectation of the percentage that will be spent on the CAP following the review?  Considering the external convergence from eastern European and the internal convergence at home, will there be virtual parity per hectare when the negotiations are concluded in 2020?  What will be the economic consequences for the country?<\/p><p> I would like the professor to expand a little more on a point that was made in an earlier contribution.  He criticised the changes made by the United States of America in eliminating farm payments, but he believes what has been introduced will not work in the medium to long term.  As what happens in the United States has a habit of happening here half a decade later, I would like the professor to expand on why he thinks what has been done in the United States is not in the best interests of the industry there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#L00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews for his presentation and insights.

As pointed out by Deputies Jackie Cahill and Gino Kenny, a significant proportion of income, or almost all for farmers involved in some sectors, comes from farm payments.  Therefore, the stakes are very high in terms of how much will be included in the budget and how it will be distributed.  Unless it is maintained to a significant extent, it will sound the death knell for a number of family farms.  It is crucial, therefore, that we achieve a good outcome.

I thank the Deputies for their questions.  I will make a preliminary statement.<\/p> <p>  Given that the direct payments are so important, particularly for beef and cereal farmers, I certainly hope changes would not take place overnight such that we would be thinking of what happened in New Zealand, for example.  I will come back to Deputy Jackie Cahill's point about direct payments being the cornerstone of the MacSharry reforms, but it is hard to continue to find justification for direct payments.  It would be better to plan for that change and try to look at what we might want to see put in place, rather than put our heads in the sand and simply say we have clearly benefited from these benefits in the past and want to hold onto them because clearly we do not want to give them up.  I can completely understand this.  I think we need to take into account the budgetary context.  This is the first question that has been raised about what the impact might be on the budget, but I would not like to put a figure on it.  I believe, however, that the budget will be smaller simply because I see the European Union being concerned about the other challenges of migration, security and, to some extent, job creation, although it can be argued that agriculture and the food industry will play a role in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The European Commission will come forward by the end of this year with its initial proposals in respect of the next multi-annual financial framework.  Some voices argue that it should be brought forward sooner because if Brexit takes place in 2019, perhaps we will need a revised financial framework as and from 2020 rather than, as we now expect, 2021.  There are suggestions we should simply roll over the existing medium-term budget because of the timing problem, with European Parliament elections due to take place in 2019.  It may well be difficult to get it through before it breaks up.<\/p> <p>  People see value in the maintenance of the family farm and smaller farms.  Recognising this, if we can try to quantify or identify that value, can we support the activities engaged in rather than the size of the farm?  I am not a great fan of supporting farms simply because they are small.  I think Deputy Jackie Cahill is absolutely right in that regard.  Small farms differ enormously in terms of their income and many farmers have an outside income.  That is one of the reasons I do not think capping direct payments would provide for greater equity because the income position of such farms is very different.  Because they are small and less intensive, can we actually make payments to support their involvement in more extensive farming?  I would see this as a targeted payment.  I am not worried if a farm is small or large.  If a farmer is farming more extensively and producing more - it could be bio-energy if engaged in forestry - that is something the public can recognise and would be willing to support, as opposed to giving him or her a payment per hectare without requiring a return, although I know that there are cross-compliance conditions attached.<\/p><p> There is not really any evident return to the taxpayer from that per-hectare payment.  If the farmer is involved in a short supply chain, supplying the local farmers' market, for example, and we could support that directly, not the fact that the farmer is small but that he or she is doing something the consumer wants, I would see a value for payments.  That is why I am a great supporter of the Pillar 2, which provides us with a framework.  I would like to see it enlarged and strengthened because it gives us more flexibility to provide these targeted payments.  I understand the reluctance to see land moving out of farming into forestry, which is probably the most likely land use but we do have a policy objective to increase the rate of planting.  It has a role in helping us meet our climate targets.  The planting carried out now is more environmentally sensitive than was the case in the past when there were acres of conifers.  I can completely understand why people objected to that.  I have walked in the forests of Denmark, which date from the 19th century when there was a replanting scheme.  The German forests also date largely from the 19th century.  They are replanted forests.  I look forward to the day when we could have a larger forest stock.  I realise there are different views on that but I am more positively inclined to see it as an option.<\/p><p> The key point is in the question about the decoupled payments.  They were not initially decoupled, they were partially coupled under the MacSharry reform and were decoupled a decade later under the Fischler reform.  They were introduced to compensate for that price reduction.  We need to rethink the basis on which we are asking the taxpayer to continue to provide that transfer to farmers.  We are maintaining land and landscape in difficult farming areas.  I have absolutely no problem in supporting payments for areas under natural constraint.  We are doing things for the environment, protecting biodiversity, habitats and so on, which is absolutely a clear case for support.  That is the direction I would like to encourage people to think about moving.  It will be more difficult to maintain the area payments.  That is not to say that farm groups will not fight to do that.<\/p><p> Earlier, we discussed what UK agricultural policy might look like after Brexit.  It will be interesting if the UK follows through on what many of us felt was likely to be the case, it is going to be an interesting case study to put it mildly, how farmers respond in a situation with lower support.  There is a case that at least a fair proportion of the direct payments leak out of the sector.  There is no doubt that conacre rents and the price of rented land are higher because people know there are direct payments they can access.  I am pretty sure input costs are higher than they would be if we did not have the direct payments.  There are ways in which the agricultural sector would automatically adjust to lower payments over time and given the space and time to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The advent of mega-cities is causing a migration problem - for example, in Dublin.  I am from Mayo where, like Donegal and Sligo, the statistics show migration of people to the cities.  In developed countries where the concept of the family farm has been lost, there are ranches and loss of population.  In developing countries there is no regard for the farmer.  I know there are issues for the farmer as producer, the price he gets in the food supply chain and the problems we have here.  Much of the money given out in direct payments does not satisfy people.  It just keeps them ticking along.  We need to consider, in the larger global context, how to have viable communities in rural areas because people in such areas do not really want handouts.  We always suffer from the problem of critical mass and it becomes part of a vicious circle.  We lose more people and then we must ask whether it is worth investing in areas such as those to which I refer.  There are many opportunities but support is required or else we will continue giving crumbs to farmers.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about rural development.  As a country that has strong rural traditions, we could develop some formula that could be applied elsewhere because the massive loss to rural areas is a worldwide issue.  Do we value them?  People cannot live on fresh air and the CAP is intended to secure food supplies - there are also environmental concerns - but do we want more than that for rural areas where people do not want handouts?  This is a much bigger question than just tinkering around with cuts here and there.  For individuals on low incomes, those making no money apart from what they receive from direct payments or individuals who are losing money as a result of the price of commodities, a small cut per week is a major issue.  We have a golden opportunity to try to arrive at a formula.  I do not know if there is an appetite to do so, however.  I can only see it going in the same direction.  It will be more depressing to be a farmer.  We will lose young people, a way of life and food quality and all our great ambitions will be dashed.<\/p> <p>  Much of the global political upheaval arises from too much emphasis on economy yet we cannot enjoy many of the pleasures, the leisure and lifestyle we have without economy but somehow people think we are bowing at the altar of our being economic units and we do not get the balance right.  The CAP could provide an opportunity to inquire as to what is our vision for rural Ireland and to do something right in respect of it, rather than just giving people crumbs to keep them going until the next crisis.  We seem to be always playing catch-up.  We could do more and do something for our country, respect the cities and the rural areas.  We need to take the pressure off the cities.  They cannot cope.

The opening point of CAP reform is not always where the end point is.  We saw during the most recent CAP reform that the then Commissioner had very radical proposals but that the eventual outcome was totally different.  We must bear that in mind.  In addition, the main difference on this occasion will be the budget.  It will determine exactly where we will go.  Perhaps my observation is wrong but, in my opinion, the budget will probably be an indication of where we will go in future CAP reforms, even beyond the current one.  There is continuous downward pressure on the budget.  Professor Matthews made a point earlier about the condition of farmers in this country, what is coming down the line and the decrease in funding available.  This may have a knock-on effect in a positive way.  For example, as Professor Matthews rightly mentioned, the price of conacre, fertilisers and inputs is a huge issue in this country.  There is no doubt that conacre has got out of control in recent years, possibly as a result of the cheque in the post that will come sooner rather than later.

I will respond first to the question on the US policy and why I was not too enthusiastic, particularly about its countercyclical payment aspect.  This is for a number of reasons.  First, it would be a step back to relating support directly to production, from which we moved away.  It would require support again to be linked to products.  There would certainly be difficulties in fitting it into the EU budget structure, which, as we know, is rather inflexible because it is set for seven years, although there are ways of moving money between headings.  It is not an easy structure in which to try to manage a countercyclical payment policy whereby one will, by definition, have a large expenditure in one or two years when prices are quite low and, when prices go back up again, zero expenditure.  Managing that countercyclical payment in the context of a relatively inflexible EU budget would be a challenge.  Furthermore, prices fluctuate because they are a signal indicating that farmers and consumers need to adjust.  If prices go down, it means there is oversupply, and if we prevent that signal going to farmers by telling them they will get this guaranteed price in any case, we will simply shift the adjustment onto the rest of the world.  There is an aspect here of our interest in developing countries which, I feel, also argues against countercyclical policies.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of the farm safety net is, as I said, risk management, that is, helping farmers to manage risk.  One of the issues on which we have some evidence here is that because in the past European agricultural policy provided much of this risk management through the market mechanisms - variable import levies, export subsidies, intervention, support and so on - it meant that private initiatives never developed to the same extent as they did in other countries, simply because we had these public support mechanisms in place.  In the academic literature we refer to this as the public mechanisms crowding out the private initiatives.  When the public mechanisms were slowly withdrawn, and as we became more market-oriented in our Common Market mechanisms, we were slow to see the emergence of private replacements.  It is only this year, or perhaps last, in the dairy industry that co-ops are offering fixed-price contracts to farmers.  This should have happened years ago as a way of sharing a risk.  There are opportunities to try to consider more private initiatives, perhaps with the support of some public funding.  As I said, I am still not fully convinced farmers will see this as a really attractive option in terms of buying insurance to stabilise their incomes.  As I said earlier, they may prefer to continue to do this on an individual basis, but I am certainly open to the idea that we should put more effort into considering this through pilot schemes and trying to assess the appetite of farmers for enrolling in these kinds of income stabilisation measures.  We could consider that part of the American system.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, the decoupled payments were a great improvement on what went before, and I am certainly not arguing that we should move back to the past.  However, the next step is to try to argue that there is a case for making transfers to farmers, that they do provide services other than food and that they should be rewarded for this.  It is a question of trying to see how we can target the payments.  That is really the message I am trying to get across.<\/p> <p>  The issue relating to beef is difficult.  People refer to the suckler cow herd as the national asset.  I have difficulty seeing this as the case.  It is clear that we will continue to produce beef and that we will have a dairy herd and beef coming from that herd.  The suckler herd is one of the few options for farmers in more marginal areas.  It is not a very efficient system, as we know.  I worry about the argument that to break even and give oneself a margin of &euro;200 per cow, we need a price of &euro;4.75 per kilo for beef, which is equivalent to almost another subsidy of &euro;200 per cow, which I see some people seeking, when the industry is already surviving simply on the basis of the payments.  Therefore, to say that the future of the industry is to give another &euro;200-per-cow subsidy is simply not the way forward.  I am an economist, not a livestock expert.  However, I am of the view that we probably need to go back and consider more extensive systems, which probably means larger farms - larger not necessarily in terms of economic size, but in terms of area - if our stocking rates are lower, and lower-cost systems.  I do not see us getting a market price of &euro;4.75 in the near future - not with Brexit and the way markets are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017011700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Surely, however, markets go against low-cost systems.

As the committee is well aware, this discussion is not simply about numbers.  More importantly, it is about the provision of funding to deliver vital public services for our citizens and to invest in infrastructure.  These services are delivered by over 300,000 public servants working in a number of Government Departments and agencies, a total of 41 separate Votes which are subject to approval by the D&aacute;il.  My last engagement with the committee was prior to the publication of the 2017 Estimates and I thank it for its valued contribution to that process.  Since budget time, there have been a number of developments which I will outline to give a brief sense of the scale and changes made to the funding of services.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure report of 2017, which was published at budget time, revised the projected total gross voted expenditure for 2016 to &euro;56.149 billion, which was an increase of &euro;310 million or 0.6%.  This reflected additional capital expenditure which was outlined in the mid-year expenditure report and provision for a social welfare Christmas bonus less anticipated offsetting savings across Government Departments.  These additional expenditure amounts were reflected in the Supplementary Estimates that were considered and agreed by the D&aacute;il in December.  We operate a cash-based accounting system and, as the committee will appreciate, given the scale of resources involved, which was some &euro;56 billion in 2016, there are timing and other budget management issues that mean it is difficult to be precise about the final spending position.  So for 2016, the actual gross voted expenditure outturn is reflected in the end of December Exchequer returns, which is &euro;55.981 billion. This is 0.6% lower than the gross expenditure allocation including Supplementary Estimates and is a very minor variation and very similar to previous years.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to 2017.  The 2017 Revised Estimates proposes total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58.07 billion, which is an increase of &euro;43 million, or 0.07%, over the amount set out in the expenditure report of 2017.  This increase reflects a number of post-budget technical and policy adjustments.  The increase in the 2017 Estimate over the 2016 Estimate, including Supplementary Estimates, is &euro;1.7 billion, or 3.1%.  When the 2017 Estimate is compared with the 2016 outturn the increase is &euro;2.1 billion, or 3.7%.<\/p><p> Last October, I announced a spending review, which will take place in advance of budget 2018.  While moderate, sustainable expenditure growth is now planned over the medium term, there are increasing and competing public service demands emerging.  The intention is that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options within the budgetary process by creating fiscal space for funding new policies from within existing ceilings through a systematic review of the existing cost base.  In parallel with this process, my Department is continuing its works on planning the capital review, the outcome of which is expected to be published alongside the 2017 mid-year expenditure report.  The objective of the capital review will be to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and what can realistically be delivered over the remainder of the plan utilising the additional resources now available.<\/p><p> I want to mention the measure announced by Government today to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement following the Labour Court recommendations on Garda pay.  After discussions with union leaders, I recommended an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period 1 April 2017 to the end of August 2017, inclusive, for those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000, those who are parties to the Lansdowne Road agreement, and those who do not stand to benefit from the Labour Court recommendations issued in respect of the Garda associations.<\/p><p> The Government believes in the value of collective agreements and is taking steps to support the continued implementation of the Lansdowne Road agreement until a successor agreement can be negotiated following the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  A collective approach to public service pay is vital to our national interest as it provides for the stable industrial relations environment, which has been a pillar of our domestic recovery and restored international reputation.  These agreements deliver public service reform, secure productivity improvements and allow for strong fiscal planning where pay increases are negotiated fairly and budgeted for on a multi-annual basis.  This allows us to balance pay increases in the public service with other social priorities, including improvements in housing and health care.  Collective agreements, however, are not dead documents or static bargains, they have to be flexible and responsive to events.  <\/p><p> The Labour Court recommendation with respect to Garda pay provided for pay increases for a particular group of public servants.  The Government had to act to ensure that the benefits of a collective approach were not undermined and that the Lansdowne Road agreement remains in place.<\/p><p> In my opening statement I have outlined the expenditure outturn position for 2016, the Estimates position for 2017 and the Government's announcement to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement, which has a continuing key role to play in underpinning the continued sustainability of our public finances.  I have also summarised my Department's plans for the spending review and made reference to the capital review planning for 2017.  I look forward to working with all the members of the committee this year and would welcome their input into and questions on any of the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#C00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I apologise in advance for having to leave early as I have another commitment at 5 p.m.  I will start where the Minister finished on the issue of public service pay.  He made an announcement this morning of &euro;120 million of extra expenditure and immediately prior to Christmas, there was &euro;50 million expenditure for the Garda deal.  There are a few questions around that.  That &euro;50 million was split between &euro;25 million from the budget of the Department of Justice and Equality and &euro;25 million from the general budget.  Will the same formula apply across all Departments for the &euro;120 million extra expenditure that was announced this morning?  Can the Minister give a guarantee that services will not be affected in any way by the Garda expenditure allocation or the extra expenditure allocation announced this morning?  Is the &euro;120 million announced this morning included Revised Estimates for 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that \"pay increases are negotiated fairly and budgeted for on a multi-annual basis\" in relation to Lansdowne Road and we all agree with that, but what we have had in the past few months have been pay agreements on the hoof, to a certain extent, and since the introduction of the budget he has managed to find &euro;170 million effectively out of nowhere.  He said in his press conference that it will be found from general savings and efficiencies.  That is one very big sofa if it has &euro;170 million down the back of it.<\/p> <p>  The role of this committee is budget scrutiny and if &euro;170 million can be found on the hoof, that makes our job as a committee very difficult.  An independent budget office, the putting in place of which is our aim and which will be established this year, will surely not approve of that kind of action.  The Minister will not be able to do that under the new fiscal rules.  How will this or any Government envisage that kind of expenditure in light of the new fiscal rules environment and in light of us being empowered and able to do the job the Oireachtas has given us as a scrutiny committee?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister outline the process and timelines for the capital review and the spending review?  Before the Minister arrived, Deputy Cullinane proposed that we would do some work on the fiscal rules around capital expenditure.  Given the commitments the Minister has entered into and the spending commitments in the budget and subsequent to it, what will be the revised fiscal space, to use those dreaded words, for 2017, 2018 and 2019?  In the context of the Minister going down the road of having a capital review, where is the space within the existing fiscal rules for us to have an active and aggressive capital investment programme, which we all agree we need?  Given that those rules are so restrictive, has the Minister engaged with the European Commission around those rules?  Has he responded to their entreaties?  President Juncker and others have said that there needs to be flexibility?  Has Ireland engaged in that process of flexibility around capital expenditure?  We saw the director general of the HSE at the weekend look for an extra &euro;9 billion in capital expenditure for the health service.  I am sure if every other director general and Secretary General had the opportunity, they would be doing something similar.  <\/p> <p>  What is the Minister's expectation for the comprehensive spending review?  His predecessor would have completed that probably on two or three different occasions during his time in the Department or one would have hoped he would have.  In the context of the expenditure cuts that were engaged in during that time, one would assume that every cent was accounted for.  The Minister made the suggestion in his opening statement that he hopes out of the spending review to find additional resources for spending and for programmes, and to add to the fiscal space.  That is what I understood him to say.  Can he outline the timeline for the spending review and what kind of figure he has in mind that may be achieved from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#D00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will begin by responding to his questions on the spending review and I will conclude by answering his question on public service pay.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comprehensive spending review and the capital review, the process for each of them will be different.  In terms of the comprehensive spending review, we will identify a portion of Government expenditure by Government Department.  We anticipate it will be approximately one third of Government expenditure but we will pick that percentage of Government expenditure so that it is consistent with subheadings within that Department's Vote.  We will then review that expenditure against a different approach from what my predecessor would have done.  When Deputy Howlin was performing this role, he looked for cuts in the context of our being in the troika programme.  We have not commenced a process like this since the run-up to, or during, the crisis.  The objective of this approach is to examine efficiencies.  It will be to examine what objectives are set for an expenditure stream and to see how that expenditure stream delivers against those objectives.  It will be a rolling process that we anticipate will cover all of Government expenditure over a three-year period.  Any conclusions we have with respect to that third of Government expenditure that we cover in 2018 will be concluded in advance of budget 2018.  There will be a different process for the capital review.  I want to bring all that to a conclusion this year.  In line with the publication of the mid-term expenditure report, we will provide an overview of all current plans - capital expenditure programmes.<\/p><p>We will make an assessment of how much of the existing fiscal space remains unallocated and how much could be allocated for capital expenditure.  Even within the current framework we anticipate it will be approximately &euro;2.2 billion up to 2020 or 2021.  We will then make a choice in the second half of this year in respect of where that will go.<\/p><p> In parallel, it is my anticipation and hope that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, will complete his work on the national planning framework.  I hope that in the second half of the year his work will inform capital choices that we will make, especially in the area of transport and housing.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the fiscal space and the flexibility or lack thereof in respect of capital expenditure.  Under the current framework, assuming no change in our economic circumstances, following the allocation of over &euro;2 billion for housing there still will be between &euro;2 billion and &euro;2.3 billion.  This is based on the assumption of no change in our growth forecasts with regard to allocation against new capital choices.  That is why I want to bring the capital review to a full conclusion in the second half of this year, unlike the comprehensive spending review, which will be an ongoing process.  Then there is the question of flexibility on top of that.  Part of our capital review will include a review of the use of public private partnerships and off-balance-sheet activity to see what role they could play in future capital projects.  As I have said to the committee previously, I am cautious in that area because I have no wish to make an assessment about a particular project being off-balance-sheet only for it to change in two years' time and for the Minister or Government of the day to have to face tough choices regarding projects to which they have already committed.  I expect that in the second half of the year work in that area will be brought to a conclusion.  We are using the funding of housing projects as a pathfinder approach to bring to an end some of the debate on the matter in the European Union.<\/p><p> Reference was made to pay policy.  I do not accept that this is pay policy on the hoof.  If I was sitting before the committee in the second half of this year with the Lansdowne Road agreement disintegrating and sectoral disputes in full flow, the committee would justifiably be asking me why I did not take action at the start of this year to try to give the Government and the State the ability to ensure those things did not happen.  That is what I have done.  I have concluded negotiations with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The conclusion was issued today.  It makes the strongest possible commitment to the maintenance of industrial order for the remaining tenure of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  That is why I believe this is the right decision.  I believe that if we did otherwise not only would we face even more precarious prospects in the second half of this year, but we would either not be able to deliver a replacement to the Lansdowne Road agreement or, if we did negotiate an agreement, it would be dramatically more expensive and potentially unaffordable to the State.  That is why I have put this framework in place.<\/p><p> There was a question about identifying the funding to pay for it and reference was made to the work the committee will need to do to this year.  That is work I will need to do during this year.  I am confident in this regard.  Last year, I identified savings and efficiencies of &euro;168 million on top of maintaining service commitments for 2016.  That is what I intend to do for 2017 as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#D00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I wish to pick up on the Minister's response to Deputy Calleary on public sector pay.  This is not about the rights and wrongs of any policy choice made by a Minister; it is about respect for this committee, in the first instance, and a recognition on the part of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and, hopefully, the Minister for Finance, that we have work to do.  This is a new committee.  Our job is to scrutinise spending and decisions made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government.  Notwithstanding the rights and wrongs of the decision, &euro;120 million is a great deal of money; it is not small change.  The Minister says this can be achieved through efficiencies.  The Minister has a responsibility to come before the committee and explain to us what exactly is meant by that.  I imagine the Minister has been presented with papers by his officials on background information around how exactly that money can be saved and exactly what efficiencies he is talking about and in which Departments.  Is it across all Departments?  We have a right to that information and those papers.  If we are to be in a position to hold the Minister to account properly on the one hand and to help and assist on the other, then we must have the information promised to be able to scrutinise properly.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to &euro;120 million and said the saving can be achieved through efficiencies.  That is a cause of concern for me and possibly for others on this committee.  I am respectfully asking that any background information provided to the Minister with regard to how this money can be achieved is also given to us.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might also explain why the issue of equal work for equal pay was not dealt with.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned the need for industrial relations harmony and holding the line on the Lansdowne Road agreement and so on.  He will understand that at the heart of many industrial relations disputes in recent times has been the core issue of equal work for equal pay.  This relates to those who came into the system post 2011.  We have consistently asked the Minister and the Department to indicate how much it would cost to return to a single-tier pay structure to deal with this issue.  The Minister has been unable to provide us with the figures.  He has been unable to sign up to the principle of it or even give an indication that he will do it over a reasonable timeframe.  Again, I am wondering why this issue was put on the long finger.  It has caused tensions in classrooms, Garda stations and all manner of public sector workplaces because there is a two-tier parallel pay structure in place.  Why was that not considered when the Minister was examining the Lansdowne Road agreement?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to capital spend.  At the weekend an opinion piece by the director general of the HSE referred to the need for &euro;9 billion of increased capital spend in health care in hospitals.  The Cassells report refers to the need for billions more in capital spend.  We have a housing emergency.  Obviously, we need to build more houses and we need a great deal more capital spend on housing.  I do not see anything in what the Minister has said today to suggest there is any urgency from the Government when it comes to investing in these areas.  The Minister commented on how this was not about numbers but about people and services.  However, the Minister said as much against the backdrop of people in hospital trolleys in record numbers, a dire need to invest in our schools and third and fourth level infrastructure and the need for the State to build housing.  How does the Minister expect to be able to meet the capital demands that exist without more flexibility?  How we can do that and continue with the tax-cutting agenda that he started in the last budget on top of previous budgets?  I cannot see how the Minister can square the two.  When representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council were before the committee, they said the only way we could do it in reality was to increase taxes on those who perhaps can afford to pay more, where possible.  Obviously, the Minister is not in favour of that.  His party has set its face against it and is in favour of cutting taxes.  How is that possible in the face of what we now seeing with regard to housing, health care and other areas?  I have a supplementary question that I will put when the Minister responds, but I will take the Minister's responses first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There was a question on health expenditure.  By this year we will be spending &euro;3,200 per head on health expenditure.  This is a 5.4% increase above our highest ever point before that in 2009.  Not only is health expenditure at its highest ever level; in <i>per capita<\/i>terms it is higher than where we have been before.  At &euro;14.1 billion, the allocation is the highest that has ever been made to the health sector.  Where is that figure going?  It is delivering a 10% increase in the number of people employed in the health service compared with where we were during the crisis period.<\/p><p>Those are the figures in regard to what is happening with health expenditure.  It is the highest in terms of gross expenditure and the highest in terms of <i>per capita<\/i>expenditure, which I believe is a more appropriate way to measure these matters here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In regard to how we are looking to deal with capital expenditure, the Deputy is correct about the array of competing demands.  There is a whole array of agencies, stakeholders and interests across the country that are looking for additional capital expenditure.  The Deputy mentioned two of them and I mentioned the HSE.  In regard to housing, we have allocated an additional &euro;2 billion in health expenditure.  He did not touch on transport, on arts and heritage, on sport or on all the other areas that are competing for this funding.  The reason we are putting in place a capital review is to look at what choices we can make to expand capital expenditure and, within all that, see who would be the beneficiaries of it.<br\/><br\/>What I would say is different to what the Deputy has said is that, first, we need to pay for everything we commit to and, second, I believe we should move away from the approach of comparing the cash amount we are putting against capital expenditure with where we were at the peak, and instead look at what we want to get in return for it.  The capital plan we have outlined up to 2021-22 looks to increase capital expenditure as a percentage of national income up to 3.8% to 4% of national income, which is in line with the 50-year average for the country and in line with where many of our peer economies are at the moment.<br\/><br\/>In regard to public sector pay, the Deputy said it is not about the rights and wrongs of policies.  What it is about is making what are difficult choices that are not without risk, and trying to make a choice that gives the best possible prospect for us for 2017.  That is what I have done and why I am here today to be accountable to the committee, as I will be.  In all my considerations, at no point was I looking to be disrespectful to the Oireachtas or the committee.  I believe it was appropriate that we made a decision at the start of this year.  Across this year, through the various tools that are available to me, I will do everything possible to ensure the funding is put in place to do this while delivering against the other commitments we have.<br\/><br\/>I agree that &euro;120 million is a very significant amount.  Alongside that, however, it is 0.2% of what we have allocated for all expenditure within the State.  What I have judged would pose an even greater challenge to public service delivery in the second half of this year is the disintegration of a collective approach to public pay.  That is why I made the recommendation that was accepted by Cabinet.  While the Deputy is pointing to the difficulties, in the interests of balance we should make reference to the statement that was issued by ICTU today and the commitment it has made to the maintenance of the Lansdowne Road agreement.<br\/><br\/>In regard to equal work for equal pay, we will be looking to address such matters in the context of the Lansdowne Road agreement and what will replace it.  We will begin work on that, I hope, in the second half of this year.  I have two concluding points in this regard.  First, workplaces all over the country have employees who have different terms and conditions and different levels of salary, depending on the point at which they joined that workplace and the health and financial viability of their employer.  To make a big change in that regard is something that will have consequences for everybody else who joined the public service, not just teachers.  The only way the Government can deal with such a matter is in the collective approach to public pay that I am trying to maintain.  I would hope the Deputy also recognises the agreement we did make with the INTO and the TUI that made progress in dealing with the issue of new entrant pay for teachers, and was recognised as such by the INTO and the TUI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#E00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I have a small number of supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to be brief.

When I made my point that this was not about the rights and wrongs of his decision, I meant that sincerely.  My point was that, in terms of process, he has made an announcement that he can achieve &euro;120 million in efficiencies.  The first question is why that was not identified at budget time.  What people will reasonably ask is, if these efficiencies can be made, why were they not found earlier.  The Minister has a responsibility to not just say in broad, bland, general terms that we have found &euro;120 million.  I cannot explain to anybody outside this room exactly where 1 cent of that will be saved because the Minister has given us no information whatsoever.  We are the budgetary scrutiny committee yet I have not one scrap of paper in front of me which tells me where that &euro;120 million will be found.  That is the reality and it is the point I am making.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the capital spend, again, I do not think the Minister has addressed the point.  He said earlier that he and the Government are looking at the review of public-private partnerships and the possibility of more off-balance sheet options.  That is a tacit acceptance the fiscal rules are not working.  If we have to look at these types of mechanisms, and we have seen how they have backfired on the Government with Irish Water, I do not think it is the way to go.  To me, it is a recognition that these mechanisms have not worked.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made the point that this was not about comparing cash amounts and I have heard the Minister for Finance make the point a number of times that we should not focus just on how much we are putting into public services and that it is not about comparing cash amounts.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, makes that point here again today yet, nonetheless, that is exactly what he did in his response to me.  He talked about comparing the amounts of money that were put into the health service in the past when he said there is a record level of investment and so on - he is the one that made that comparison.  I am pointing out to the Minister the reality that whatever he might say about the health service and about how much is being spent, we have problems in regard to capacity.  More patients are being outsourced to private hospitals, there is more agency spend, there are missed targets in regard to people waiting to see consultants within 18 months and there are record levels of patients on hospital trolleys.  That is the reality.  When we have the director general of the HSE saying that &euro;9 billion is necessary over the next ten years, it should be a wake-up call.  I have heard nothing from the Minister to tell me that will be addressed in the short, medium or long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I do not need any encouragement to wake up.

I understand what is going on in different sectors of our health service but, cumulatively, as I said, what we have seen is an increase of just over 10% compared with where we were a number of years ago.  It is due to an understanding of the sectoral challenges that are faced, particularly within our health service, that we made an agreement with representatives of the nursing union in regard to the role of the student credit to try to address some of the issues we are facing in regard to the recruitment and retention of nurses.  We have done that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the specific points the Deputy put to me about capital spending, I have acknowledged the competing demands that exist. That is why I am reviewing the capital programme, despite the fact the programme is in existence less than two years.  I know that the context within which the plan was first founded has now changed, and that is why I am doing this piece of work.  Do I believe the fiscal rules are broken?  No, I do not.  Do I believe we should find ways of giving flexibility to capital expenditure?<\/p><p>The qualification for fiscal space, as the Deputy knows, already does that because it accrues capital expenditure in a different way to current expenditure when it occupies fiscal space.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said he wants to see whether further flexibility can be found on capital expenditure and we are doing work in that regard on housing to see if that can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#F00900","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I expect he probably had anticipated the backlash he is receiving from Deputies here today.  There is no criticism as such in giving a pay increase to a public sector worker and nobody is disagreeing with that aspect of it.  We, however, have a job to do.  If we go back as far as the budgetary process when we scrutinised Government proposals and put forward our own proposals, certainly all the Opposition parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the others, put forward budget proposals on the basis of figures provided to us on the assumption that they were correct figures and that they were all the figures that were available.  Moments before the budget was announced the Minister, Deputy Donohoe managed to find &euro;100 million.  At the time it was highlighted to him that Deputies were very unhappy with how that was done and we felt it undermined the budgetary process at that point.  Today the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has found another &euro;120 million and not so long ago he managed to find &euro;150 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Nobody is begrudging money going to public servants but the job we have to do as Opposition Deputies on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to put forward realistic alternative budget proposals to the public and to the Minister.  Because we are not operating on the same figures with which the Minister appears to be operating, it makes our job impossible and makes a mockery of the process.  We must take the Minister at face value when he says that he has found this &euro;120 million from savings and efficiencies - which is the term I believe the Minister has used.  As Deputy Cullinane has pointed out we have nothing before us to show where those efficiencies were made and we have nothing before us to tell the committee or the D&aacute;il when the Minister found out about these efficiencies.  When did the Minister become aware that he was going to have an extra &euro;120 million to play with?  On average it is working out at around &euro;4,000 annually to members of the Garda - and again nobody is begrudging that - I understand why it was done.  I appreciate the Minister cannot comment much on this aspect but clearly the difficulties facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the onslaught and threat of an unprecedented all-out strike, the pressure it brought to public sector pay, the whole discourse around that process and all the upset around that HR difficulty have led to increased pressure on the Minister to find money elsewhere for other sectors of the public service.  The Minister is telling us that he found this funding through efficiencies but it appears as though he found the money because he had no other choice.  He tells us that it will not affect other services but there is nothing before the Deputies to assure the committee that this is not going to happen.  The Minister speaks about the money going into the health services, for example, and that there has never been more money spent <i>per capita<\/i>in our health service.  However, the numbers of people on trolleys at Mayo University Hospital this year reached an all-time high - the highest in ten years.  If there is more money <i>per capita<\/i>going into the health service, where is it going?  Clearly it is not being spent on the patient and is not improving the level of service provided to our citizens.  I ask the Minister to take on board the issue of the undermining of the committee's work in the handling of this additional money being found and the lack of information coming forward to this committee to allow it to do its work.  I take the Minister at face value when he says he wants to be accountable to this committee and that he is not looking to be disrespectful in any way but he can appreciate, from our perspective, why there might be anger on this side as to the way things have been handled.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister could comment on a criticism the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has laid at the Minister's door on the trend for using temporary or volatile corporate tax receipts to pay for permanent services.  What are the Minister's views on this and what steps is he taking to reduce the risks associated with that?<\/p><p>My final point is on the pre-budget work done by this committee.  We heard presentations from various stakeholders such as the ESRI, IFAC and many others.  At that point in time - going on the original figures the Minister told us were available in the fiscal space - we were being told by every stakeholder that it was on the upper limits of prudent spending for this State for 2017 and that we were hitting the upper reaches.  Considering that we now have &euro;120 million, another &euro;50 million and then &euro;100 million at budget time, is the Minister concerned that he may have exceeded prudent spending for this year, thereby putting us at risk in our economic performance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#G00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers for her points.  I make a broad point that this illustrates the contradiction and challenge I face as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Everywhere I go I face demands for more public expenditure and frequently, in the same analysis, people then go on to accuse me of breaching fiscal rules and expanding fiscal space.  I must try to reconcile both together.  On the response given to me by the Deputy, which she is entitled to do, it strikes me that if the Lansdowne Road agreement had disintegrated or if a number of my Government colleagues were facing pay claims that all had unpredictable consequences for this year, then I would be facing a very different issue if I was before the committee in the second half of this year.  I will offer some perspective for those who have pointed to and criticised my response to the Labour Court recommendation on the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues.  Those who criticise my response to it were also the people who were calling for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to the Labour Court.  If I, as the Minister, had said the next day that I was not accepting that recommendation, then I would have fatally undermined the work of the Labour Court.  For an employer to not accept the Labour Court's recommendation is one thing but it is another for the employer as Government - which set up the Labour Court - to not accept the recommendation.  In so doing and definitively precipitating an environment in which the garda&iacute; would have withdrawn their services, the next day would have posed a different set of consequences for which I am certain I would have been in front of this committee.  Reference was made to how we are dealing with this issue.  Critics are accusing me of responding to this but they would then criticise me if in the second half of the year I was facing pay claims that were unknowable.  While there are risks with the approach I have taken, and I have acknowledged this, I believe in working with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and bringing clarity to a figure for this year.  It offers me and the Government the best prospect of dealing with the maintenance of industrial relations in the State for this year.  I ask Deputies to consider where we would be across the summer if we were facing a situation where momentum was building in the aftermath of Article 50 being triggered - we have a very difficult situation in Northern Ireland and a responsibility to play our role in helping to respond to that - and a situation in which public expenditure policy was unravelling because we were uncertain about what public pay would look like in the second half of 2017.  I have had to make a set of choices to deal with that.  This is the argument I make to Deputy Chambers about the proposal that was supported in Cabinet today.<\/p> <p>  As I do not want it to be uncertain to the committee, I will clarify one matter.  I do not state that I have identified savings or efficiencies and am not giving the figures to the Deputies.  That is not the case.  I am simply saying that the cost of this proposal is a very large amount of money, as I have acknowledged on a number of occasions, but it is in the context of the public pay bill of &euro;13.5 billion.  Were I to have the unknown that I had in respect to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across every aspect of that &euro;13.5 billion, I would face a massive challenge for expenditure policy for the second half of this year.  I have a process for how we are dealing with the issue and in how we can reconcile funding this expenditure while meeting other commitments.  I am more than happy to come back to the committee during the year to account for this process.<\/p><p> I will end on that note.  What would have posed a bigger risk in the context of delivering all the commitments the Deputy wants me to deliver are, in the context of a &euro;13.5 billion pay bill for the State, sectoral wage claims that will escalate in the second half of this year.  I do not wish that to happen, which is the reason I have been engaged in negotiations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions since early December.  We brought those negotiations to a conclusion very recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I have a follow-up question, and I will be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Did I miss a question from the Deputy on capital expenditure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I do not believe so.

While I take the Deputy's point about the consequences of that for the sustainability of public expenditure, I wish to make two points.  First, part of what put me in the situation I was in was honouring the agreement in the programme for Government and in the supply-and-confidence agreement with the Deputy's party, as I was committed to do.  Second, I am doing all of this in the context of the party I represent, which worked with Deputy Burton's party when she was T&aacute;naiste in the previous Government, continuing its work into this Administration.  We have seen the State's deficit come down from 11% of our national income, which is all we make and sell in our country, to the possibility of eliminating the national deficit within the next 18 months.

I have a few questions.  To return to the issue of Garda pay, I am glad that an agreement was reached.  It would have been incredibly unfortunate for the country if there had been a Garda strike, so it is welcome that an agreement was reached.  However, in the material I saw about the agreement and how the &euro;50 million is to be funded, I recall that &euro;25 million is to come from within the resources of the Department of Justice and Equality.  That struck me as being a fairy tale.  I would be grateful if the Minister would analyse this.  His Department is providing a certain level of support, understandably, out of buoyancy.  In these statements, there is a great deal of revenue buoyancy, which has covered many of the difficulties that the Minister undoubtedly faced.  However, in the context of any type of ordinary counting, will he please explain where &euro;5 million, &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million, &euro;20 million or &euro;25 million will be found for Garda pay from the resources of the Department of Justice and Equality?  To be honest, I do not believe what has been stated.  It is a fairy tale.  To return to the comments made about this committee, the Minister has a difficult job to do.  We have a difficult job as well but we will help each other if we can be on the level about some of the figures.  The Minister is not a magician, but he would need to be one to conjure up an extra &euro;25 million from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I would love to know the justice resources that would give up &euro;25 million.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the general principle of the expenditure reviews.  The history of expenditure reviews worldwide is fraught with difficulty.  There are the big beasts of public spending, which are social welfare, health, education and public service pay.  They account for a vast amount of the total public spend, and a huge proportion of that is money well spent.  I am anxious to know what the Minister means by efficiency and efficiency savings.  Obviously, there are certain areas where progress can be made.  One could try to cut down on fraud and clamp down on the black economy, which I believe is rampant again.  These are areas in respect of which savings definitely can be made.  The Minister's Department rides shotgun on the spending of all other Departments.  It has six years experience of doing this, so the Minister should by now be able to share with the committee, via his officials, where the likely efficiencies will be found.  There is one potential efficiency which I believe should be considered very carefully in the context of the type of economy we have.  I refer to outsourcing.  There are people in the Minister's Department who are very fond of the idea of outsourcing.  We have a Government that is dedicated to rural Ireland, as opposed to Dublin.  It is really quite hostile to Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>My God, that is news to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>It is not the Minister or me and certainly not some other people in this room but, based on reading the newspapers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I was not expecting that charge today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>One could base it on reading the newspapers.  If the Department is going to outsource, I must bring it to the Minister's attention that what is happening with outsourcing is a drift down to minimum wage employment and relatively poor conditions of employment.  The Department of Social Protection, in which I worked, has a huge amount of employment distributed throughout the country.  There are large amounts of such employment in places such as Donegal, Sligo and the north west, as well as in the rest of the country.  I seek reassurance from the Minister that this country-wide employment structure will remain largely intact.  We have seen what happened with the British social welfare system, which is very different from ours, and in the social welfare system in the North.  They have outsourced heavily, and disastrously so.  In case this is one of the bright ideas floating around for those savings, I ask that there not be an agenda around additional outsourcing.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on another area.  The Minister referred to demographics, which are terribly important.  Can he supply the committee with a broad indication of the demographic costs involved?  We know what they are in the context of younger children and a rapidly ageing population.  I do not intend to go into that now but it would be useful for this committee because it is not often understood.<\/p><p>We have this marvellous thing that the Germans do not have, a rising population, a huge population of children but with big costs in health and education as a consequence.  We also have an older population which is living longer, another great thing for the country but there is a pensions crisis.  How is the Department going to approach the pricing of those demographic changes which are both a bonus and a huge pressure on spending?  <\/p><p> In respect of the budget arithmetic, including the change that Deputy Chambers referred to, when a senior official told us an hour before the budget announcement that everything was \"nailed down\" &ndash; I think that was the term - there was a laugh around the committee because as we suspected, all the figures were subject to change.  What plans is the Minister putting into his expenditure proposals and reviews for the cost of Brexit?  The sterling rate in the budget arithmetic was assumed to be around 85 cent.  It has fluctuated quite dramatically since and is falling rapidly.  Many of us recall the mushroom growing firms in Monaghan and the midlands that closed overnight.  It will be necessary for the Government to put a plan in place for Brexit.  Is there a contingency plan?  In a certain sense Brexit will happen very slowly.  Will something be put into the plan?  <\/p><p> We need more figures on the child care initiative due to start in September because the provision for it seems very low for our child population.  It will be only three months of this year but in the context of buoyancy it is changeable.  I would like to know more about that and in fairness to this committee the Minister should give us more information.  <\/p><p> In respect of the health service, while I appreciate that &euro;14.1 billion is the highest figure ever, does the Minister really think the Department and its officials have a grip on spending in the health services in Ireland?  We are yo-yoing around very large changes in the figures in the budget season almost week by week.  In his statement the Minister says correctly &ndash; and I was a member of the Government involved in this &ndash; that the health expenditure went up by &euro;780 million in additional allocations.  That was followed, which has become the practice in the Health Service Executive, HSE, by the most recent statement, that it wants &euro;9 billion over ten years.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten.  I know this included capital but does the Department have a serious take on the finances of the health service?<\/p><p> Many extra managers have been employed recently in the health service.  While I know managers are necessary most people want to see that expressed in extra nurses, doctors, medical services and people with qualifications in that field.  In respect of the queues in accident and emergency departments in many parts of Dublin, and Deputy O'Connell could probably elaborate on this, there are very good services available at pharmacy level which are well positioned to take some of the pressure off people going to accident and emergency departments.  That does not, however, seem to be prioritised in any way.  Some of the quality services available in pharmacies in my constituency, the Minister's and that of Deputy O'Connell are absolutely excellent at providing people with information and reassurance for example, when children have cuts or grazes or adults have relatively minor complaints, such as the start of a cold.  This, together with community-based services, seems to be the way to go yet we do not seem to be over the threshold.  What does the Department do to monitor the health service budget?  I presume the &euro;9 billion has been accepted because nobody from the Department said it did not accept that figure.  Is it right?  Is this the private negotiation?  That is roughly an extra &euro;1 billion per annum.  It is a lot of money unless we have a lot of extra buoyancy.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance told us he was involved in negotiations on the terms of the fiscal rules.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform involved in them because unless we put serious capital investment into the capital region, as well as the rest of the country, we will not do as well as we could from Brexit by companies locating in Dublin?  I think we have a good chance of getting extra jobs out of Brexit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#H01000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will begin with health expenditure and then deal with the Deputy's points on pay policy.  I will fully answer the question on staffing because it is important to put this on the record.  In December 2013 there were 8,353 people working in the medical and dental sectors of our health service.  That figure was 9,692 in November 2016, an increase of 16%.  There were 34,169 nurses, there are now 35,795, an increase of 4.8%.  The figure for health and social care professionals, such as social workers and people who work in the community, was 12,400; it is now 15,300.  In management and administration there were 15,500 staff and there are now 16,700, an increase of 7.8%.  For general support staff, who support the running of primary care centres and hospitals, there were 9,786 in December 2013, there are now 9,415, a decrease of 3.8%.  In respect of patient and client care, there were 16,796 in December 2013 and at the end of November 2016 there were 19,874, an increase of 18%.  There were 9,808 more people working in our health and social services in November 2016 than in December 2013, an increase of 10.1%.  To paint a picture of numbers of people working in those services contracting is completely inconsistent with the figures for what has happened over the past three to four years.  Those are the figures.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question do we have a grip on health expenditure, the management of the health Vote probably occupies a fifth of my time.  I engage daily and constructively with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on this.  In respect of whether we have an assessment of this, after many years of difficulty in managing it and the Deputy will be well aware of those difficulties because she was party to some of them, I made an intervention last summer in advance of the health Estimate coming to the House and we absolutely expect that revised figure not to be overspent.  I have the same expectation for this year, in contrast with the terrible difficulties my predecessors have had to face in the management of that Vote.<\/p><p>It is one that justifiably attracts a huge amount of my focus and time, given the anxiety and fear people experience when difficulties arise with regard to delivery of the services.  However, to paint a picture of not being able to recruit or numbers decreasing is not the reality in terms of what is happening in those services.<\/p><p> Before I deal with the Deputy's specific points about where we are with public pay, and I will do my best to answer each of them, I want to again read into the record a section of the text we negotiated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I will paraphrase it to get to this point.  It states that this agreement is being offered by Government on the understanding that there will be continued adherence to the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement and, in particular, its mechanisms to resolve disagreements before they escalate into industrial disputes over the remaining period of the agreement.  It further states that the requirement to adhere to industrial peace will be fully observed in all sectors.  That is a joint statement by the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I need hardly tell the Deputy we were a long way away from that place in December.  I am facing challenges on which she is justifiably questioning me now in terms of how we got to this point but as I have said on a number of occasions, it is my assessment that the challenges I face now are different from the position I would be in if our pay bill became completely unpredictable and uncertain in the second half of this year.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has provided details to her counterpart in the D&aacute;il on the detail of the question Deputy Burton put to me.  I do not have the information with me.  However, I will ensure that the Deputy receives an answer to her query.<\/p><p> In terms of how I will manage to deal with all of this across the entirety of 2017, I am not committing to tax buoyancy at this point.  That is a decision for the Minister for Finance to make but I am making the point that the figure before us is less than the savings we accrued at the end of 2016 in respect of expenditure after I had met all the other commitments I had to meet.  While the Deputy was not party to all of this, I want to make the point that the process was a very difficult one of ensuring we could pass a budget for this year and trying to reconcile all the demands we faced.  What I will not wear, however, is being obliged to negotiate the passage of that budget through the Oireachtas in a way that is consistent with our fiscal rules and deficit targets for this year while - once I have secured the agreement to lead to it being passed - facing charges that the budget is in some way inconsistent with the fiscal requirements I must meet.  I am responsible for this budget and I was responsible for negotiating its passage through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> On the points the Deputy put to me in respect of outsourcing, she can rest assured that the level of enthusiasm I have for outsourcing is roughly the same as was the case when Deputy Howlin was running this Department.  Whatever role I can see regarding outsourcing will not precipitate any rush to the bottom in terms of wage levels or service levels.  I want efficiencies and value for the taxpayer but I am aware of my other obligations and I will do my best to meet those also.  That is one of the reasons collective agreements matter.  I have been at pains to say, both privately and publicly today, that collective agreements have benefits that flow both ways.  That has been a factor in the agreement we have reached today.<\/p><p> In the context of our assessment of the demographics, a detailed paper on that, which I will share with the committee, was produced by my Department.  We know that to fully meet the demographic pressures, particularly in education, our public service numbers would need to grow by approximately 3% per year until 2021, and education is a big part of that.  As this D&aacute;il develops and as we get into the passage of future budgets, which I am determined to see passed but everybody has a role to play in making sure that happens, that will become a far bigger factor.  It will be a factor when the Government publishes its Estimates on the fiscal space for 2018, which we will do in the mid-term expenditure update in the middle of this year.<\/p><p> Brexit is absolutely a factor.  In my capital review, in particular, and in the terms of reference I have agreed with my Department, Brexit is part of it.  I make specific reference to it and to the regional consequences of Brexit because I am aware that the north-west of our country is facing particular pressure in terms of infrastructure, and that will be exacerbated if we see very negative consequences from Brexit materialise.<\/p><p> That leads on to the accusation that we are in some way anti-urban.  I assure the Deputy, as somebody who lives a few minutes away from O'Connell Street and represents a constituency in the middle of Dublin adjacent to hers, that I see no evidence that this is a constituency that is in any way anti-urban.  Many of the decisions we are making in the area of public transport, for example, are with a view to trying to serve larger urban centres.  It is our larger cities, most notably Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, with their high concentrations of population, that will benefit from some of many decisions we have made in respect of housing.<\/p><p> With regard to the breakdown of expenditure for child care, we have made available an additional &euro;86 million for the roll-out of the extended child care scheme that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has announced.  That forms part of an increase of &euro;174 million for her Department, which, in percentage terms, was by some way the largest beneficiary of budget 2017.  I do not believe they are underfunded in any way but the Deputy is correct that this is only for three months of that scheme.  My understanding is that the target live date for that scheme was October 2016 and the full-year cost of that would then be taken into account in discussions I will have with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for 2017.  That will also feed into the expenditure report we will publish in the middle of this year.<\/p><p> Finally, I have already given my view on fiscal rules and how we take account of capital expenditure with regard to that but under the division of responsibilities that was carried forward into this Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has overall responsibility for that area as the person who sets the overall expenditure ceilings for Government.  He is leading the Government view on that matter but he is well aware of my views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#J00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I have a brief supplementary question.  To refer again to the urban-rural situation, there are a couple of reports in the Irish Independent today that a house restoration grant is to be made available for young couples in rural towns and villages.  In the areas the Minister and I represent, the cheapest option for many young couples in terms of getting their first house will be a second-hand house.  It is grossly unfair, and a poor policy, that if funding is given - which I do not have a problem with if the money is available - for properties in villages and towns in rural Ireland, it is wrong not to make something equivalent available when many young couples literally have a gap they cannot cross in terms of being in a position to both buy houses and then, particularly if they are buying second-hand properties, whether in urban or rural Ireland, to give these people some support in upgrading them.<\/p><p>The report was attributed to a scheme the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is to launch shortly.

That is what the report seeks to address.  Alongside that, areas with high population densities, which are concentrated in larger urban areas and cities, will be the main beneficiaries at the same time of improved public transport plans such as: Luas Cross City; the availability of more buses - for example, to Dublin Bus; and the potential for a high-capacity metro link.  Because of the lower population densities of other parts of the country, these facilities' equivalents might be available but the scale of investment is unlikely to be.

I say this with respect.  The Minister has a responsibility to do this.  He came before the predecessor of this committee, the budgetary arrangements committee, and talked in glowing terms about how the Executive and the committee need to work together.  This is it now.

The reason I have brought forward that proposal for &euro;120 million, and I am confident I will be able to identify that figure, is that because in previous years, leaving aside the issue of buoyancy and what happens in tax take, processes and work that my Department has done have yielded figures that are higher than that.  When I complete the work I am going to do across this year on how we will pay for this bill and the detail of how we will pay for it, I will be accountable to members and I will discharge that responsibility.

That is why I have made the decision to which the Government has agreed today.

Will this be in higher expenditure?  Will it be in the reallocation of expenditure?  Will it be in other choices that we make?  I will account for that across this year.  To conclude on this point, unless I deal with this now, my assessment is I will face larger risks and larger figures in the second half of this year.  While I will not read it out again, as the Deputy already has heard it, I read into the record of the committee the recommitment that has been made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, on industrial stability and the Lansdowne Road agreement.

The danger in all of that is to service delivery.  We have constituents and we know what is happening.  Unfortunately, in my constituency efficiencies in the health service meant that when people who had home help support passed away, that home help support was taken into the Health Service Executive and 50% of it was reallocated.  This meant people could not get out of hospitals or nursing homes and back into the community.  That is what are called \"efficiencies\".  Moreover, the non-recruitment of people into positions was deemed to be savings by the Department.  I just do not think it is credible.

If the entire public pay bill was to go down the route it faced the risk of going down towards the end of 2016, the figures the Government would be asked but would be unable to find would be many multiples of this.  They would be costs that would transfer into 2018, 2019 and 2020.  That is unlike the agreement that I have today.  One of the main reasons I am doing it, the Deputy has referred to the risks to service delivery, is that I am always doing this with a mind to those who depend on our public services.  It is my judgment that a very significant risk exists to service delivery in our country if collective agreements, the principle of which I believe Sinn F&eacute;in supports, are undermined.  I face that risk in the absence of this agreement.  That is why I have made the choices I have in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Across this year, I will respond to the Oireachtas as to how this matter will be dealt with.  I have outlined the options available as to how we will deal with it.  I am repeating myself but then again, so has Deputy Doherty in terms of the points he has put to me.  I believe the savings from the options available to me to generate this figure are equivalent to - and the figures that were delivered in the past, in 2016 in particular, are lower than - the cost of this agreement.  In the absence of this agreement, I would have faced a horizon of potentially hundreds upon hundreds of millions of risk for our public service pay bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017011700002#M00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>A key thing that this committee has to do is scrutinise policy positions prior to them being enacted.

Let me put the question to him again.  There is no doubt in my mind, or maybe he can tell me I am wrong, but that the Department has provided the Minister with a paper or a page to suggest from where efficiencies or savings can be gained within the public sector or within the public pay bill.  I am asking the Minister, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and I am not sure if members will endorse this request, to provide that to us in order that we can do our job and scrutinise what is now a budgetary measure.

Given how underfunded many areas are, such as health, they could do with a bit of upward flexibility and discretion but now they will not have it.  Extra revenues should have been raised through larger contributions in corporate tax, financial transaction tax, taxes on those with higher incomes and a landlord tax, as we proposed in our alternative budget submissions, to ensure some pay restoration.

As the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, one of the things we cannot detach ourselves from is the potential impact of unknown quantities being spent throughout the year on the budget.  I warmly welcome the proposal the Minister has brought forward.  I believe it is a proposal of common sense.  It brings forward basic clarity and gives a defined figure for a cost for the year.  It takes out that uncertain risk.  I have no doubt that there are hundreds of thousands of public sector workers throughout the country who are very pleased with this announcement today.  From a budgetary perspective, being able to put a figure on this at this point in the year and effectively to put a cap on it is something that we should welcome.  I commend the Minister on his work.  If we look back to last December, and this is a reference the Minister himself made, I do not think anybody here would have believed that we would have reached this type of agreement and understanding.  I am tremendously pleased that we are now facing into 2017 with the type of certainty that allows all the planning for the other aspects of the budgetary outturn during the year to be looked at in the knowledge of what that figure is.

By way of background, I will explain the role of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in terms of An Post.  The Department is responsible for the postal sector, including governance of An Post, to ensure the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.  Following a Government decision earlier this year, responsibility for the post office network and associated matters transferred to my colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I should also point out that operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the board of management of An Post.<\/p> <p>  The mail business is undergoing a profound structural change both here and internationally.  Electronic substitution has made significant inroads into the letters business while also providing opportunities for growth in parcels.  The trend is particularly apparent for large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  The trend, which has been evident for some years now, accelerated in 2016 and has resulted in An Post facing serious financial difficulties.  To give an example, mail volume decline, which was projected at 3.5% for 2016 at the start of the year, is now estimated to have reached 5.5% for the year as a whole, with this trend to continue and accelerate in 2017.  This outcome represented a doubling of the year-on-year volume decline and if this rate continues, volume decline could reach 50% by 2019 compared with 2007.  As the mail business generates approximately two thirds of An Post revenue, the scale of the decline is having a significant impact on company finances.  The other issue that impacted last year was a 2.5% Labour Court pay recommendation which has added &euro;8.5 million to payroll.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall that the challenges facing An Post were well set out by the chair of the company in his appearance before the committee in July 2016.  In addition, at the request of the Minister, NewERA has conducted an in depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Ministers and has confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing the company.  In light of the scale of the challenges facing the postal sector, the company has started a fundamental review with a view to identifying the strategic challenges and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing.  The Government fully supports this review and looks forward to the outcome which is expected in May 2017.  <\/p> <p>  One of the main elements of the postal service is the daily delivery of post to every address in the State.  The Minister recognises it is important that An Post has the capacity to continue to provide the service which is valued by communities in both urban and rural areas.  In addition, the company requires some financial headroom to undertake and implement the findings of the strategic review.  Recognising both imperatives, Government has agreed to bring forward legislation repealing the price cap mechanism in the 2011 Postal Services Act.  This will enable An Post to increase the price of the stamp and generate much-needed additional revenue.  As it stands, Ireland falls well below the European average in terms of stamp prices and it is expected that the proposed increases will bring the price in line with European norms.  The Minister is cognisant of the impact such a measure might have on consumers and the SME sector.  Therefore, the Bill also provides that the Commission for Communications Regulation will undertake a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap after a two-year period.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months after the commencement of the review and the Minister will lay the report prepared by ComReg before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In addition, provision is made to enable ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out the review.  It is important to emphasise - the Minister is very keen to make this point - that despite the difficult financial situation, there was no threat to the mail deliver or the universal service obligation.  An Post will continue to deliver post to every address every working day.  This amended approach to pricing aims to ensure that An Post can continue to fulfil this obligation.  Once again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and am happy to take questions on the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Our second witness is Mr. William Parnell, assistant secretary at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#E00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  I welcome the opportunity to address the committee as it considers matters related to the post office network.  The interest of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the post office network is in the service that post offices provide throughout the country and particularly in rural Ireland where they often serve as a hub for social and economic activity above and beyond the delivery of core postal services.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has no statutory function in relation to An Post and has no role or responsibility with regard to service delivery at individual post offices.  Overall, policy responsibility for the postal sector falls within the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as Ms Cronin has already said.  While operational matters and commercial decisions relating to individual post offices are a matter for the management and board of An Post, nonetheless the post office network plays an important role in both urban and rural communities and has been a central part of the fabric of rural towns and villages for generations.<\/p> <p>  The future of the post office network is therefore of great interest to my Department in the context of its rural affairs remit.  The Department is currently preparing an action plan for rural development which will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government for the benefit of rural Ireland.  The plan will contain a number of time-bound actions designed to improve the social and economic fabric of rural communities.  The plan will be published in the coming weeks.  However, the Department has already introduced a number of practical measures to support rural communities, including through the roll out of initiatives such as the town and village renewal scheme, the development of the rural economic zones initiative and the reintroduction of the CL&Aacute;R programme last year.<\/p><p>One of the objectives of the forthcoming action plan for rural development will be to maintain and enhance services in rural communities.  As I have indicated, the post office network provides a very important role in rural communities by serving the needs of personal and business customers and often acting as a locus for other community engagement.  As we have already heard, however, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change with migration towards electronic communications resulting in a decline in mail volumes year on year.  Changes in the way people access services have also led to a decline in footfall in the post office network.  Nonetheless, in accordance with commitments in the programme for a partnership Government, the Department has been working to find solutions to ensure, as far as is possible, the sustainability of the post office network into the future.  The  Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Kerr, was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for additional Government business, as well as commercial business to be transacted through the post office network.  The final report of the group was published in January last year and made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of the post office network.  On foot of this report two working groups were established to progress the recommendations arising from the report of the business development group.  These were the post office network renewal implementation group, chaired by Mr. Kerr and the post office hub working group chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Michael Ring.<\/p><p> The role of the post office hub working group was to identify potential models under which post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  The membership of this working group included An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union and rural representatives, as well as the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The working group has now completed its work and final drafting changes are currently being made to the group's final report, which the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will make available to the Government as soon as possible.  The group has identified a number of potential options under which the post office network could act as a hub for broader activities, depending on different circumstances.  It is fair to say that the most flexible model would see local post offices act as multi-purpose spaces for the community.  This approach has proven successful in other jurisdictions.  The working group has recommended the establishment of a small number of pilots to test the various models as soon as possible and as circumstances dictate.  This is, however, only one part of a wider picture, which other contributors will speak to today.  My Department has also been examining the potential for the post office network to deliver other services such as the renewal of motor tax.  A number of delivery options for this services have been identified and proposals are currently being finalised in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  One of the key recommendations emerging from the report of the post office business development group was that An Post should introduce a basic bank account as one means of increasing customer footfall.  I note that An Post announced its intention to launch a new payment account in the first quarter of this year when its representatives spoke at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 9 November 2016.  This is a significant development and one which I hope will encourage and attract new customers to An Post.<\/p><p> On a somewhat related matter, the programme for a partnership Government envisages that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders will be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand or the German Sparkassen model, which could be delivered through the post office network.  My Department has held an initial meeting with the Department of Finance on this matter and we have agreed to develop a work plan to examine these various models.  Officials will meet again in the coming weeks and we hope to be in a position to conclude this piece of work around the middle of this year.<\/p><p> These are all elements of an effort to support the post office network and to help it adapt to an ever-changing operating environment.  I am sure further elements of the wider picture will be outlined by other speakers today.  In conclusion I thank the committee members for their attention and am happy to answer any questions the committee may have with regard to my Department's role in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend today to discuss important matters relating to the future of the universal postal service.  As members are aware, as well as responsibility for postal regulation, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is also the regulator for the electronic communications sector.  In my presentation I will give an overview from ComReg&rsquo;s perspective of the matters in hand.  We also have made available to the committee some factual background material.<br\/><br\/>Our remit to regulate the postal sector comes directly from legislation, in particular from the EU postal services directive and the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  Under the Act, An Post is designated as the sole universal postal service provider.  The Act sets out a general description of the universal postal service that An Post is required to provide.  This includes delivery to all addressees in Ireland and collection of posted mail five days a week.  Under the Act ComReg's core function is to ensure that all persons in the State can avail of an affordable universal postal service that meets their reasonable needs.  We also have a role to protect the interests of postal service users, <i>inter alia<\/i>, by ensuring complaints and redress procedures work properly.  We are charged with specifying aspects of the scope of universal service and we measure the quality of service achieved by An Post.  ComReg also sets certain price controls with regard to the service.  We do not regulate the price of mail which is outside the scope of universal service.  Less than one third of An Post group revenue is subject to our price cap control.  I understand that price regulation is of particular interest to the committee today, given the proposed amendments to the Act.  ComReg has no role in the postal network and has no prudential function with regard to An Post.<br\/><br\/>The universal postal services are those necessary postal services where there is no effective competition.  The nature of the universal postal service is set by an EU directive and transposed into Irish legislation by the Act.  In many European states, and further afield, we see a serious and marked decline in letter volumes, offset to some degree by growth in packet and parcel traffic arising from e-commerce.  Such packet and parcel traffic tends to be outside the scope of universal postal service and is largely based on commercial negotiations.  In Ireland the universal postal service consists largely of the posting of letters.  As there is no effective competition for these postal services, the EU directive and the Act require that the prices for such monopoly universal postal services are cost-oriented and affordable.<br\/><br\/>As An Post is the sole designated provider of the universal postal service, we remain concerned about the liquidity situation of An Post, which has declined from a cash-in-bank balance of some &euro;350 million in 2008 to less than &euro;40 million.  The liquidity issue facing An Post has been steadily developing over several years.  Since 2013 ComReg has engaged experts to review the financial situation of An Post and has informed its shareholders and stakeholders of these findings through reports and in our publications. The universal postal service has been losing a lot of volume and according to An Post these volume declines are to accelerate significantly while costs have not fallen at the same rate.  To date ComReg has taken measures to allow prices for universal postal services to increase significantly to ensure continued provision of the universal postal service.  For example, the price of a stamped letter has increased by 31% in recent years, from 55 cent in 2013 to 72 cent today.  This has mainly been achieved through the current price cap control, specifically required in legislation and established by ComReg in June 2014.  The price cap in place took forecasts from An Post on volumes and costs, sought certain efficiencies and allowed An Post to make a profit.  As a result, losses on the universal postal services subject to the price cap have reduced significantly, from &euro;57 million at the end of 2012 to &euro;19 million at the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/>When ComReg set the price cap control, it was designed to bring the universal postal services segment of An Post&rsquo;s business back to profitability over five years.  This was, however, dependent on certain assumptions provided to us by An Post and the success of the price cap in bringing the service back to profitability has also been dependent on certain actions to be taken by An Post.<\/p><p>The forecasts and assumptions, provided by An Post as input to the price cap, have not transpired in four significant ways.  First, An Post forecast that there would not be any wage increases to be made within the five-year term of the price cap but, as mentioned earlier, wage increases have been agreed.  It is worth noting that in rough terms, each 1% increase in wages adds &euro;4 million in costs per year.  Second, the decline in mail volumes has exceeded An Post's decline forecast.  Each 1% decline in volume reduces revenue by about &euro;4 million each year.  Third, An Post has not achieved the target of a 2% improvement in efficiency per year.  This modest efficiency target was based on internal benchmarking in An Post that showed potential inefficiency of up to 22%.  However, An Post has failed to meet the 2% annual target in any year, as confirmed to ComReg by An Post in a letter in September 2016.  Finally, An Post has not increased prices by the full amount permitted by the price cap mechanism.  Therefore, ComReg commenced a review of the price cap last September.  <br\/><br\/>According to An Post's media release of December 2016, we understand that following the proposed repeal of the price cap, An Post is planning price increases in 2017 of the order of between 14% and 35%.  ComReg is concerned that price increases of such magnitude could appreciably hasten the ongoing decline in mail letter volumes.  Given that our core function is to ensure the provision of a universal postal service for all, I will make a number of key points.  First, large mailers are price sensitive and will move to electronic substitutes.  Research conducted for ComReg confirms that most mail in the State is comprised of letters.  Most of those letters emanate from 20 large customers of An Post.  They are comprised of the larger consumer-facing businesses and organisations such as utility providers, financial service providers and State agencies.  These customers use bulk mail products, which usually require a minimum volume of 2,000 items.<br\/><br\/>Our research has also confirmed, through customer interviews and observing behaviour, that An Post's biggest customers generally seek the cheapest price and will prioritise cost of delivery over speed.  This means that they generally opt for the cheaper deferred delivery option.  They are content for their mail to be delivered in two to three days rather than one day if slower delivery costs less.  For example, a lot of bulk mail has moved to a bulk mail product that delays the mail for three days rather then two days but at a price that is only 2 cent cheaper.  It is worth noting that half of all post is not next-day delivery. <br\/><br\/>Second, in terms of price, there is limited scope to gain significant additional revenue from SMEs.  The universal postal service consists largely of the posting of letters.  Letters posted by SMEs are mainly stamp or meter payment.  An Post's annual revenue from stamped and metered letters is about &euro;100 million, which is one eighth of its total annual revenue of &euro;800 million.  This means there is limited scope for An Post to gain significant additional revenue from increasing prices for its stamped and meter letter service.  For example, the proposed 35% increase for stamped and metered letters would only provide an extra &euro;17 million or so in revenue at a maximum.  It is likely that this additional revenue will be much smaller when subsequent volume declines are factored in.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In conclusion, ComReg is an independent regulatory body.  Therefore, we recognise the necessity for the Minister and Government to develop the policy framework and for the Oireachtas to consider and pass legislation.  We wish the recently-appointed chief executive officer and chairperson of An Post well in their endeavours.  We recognise the commitment and contribution made by An Post staff.  Our role is to carry out whatever tasks and duties are given to us in legislation.  We will carry out our remit as proposed by the amending Act upon its commencement, including the proposed requirement to produce a report to the Minister in two and a half years after the amendment.  Our overarching function will remain that of seeking to ensure the provision of a universal postal service that meets the reasonable needs of users.  Undoubtedly, the pricing freedom proposed by the amendment will allow An Post to increase the price of certain universal products.  However, significant restraints to price increases exist for the majority of mail as bulk mailers can choose cheaper options, including electronic substitution.  With a view to the medium-term sustainability of the universal postal service, price increases must be combined with the development of new business models, the achievement of cost structure changes and efficiencies and ultimately a fundamental consideration of what type of universal service is required and desired by the State.  I thank the committee for the time to discuss this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his presentation.

Subsequently, I was asked by the board of An Post to chair a working group of invested parties, that included directors of An Post and members of the Irish Postmasters Union, to make implementation recommendations for the future of the post office network in urban and rural Ireland.  I worked from January to December 2015 on the initial report and from January to December 2016 on the supplementary report that I submitted to the company on 24 December or Christmas Eve 2016.<\/p> <p>  The board of the company has yet to consider my report so I shall give a relatively high level summary of its contents to the committee.  There are 1,130 post offices in the network.  It was, and still is, my stated ambition to keep open as many of them as possible to serve the needs of the community, particularly in rural Ireland, where quite often the post office is the last remaining business in a town or village.  The market has changed and the product mix and service that customers require has also changed, which means the network must change to meet consumer requirements.  Two thirds of business is transacted in the top 350 of the 1,130 post offices.  As the cost of keeping open more than 530 offices that are not required to fulfil the social welfare contract is &euro;10 million per annum and rising, radical action is necessary.<\/p> <p>  I can say the following having worked closely with the IPU and the company for two years.  While all parties do not agree unanimously with my recommendations, there is agreement on a large element of them.  Further negotiations are necessary between the company and the IPU of a contractual nature in order that a new contract can be accepted and implemented as soon as possible for anyone who wishes to take up such a contract.<\/p> <p>  In order for the post office network to transition to a new model that is more about the provision of financial services in larger offices and providing limited post office services and more community-based services in rural post offices, I propose that the Government invests &euro;56 million over a four-year period commencing in January of this year.  My overall recommendations include a proposal for three new categories of post office, in a four-year proposition with a different solution for each category of post office, and its commencement date should be now or imminent.  I propose a capital investment plan for the larger offices, as well as a limited exit package for an estimated 80 offices over four years, because some post offices desperately want to leave the network and I do not believe there is real value in keeping them.  I propose a co-location incentive to incentivise the relocation of offices into bigger retail formats, which is where a stand-alone post office would merge with a shop operated by the likes of Centra or SuperValu, a bonus incentive for larger offices and a financial incentive for the top post offices to move to a new contract.  This would mean that post offices of the first and second categories would sign a new contact that is less favourable to them, thus ensuring savings for the company.  I also propose scaled income protection to include full protection for smaller offices and limited protection on a scaled basis as revenue rises in rural offices.  In addition, I have outlined a specific responsibility for An Post and the IPU in terms of receiving Government support.<\/p><p> On the commitment required from the postmasters, they must operate the company&rsquo;s proposed basic bank account, as was referred to earlier, and I propose that all contractors must sign new contracts in grade 1 and 2 post offices.  The option to co-locate is also encouraged.  The commitment by An Post, as proposed, is to endeavour to keep the network open, to advertise all vacancies and to provide financial transparency for the Government and Irish Postmasters Union, accepting the principle that some matters are commercially sensitive and cannot be shared.  The Government must also make a commitment in respect of my recommendations.  It must make motor tax services available at all post offices.  Equally, it must promote - to the Department of Social Protection - post offices as an option in the context of the collection of social welfare payments.  The Government must give An Post the option of distributing additional government services and must underwrite the four-year deal.<\/p><p> With the support of Government during the next four years, the post office network can remain largely intact and transition to a model that is in line with customer requirements.  The new grades of post office will allow for a better commercial proposition in the busier offices and offer protection on a scaled basis to the outlying rural offices.  I welcome any questions that members may have and I thank the committee for listening to my proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby Kerr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kerr.

An Post is a much-loved company and brand.  I had said that my job was to ensure that its future is as bright as its past, meeting the seismic market changes head-on.  When I started - and only when I started - it immediately became clear to me that the scale of decline in the mails business was such that urgent action was required in order to provide certainty regarding cashflow for the next two years.  It was also apparent that while An Post had done a magnificent job improving the quality of its service to become one of the best postal operators in Europe in terms of quality, there was no strategy to sustain its future against the global trends of electronic mail substitution and the move towards a cashless society.  The scale of the problems facing An Post - both in our post office and mails business - is immense.  The next few years - indeed the next year - will be a time of great change for An Post.  It is necessary change to ensure that the company continues to play its central role in Irish life and business.<\/p> <p>  I presented to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment the urgent need for An Post to have a step-change increase in its pricing in order to bring it into line with - not beyond - its European peers.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, responded decisively by proposing the removal of the price cap, which was an anachronism in the age of e-mail and social media.  Legislation to give effect to this is now working its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also tendered for a global consultancy to undertake a comprehensive review of the postal market in Ireland and of An Post in the context of international best practice.  Recently, the selected consultancy, McKinsey and Company, has installed a team at the General Post Office.  Its work will be completed by May.  In the last days of 2016, we took delivery of the final report of the post office network strategy group, which is Mr. Kerr's report.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of pricing.  The decision to increase pricing in the mails business was not a difficult one in the context of the global trends in post.  The inexorable substitution of e-mail for physical letters is a well-established trend.  Although Ireland had been slower to adopt e-mail, that trend is now catching on here.  Mail volumes in Europe have declined by 41% on average in the past decade and in Ireland by 38%.  We expect that by 2020 mail volumes in Ireland will have declined by at least 50% since 2007.  An Post incurred losses of approximately &euro;15 million in 2016.  With current volumes, without price increases, losses of at least &euro;40 million would be forecast for this year.  To balance the loss of volume, letter prices in Europe increased by 36% from 2007 to 2015 and with further increases of up to 10% in 2016.  In Ireland, over the same period, prices have increased by only 16%.  The average stamp price across the EU15 is currently &euro;1.06 and increasing.  A price increase in line with peers will allow An Post to continue to meet its universal service obligation, delivering mail to every house in the State each weekday for a uniform price, with one of the highest next-day delivery rates in Europe.  We expect to increase our prices as soon as the legislation is approved and signed.  This will be a one-off increase in the range of 12% to 38% across our range of products and is urgently required for An Post&rsquo;s sustainability without any recourse to State or taxpayer funding.  It is the only means to provide financial certainty while An Post restructures its business following the strategic review to ensure its long-term viability.<\/p> <p>  Another issue of vital importance to the committee is the future of the post office network.  This area of the business is also subject to inexorable global trends.  The move to cashless transactions, electronic transfer and e-mail substitution is reducing the need for a physical post office network, not just in Ireland but across the world.  In the past three years, the number of social welfare customers has declined by 17% and bill-payment transactions have fallen by over 20%.  The latter reflects an increased number of electronic transfers.  Simply put, fewer people need to visit post offices.  Some of the decline has been mitigated by a range of new services.  Our foreign exchange cash-and-card has become a significant income stream and has captured 30% of the foreign exchange market.  Bank services that An Post operates for AIB, Ulster Bank and Danske Bank have captured some of the transactions from closed bank branches.  State savings continue to grow impressively - now standing at over &euro;20 billion, or 17% of savings in the State - through the post office network.  Overall, however, the post office network will incur losses of over &euro;10 million in 2016 and these losses will accelerate.<\/p> <p>   I am well aware that An Post has more than a financial imperative.  The post office network is not just about making money, it is also - critically - about meeting a social need.  I and my colleagues are committed to the dual task of commercial viability and public service.  I have met several times with officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  I have also had meetings with Mr. Bobby Kerr and the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union.  I received the final recommendations of the post office network strategy board in the closing days of 2016.  That report has not yet been seen by the board of An Post.  I have only just received it and it would be unfair to enter into too much detail on the report at this stage.  My initial reaction is that while I agree with the broad thrust of the report in the context of the future viability of the post office network, it does not - and cannot reasonably be expected to - go far enough to be considered a plan capable of implementation.  Nor does it provide a funding solution that maintains the integrity of An Post as an independent semi-State.  These are issues that can be resolved, and I hope will be resolved, but they will take a matter of months to do so.  My job, and the job of my team, is to complete the rigorous and detailed plan and professional work that will see a strengthened post office network that is commercially viable and meets social need.  We need to review the current configuration or real estate at a unit level, local level and national level.  We need to identify the future product set such as what will be sold through post offices and scour the globe for best practice elsewhere.  We also need to properly size the overhead requirements.  I am doing this work with McKinsey and Company and it will involve all stakeholders.   This work will be completed by May.  The Bobby Kerr report is an important and valuable input and I look forward to discussing it further with the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.<\/p> <p>  I wish to impress upon the committee the urgent and vital need for the price increases that will ensure the short-to-medium term future of An Post and bring it into line with its European peers.  There is no alternative to these price increases if we wish to keep An Post as an independent semi-State and to ensure its future.  These price increases must be made and An Post must be brought in line with its European peers.  I must emphasise the importance of carrying out a rigorous and professional strategic review in order to provide the design for the long-term viability of An Post.<\/p><p>The price increases will provide cashflow for two years.  I intend to work with the chairman, the board and all the stakeholders in An Post to redesign the company within those two years so that it has a long-term future.  There is much else going on at An Post while I lead these initiatives.  When I arrived, my assessment was that too much was going on.  Since then, we have reduced our efforts from 120 ongoing projects to concentrate on six major projects of which pricing, the strategic review and the post office network are just three.  The intention of this work is to ensure An Post&rsquo;s commercial viability and, more importantly, its ability to meet and exceed its public service obligations.  I look forward to sharing our progress with this committee in the year ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McRedmond.

I will begin by recording our concern about the likely impact of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016 on older people.  It is widely recognised that older people are more likely to use the postal service.  According to media reports before Christmas, the price of a national stamp could increase to between 90 cent and &euro;1.  I can tell the committee with absolute certainty that an increase of such magnitude - 25% at the lower end - will be noticed by someone whose sole income is the State pension.  Older people will make a conscious decision to send fewer letters, with a corresponding knock-on effect on postal volumes.<\/p> <p>  I assume a potential increase of this nature would not be considered without detailed research to assess its likely impact on existing mail volumes.  It would be helpful for this discussion if such research were published.  If research has not been carried out, it should be commissioned because it would be a mistake to proceed with the removal of the price cap in its absence.  I recommend that the committee should consider amending section 2 of the Bill to ensure a review of the consequences of any repeal of the price cap starts no later than a year after the commencement of the legislation.  Under the Bill as it is currently drafted, ComReg would not deliver a review to the Minister until two and a half years after the repeal of the price cap, with a further delay before the review would be made public and possibly another delay before any necessary corrective measures could be implemented.  If it transpires that the removal of the price cap is a mistake, the sooner we can identify any problem and correct it, the better.<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment briefly on the report prepared by the Post Office Business Development Group.  I welcome the recognition in the report that the post office is an essential service for facilitating communication and interaction in local communities.  It is especially important for older people who use the post office to collect pensions, access cash, pay their utility bills, save money, buy stamps and, most importantly, meet their friends.  One member of Age Action Ireland has described the local post office as the most sociable place in town.  For many people, pension day continues to be the highlight of the week.  Other members with whom we spoke in advance of this meeting told us that the post office is the only place for them to meet people to catch up and that post office closures help to isolate the elderly.<\/p> <p>  The closure of post offices in rural communities forces older people to rely on the rural transport system - as Deputies and Senators are aware, it is absolutely not fit for purpose - or on the kindness of friends and family members to get to the next town.  As a result of the closure of the post office in the west Galway village of Cleggan in September 2015, the 260 residents of Cleggan must now travel 3 km to Claddaghduff for postal services.  A local resident has explained that pensioners and others with disabilities are struggling to pick up their benefits.  While the issue of post office closures is often seen as a rural one, urban communities are also affected.  A supporter of Age Action Ireland told us in advance of today's meeting that since the closure of the post office in Sandymount, some older people are hiring taxis to get to other post offices to conduct their business.  Post offices are undoubtedly of greater importance in more rural communities but we should not lose sight of the centrality of this service in larger towns and cities as well.<\/p> <p>  The report touches frequently on the increasing use of online communications, which has been raised by many of those who have already spoken at today's meeting.  With the rise of e-mail, there is a corresponding decline in postal volumes.  We are certainly becoming more digitally focused as a society.  I emphasise the importance of appreciating that not everyone is moving at the same pace.  In September 2015, a EUROSTAT report found that just 37% of Irish people between the ages of 65 and 74 use the Internet.  This compares unfavourably with Britain, where the figure is 70%.  Across the EU as a whole, the average rate of Internet use among this age group is 42%.  These figures take no account of people aged 75 and over.  The most recent figure for such people comes from the 2013 national digital strategy, which found that Internet use among those aged 75 and over is negligible at approximately 3%.  I stress that this figure is not low because older people are incapable of learning.  Age Action Ireland's Getting Started programme, which is funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has provided free one-to-one training in computers to almost 30,000 older people over the past ten years.  We know that older people are as capable of mastering new technologies as anyone else but we also see nervousness among many of our members about learning something new and frustration among those who are unable to use what they have learned after they leave our classes because they live in broadband blackspots.  Despite the rise in the use of e-mail, a robust and sustainable post office service and network remains essential for such people so that they can communicate with their friends and family and carry out their daily business.<\/p> <p>  We strongly support the recommendations in the report regarding the expansion of banking and financial services.  We look forward to the introduction of the new payment account highlighted by An Post today and in its presentation to the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The report notes that banks are moving away from providing financial services in rural communities.  I am not sure that members of the committee fully appreciate the frustration of many older people with their current banking providers.  In 2014, research carried out by the County Wicklow network for older people found that many older people are very critical of the service provided in banks.  They are frustrated by restrictions on counter services, by overt pressure from bank staff to use automated services and by the continued efforts of banks to move services online.  It is a recurring complaint that our staff hear from older people across the country who prefer to carry out their financial business face to face, dealing with people they know, trust and on whom they rely.  I believe there is an enormous opportunity here for An Post.  I suspect that many older people will be eager to avail of it.  I thank the members of the committee for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.

I have the happy task of representing 8,500 postal workers who are the public face of the post office.  It has been made clear in every survey that has been conducted over the years that postal workers are seen as the most trusted workers in the country.  This is particularly the case in provincial Ireland, where many people do not have contact with anybody else.  Like many workers throughout the country, the staff of the post office endured a pay freeze for eight years.  The collapse in mail volumes during that time enabled us to reduce the number of full-time equivalent staff by almost 1,800 without any recourse to industrial action.  That was not something I was happy to see, but we had to deal with it.  We also dealt with the pension crash and helped to rescue the An Post pension fund.<\/p> <p>  Half of the recent pay increase, which was mentioned earlier in this meeting, was paid for by the cuts made by staff.  It is interesting to note that the Labour Court said that the shareholder, the management and the staff of An Post had responsibility for pay movement in the company.  It is noteworthy that this was included in the Labour Court recommendation.  The quality of the service provided by An Post has improved from 64% next-day delivery during the administration prior to the most recent administration to 94% next-day delivery at present.  There is no doubt that this is one of the best services not just in Europe but in the world.  The post office has not received any State subvention since it became a semi-State body in 1984 even though it was promised &euro;55 million under legislation that was introduced at that time.  This money was never paid.<\/p> <p>  It is a considerable worry to all of our members that despite the ongoing cost reductions, the pay freeze and all the efforts we have made, the company remains in a precarious financial position.  The pricing strategy that has been followed in the industry over the last 12 to 15 years has played a large part in the maintenance of this precarious financial position.  If modest price increases had been sanctioned over that period, perhaps to bring average prices in line with other European countries, we would not be having this debate here today and the company's financial position would not be of concern.  I listened with interest to the ComReg view of the world, but the reality is that within its remit it is supposed to take account of pay movement and other issues under the postal services legislation.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to track the collapse in mail volumes.  It started with the economic collapse.  At that time, mail volumes reflected economic activity.  The approach taken at that time hastened the move towards electronic substitution.  Other things are going on each day.  Every banking utility in the country incentivises people to stop using mail.  The reality is that elderly people and people in technological blackspots are subsidising those who are able to pay lower prices to service providers.  Many companies reduce the bills of those who do not use the services of the post office while maintaining higher bills for those who have no option but to use them.<\/p><p>The decision to allow these utilities and banks to force customers to opt-in rather than opt-out has hastened the demise of the postal business.<\/p><p> On employment, a delivery office in a town is the equivalent of a small factory.  It helps to create economic activity.  That should never be misunderstood.  An Post is probably the single biggest employer in the State, with the biggest fleet and reach and paying the State significant amounts in employee and consumption taxes.<\/p><p> The social aspect is one of the main features that seems to be missing in society today.  What kind of society do we want?  It impacts on the postal network and post offices.  Post offices have a contract with the Department of Social Protection, under which they must encourage social welfare recipients to go online.  They would lose elements of the contract if they did not push the online piece.  The contract will do away with post offices.<\/p><p> Like most people, we are impressed by the Bobby Kerr report and believe something drastic needs to be done.  Every town should have a centre where people can congregate and do their business electronically work if they cannot do so nearer home so as not to denude rural societies.  I do not share completely the view that it is also a city issue.  With the availability of public transport, one has some hope of gaining access in a city, but we do not have that option around the country.  It is largely about the kind of society we want to have.  Obviously, it is aksik about providing employment within that role.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its consideration.  In dealing with the terrible difficulties to do with finance and property one might consider we have citizens and workers who are also of interest to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick.

I heard what Mr. Bobby Kerr said about his recommendations which I welcome.  Even though we do not agree with all of them, we are prepared to work with An Post immediately to translate them into an immediate action plan.  This must be done.  On a personal level, I thank Mr. Kerr for his work with us in the past two years, during which he successfully overcame a serious illness.<br\/><br\/>We view the post office network as a national asset.  It is a key resource in dealing with many of the challenges facing communities, both urban and rural, throughout Ireland.  We can offer expanded State and financial services, as well as innovative social and community services.  The network can become the State on one's doorstep by providing improved access to Government services locally and good value for the people in so doing.  An Post is one of the most trusted brands in Ireland and this trust and goodwill have been represented to us.  We were able to collect 500,000 signatures in a two-week period and hand them in to the former Minister, Mr. Alex White, 18 months ago.  In an online poll conducted recently on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>, subscribers of which would not be traditional post office customers, 82% of those who replied within three hours stated they wanted more services to be made available through post offices.  The post office network needs the recommendations made by Mr. Kerr to be translated into an action plan immediately.  Otherwise it will collapse.  The network is owned by the people of Ireland and part of the fundamental economic and social fabric of the country.  It is a national asset.<br\/><br\/>The current changes happening in the country are affecting and damaging communities which believe their views are being ignored and have been by successive Governments.  In particular, rural communities need support to help to stop the negative multiplier effect as different services are withdrawn.  For instance, when the Garda station or a bank is closed, there are few jobs available and higher unemployment.  Everybody has said people have to travel further to access services and there is a negative knock-on effect in reduced footfall.  Local pubs and shops close; young people become more disillusioned; more people leave and the decline continues.  Post offices serve as a magnet in retaining footfall in towns and villages and, in some cases, attract an increased footfall.  When post office services are withdrawn, there is less incentive to visit or stay in a town or village and other businesses suffer.  The State, as the owner of the post office network, has a major role to play in redressing the issues faced by communities which experience significant barriers in accessing State services.  The network currently provides sensitive and secure services and is well positioned to address gaps in the provision of State services and be developed into a network of community hubs which would see communities participate in dealing with health issues, providing financial services, engaging in social enterprises and providing information on Government, tourism and transport services.<br\/><br\/>Postmasters are paid by transaction.  They are independent contractors, but they cannot select the services they offer.  They depend on the Government and An Post in that regard.  They cannot decide them themselves.  Additional State, financial, social and community services post offices could provide include all Government payments for the Department of Social Protection, as well as motor tax, Health Service Executive, Central Applications Office, third level and licence fee payments, as well as fines.  We could supply all Government forms, including identity verification forms.  Research we have carried out suggests postmasters could fulfil the role played by peace commissioners.  We could operate a standard An Post bank account.  We can and do carry out contact transactions for all commercial banks, including Ulster Bank, AIB and Danske Bank.  Technology would allow us to provide for remote health checks and have prescription drop-off points.  We could provide information on transport and bookings.  We could also provide for transport pooling by providing a meeting point.  We could provide IT and IT training services.  We could guarantee broadband provision.  Post offices could be a citizens' and tourists' information centre, but these services would require Government investment, both current and capital.  The level of investment required, as I have stated, would provide good value for the people of Ireland, but action is needed now.<br\/><br\/>All of the issues have been debated at length by the post office business development group set up by the former Minister, Alex White.  As he stated, Mr. Kerr was appointed in December 2014 and we have worked with him for the past two years.  The two working groups are almost finished their work.  Mr. Kerr presented his report to An Post on 23 December 2016 and we received a copy of it yesterday.  The post office hub working group which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, held its initial meeting last July and its findings are being finalised.  All of the issues affecting the post office network have been identified and considered.  The time to finalise a comprehensive five-year plan to transition the network is now.  The post office network is at breaking point because of the reduction in transaction levels and the collapse of the network is imminent.  Individual postmasters remain under pressure to maintain their post offices.  As such, we need the action plan now.  The recommendations have been made.  They need to be translated into an implementable action plan, not today or tomorrow but yesterday.<br\/><br\/>We are ideally placed to make a significant contribution in meeting the challenges faced in both urban and rural Ireland.  As I said, we can provide good value in doing so.  We ask the committee to request the Ministers, Deputies Denis Naughten and Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, to act immediately to ensure an action plan immediately will be finalised immediately with us and An Post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned O'Hara"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Hara.

I have a short Powerpoint presentation.  What I have to say is contained in the report, copies of which are available if anybody wants one.  Apparently, it is also available online.  I will be as brief as possible.<\/p> <p>  I am the owner of the company which is an SME.  I would be seen around the world as an addressing and postal expert.  For 14 years I have been a member of the consultative committee of the Universal Postal Union, the United Nations affiliated organisation which regulates the terms and conditions postal operators around the world use with each other in dealing with cross-border mail.<\/p> <p>  Postage cost is an important issue for Tico Mail Works, a bulk mail provider.  We produce 15 million pieces of mail every year.   We provide An Post with one of every 50 pieces of mail it delivers and an income stream of &euro;7 million.<\/p><p>Corporate social responsibility is extremely important to us.  The sustainability of our customers and our suppliers is extremely important.  An Post helps us achieve those objectives.  The quality of service it provides is world class and its staff, network and initiatives at community level provide this country with a huge amount of the social inclusion we are looking for as a society.  We want An Post, as I believe does everybody else here, to be sustainable also.  That is the first reason we are here.<\/p><p> The second urgent reason we are here is that we are looking at legislation which will remove our domestic price cap.  According to the press releases we saw at Christmas, the domestic tariff of 72 cent could increase the price of a stamp to as much as &euro;1.06.  In terms of the reasons given for that, we have heard falling mail volumes and that tariffs are not comparative with An Post's peers.  I will agree that letter mail volumes around the world are falling on a regular basis, and they have been doing so for ten years, but the e-commerce side of An Post's business, as the regulator has told us, is bringing huge numbers of packets and parcels into the business.  In fact, in terms of the income stream from those volumes, what post offices around the world are losing in letter mail they are gaining in this packet and parcels area.<\/p><p> With regard to the tariffs being lower than those of our peers, I suggest that we look at our nearest neighbour, which provides us with possibly as much as 90% of our inbound international mail.  Its headline tariff today is 64p.  At today's rates, that works out at about 73 cent where the rate here is 72 cent but the United Kingdom has a second class tariff of 55p, which is in the 64 cent rate, so I would say that our tariffs are comparable to those of our biggest trading partner.<\/p><p> The last published An Post accounts we have seen are the 2015 accounts.  If we look at its business, members will see that mail domestically in Ireland, which turns over about &euro;360 million in those accounts, lost just &euro;1.6 million, so it is effectively a sustainable business within the four corners of this island.  The problem, if we look at those accounts, is that the international inbound and outbound mail is causing An Post to lose in the order of &euro;20 million, and there is another element on that chart, which is in this report, which is that the registered mail is not being charged at a high enough rate.  As members will see in the corner of that chart, I am saying that the average amount of money being paid by foreign postal operators for An Post to deliver its mail here in Ireland is 44 cent, whereas if the members or I were to go down to the post office and mail a similar item with a stamp on the front that somebody has written on the outside, that would cost us 72 cent.<\/p><p> The solution to the problem of this &euro;24 million loss in those 2015 accounts is the three points I have outlined.  First, increase the tariffs for registered mail, which would make that service sustainable.  Second, increase the tariffs for the outbound mail to make that service sustainable.  Those areas are outside the price cap area and An Post can do that themselves.  The third area is to negotiate new bilateral agreements with the largest deliverers of mail into this country, the largest being Royal Mail.<\/p><p> There is one other reason we would increase the charges foreign postal operators are paying for mail into this country, and it goes back to this EU directive which states: \"Whenever universal service providers [that is, An Post] apply special tariffs, for example for services for businesses, bulk mailers or consolidators of mail [consolidators being Royal Mail and Tico Mail Works] from different users, they shall apply the principles of transparency and non-discrimination with regard both to the tariffs and to the associated conditions.\"  This directive states that An Post should be charging Royal Mail not 44 cent for those pieces of mail but somewhere closer to the 72 cent rate or at least 43% more than it is charging currently to make that service sustainable for An Post.<\/p><p> I was before this same committee in 2003 and, more or less, I made the same statement.  In 2003, An Post was losing &euro;20 million on international inbound and outbound mail.  A quick examination of the accounts shows that nothing seems to have changed in the 14-year period.  An Post is still losing the guts of &euro;20 million on that international traffic.  I am sure people in An Post have tried hard to renegotiate those agreements and, as a small postal operator, I will guess that it has been difficult so perhaps we should be looking at these international agreements to see if we can work with their terms and conditions to provide ourselves with sustainable cross-border, by which I mean international, mail traffic.<\/p><p> There are two multilateral agreements which An Post has signed up to.  One is called Reims, which is effectively with European post offices.  The other is the Universal Postal Union terminal dues agreement, which is more or less with the rest of the world.  Under these agreements, An Post gets 80% of its headline tariff for each piece of mail so it should be getting 57.6 cent, based on the 72 cent rate, for every piece of mail that comes into the country from European postal operators, and 39.6 cent from the rest of the world.<\/p><p> If we increase the headline tariff by, say, 43% to &euro;1.03, An Post will have a sustainable service, we will be getting 84.8 cent from the Europeans and the rest of the world will be paying 58.3 cent, but what would be the effect of that increase?  As we heard earlier, increasing the headline tariff will have a detrimental effect on postal mail volumes in Ireland.  Around the world there is no price elasticity with regard to consumer mail, which represents about 10% of the market.  That is common knowledge, outside this country anyway, so even if we increased the price to &euro;2, and I apologise to Age Action, there will be very little change in this market.  That is consumer mail and by that I mean consumer to consumer or consumer to business.<\/p><p> However, business mail is a completely different picture.  Business mail is highly price elastic, as we have heard already.  Every time An Post increased its rates over the past 30 years, I got telephone calls from my customers saying they have a budget for postage this year and asking what they can do about it, and the only real solution has been to reduce volumes.  If we are to increase the headline tariff to what has been suggested, namely, &euro;1.03, then in this business mail area there should be no tariff increases or as few as possible.  There should definitely not be tariff increases for bulk mail products.<\/p><p> The solution is the same as before.  We need to increase the tariffs for registered mail and increase the tariffs for international outbound mail.  If we cannot renegotiate those multilateral agreements, we should not increase the prices for business mail and especially the bulk mail.  I thank the members for listening to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Pigot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pigot and all the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.

Do I take it from his report that he is recommending the closure of 80 post offices over the four-year proposed plan?  Is that the limited exit strategy he referred to and, if so, has he identified any particular ones or how did he arrive at that figure?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kerr might expand on what the &euro;56 million Government investment figure would be spent on.

Does he see that as something that should be resolved at a lower level within An Post?<\/p><p>Mr. McRedmond of An Post indicated in his submission that the Kerr report does not go far enough to be an implementable plan and it does not provide the funding solutions maintaining the integrity of An Post.  What do you mean precisely by that?  Will he give an honest opinion on what needs to happen in order for An Post to be on a sound and secure footing?  Will Mr. Pigot speak more about the effects of increasing the headline tariff for households who only post a few items per year?  Is there international evidence on that?<\/p><p> With regard to the Department, coming back to Mr. Pigot's point this evening, the vast majority of losses in the mail service come from registered post and international mail.  If those two items were addressed, the loss in domestic mail could be more easily managed.  Was that part of the consideration when considering removing the cap?  With regard to the Irish Postmasters Union, the Kerr report recommends three different categories but is the union in favour of them?  They are retail, service and community.  Will the witnesses expand on the consequences of those post offices categories for the Irish Postmasters Union?  The report identifies a lack of consensus with regard to the role of postmasters.

There is much to take in and it is unfortunate that we probably do not have more time to address the matter.  I will not go back over what has already been addressed.  It is clear there is a recognition by all sides of the perilous state that the company finds itself in and an acceptance in general that some drastic action must take place.  I am not overstating or understating the issue.  There is some change in emphasis in how this might be addressed.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, the first matter we must address is whether we support the proposed legislation.  It seems from my party's perspective that there is a necessity to do something immediately to address the financial hole emerging in the An Post balance sheet.  This seems to be the most obvious way to do that.  I am taken very considerably by Mr. Pigot's comments and I ask Mr. McRedmond in the context of his internal review and the work of McKinsey if there has been consultation with Mr. Pigot and those like him in his company in addressing proposals.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien made an important point towards the end of his presentation, which contained much good stuff, in saying that ultimately there should be a fundamental consideration of what type of universal service is required and desired by the State.  That will pose a significant question to An Post and McKinsey in terms of the proposal it has brought forward, as well as Mr. Kerr.  It asks if consideration had been given in Mr. Kerr's report to looking at the current universal service obligation of next-day delivery.  Ms Cronin indicated the Government's position is very strong in retaining that.  If we bring all that together, the question to Mr. McRedmond is whether he believes it is sustainable.  Does he believe it is possible to have An Post operating in a financially viable manner, taking into consideration all the pressures that have been identified?  Will it be possible to maintain that into the future?<\/p> <p>  Following from the Chairman's comments on the Kerr report and the difficulty in taking it as an implementable plan, is it Mr. McRedmond's belief, based on the terms of reference that have been provided to McKinsey, that he will get back a deliverable or output from that process that will be an action plan or where an action plan will have to be developed from the conclusions of the report?  I ask this not to be overly prurient about how the company does its business but with regard to timing.  It is clear from the comments of Mr. O'Hara and others that there is an immediacy about addressing this.  There was mention of the end of quarter two for the production of that report but will that be the definitive report and action plan at appendix two, five or whatever?  Will it be just a document forming the basis for an action plan that the management team will have to put forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#M00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>With regard to the exit package I have proposed, first I suggest that a limited exit package is made available for a period.  There are some post offices that are no longer viable within the network.  Mr. O'Hara and Mr. McCann would concur with that.  The other point is that we must be realistic and say it is not realistic for every post office to survive.  Some of the revenue from an outlying closed post office - where there is a wish to close and exit the system - will transfer to other offices.  I stress that I call this a conditional exit package and it is only available to category 3, which is the smaller post offices.  It is only available where the specific post office is not required to fulfil the social welfare contract.  I have made a proposal around it that is similar to other exit packages in the past.  I estimated the cost of &euro;50,000 per closed office, providing that up to 80 would be allowed to close over four years, costing in the region of &euro;4 million.  Those figures have been provided to me by the company.  If that is clear I will move to the next answer.<\/p> <p>  There is a breakdown of the &euro;56 million I am proposing that the Government would invest in the business to sustain it.  I am talking about a capital expenditure programme of &euro;9 million.  Without getting too detailed, I propose that the capital expenditure would be largely spent in bigger offices.  There would be approximately &euro;50,000 in the top 50 offices, approximately &euro;18,000 in the next 300 offices and small money of less than &euro;2,000 in the remaining offices.  I also propose a co-location grant of &euro;1 million, which is again for the smaller categories, 2 and 3, to move from a standalone post office.  If approved by the company, these would merge with a Centra or Spar, for example.  I am proposing &euro;8 million for contract sign-on.  Taking the contract that is currently in existence, the current postmaster contract has existed for longer than the State and it has not been changed.  I am proposing that categories 1 and 2 would move to a new contract that would be less favourable commercially, with &euro;8 million to incentivise the move.  Currently categories 1 and 2 are on a three-year rolling contract and there must be an incentive to ask them to take less favourable conditions.<\/p> <p>  There is also the guarantee of providing every postmaster with the minimum wage.  Currently, the guaranteed minimum paid to a post office is &euro;11,000 per annum.<\/p><p>I propose we increase that to &euro;20,000.  The minimum wage is &euro;19,000, so just slightly above the minimum wage would be guaranteed to every postmaster.  If I may, I will take a drink of water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby Kerr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":217,"content":"<p>If Mr. Kerr gets that over the line, he will be sent a whiskey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#N00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The guaranteed income, which is the scaled payment I propose for categories from &euro;20,000, which is above the minimum wage, up to &euro;100,000, would cost &euro;18 million over the four years.  This is an element of my proposal that is not acceptable to the company, but I propose that &euro;12 million be paid to the company to ask it to keep the network open, advertise all vacancies and basically support offices that are not commercially viable.  I mentioned earlier the exit package, which is &euro;4 million.  This comes to a total of &euro;17.75 million for the first year, &euro;11.75 million for the second year, &euro;13.75 million for the third year and &euro;12.75 million for the fourth year, giving a total of &euro;56 million.<\/p> <p>  I only mentioned the water tax specifically because I have mentioned in the initial report a whole raft of services that I believe should be provided.  The reason we drill down into motor tax in this recommendation is that it is probably the most significant service in terms of adding value to the post office.  It is the one service that will bring the most commercial value and the best commercial return to the postmasters.  That is the reason for the focus on it and singling it out.<\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy Dooley's question about the universal service obligation, I did not consider it.

The reality is that there are 1,100 post offices, most of which are individual businesses.  We have a real responsibility to do this job properly.  Given the nature of how the industry and electronic substitution are developing, I do not think we will have a second chance at this.  It must be done very seriously and very properly.  It must be costed fully through.  There is nothing in Mr. Kerr's report that has not been done properly but, quite simply, it will take the full team at An Post to work through all the detail.  I also want to include the international best practice we can get from McKinsey.  I very much hear what Mr. O'Hara from the IPU had to say.  I hugely sympathise with the postmasters and postmistresses and the predicament they are in, but this only makes it all the more important that I and my team do the job properly.  Considering what the services can be not just four years but ten years from now, we have one go at this and we need to do it properly.  What I am saying relates to Deputy Dooley's question as to whether we will come up with an action plan as a result of the strategy work.  The answer is \"Yes\".  It is not actually a strategic plan, it will be a set of decisions, and these decisions will come forward to the An Post board.  We will involve all stakeholders, including Government, employees and our customers.  Everybody will be involved in this.  I fully intend to bring forward some major decisions, both for the mails business and the post office network business.  I do not expect, for example, with the post office network business, to stray far from some of the recommendations in the Bobby Kerr report.<\/p> <p>  The issue I was asked about regarding the integrity of An Post is probably a policy issue.  It is one on which we are in discussion with the Department.  I have also had discussions with Bobby Kerr about this.  It simply concerns the flow of funds.  It is extremely important that we do not have a semi-State company become a State company by receiving a subsidy from the State.  It is very important that funds do not go into An Post from Government because that could become an open chequebook.  Rather, the relationship that Government has is more properly with the postmasters, since the whole issue is whether the postmasters can provide a whole range of services outside of An Post.  Our job in An Post will be to keep the network open, keep investing in the network and work with the network.  The issue really comes down to the level of what might be considered a subsidy, the minimum payment, that is made to post offices that do not reach that threshold through their commercial activity.  This is where the discussions are, but these discussions can be held reasonably quickly.  The Department with responsibility for rural affairs has already asked us to have such discussions.  I am happy to discuss that with the IPU and everybody else.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked about Mr. Pigot's views, which are very interesting.  I enjoyed his presentation greatly.  He put more emphasis on price increases and services with which he is not involved than services with which he is involved, but I would certainly consider the international issues he raised.  I think he also knows that An Post has very little influence in many of those agreements.  I would probably come more from Mr. Pigot's view that there is more we can do about it and challenge.  There are certainly elements in what he has said that we will take into account.  That is very much where we can rely on working with McKinsey, which works with every post around the world, to get its views and the views of other posts.  I will be in the UK next week and will meet several chief executives from different posts.  That work absolutely will happen and will be accelerated.<\/p> <p>  The final question was whether the USO is sustainable, which Deputy Dooley asked.  It is very clear in my mind that what we are doing with this price increase is giving An Post a two-year cashflow to be able to restructure and reshape the company.  It is not a panacea for the long term.  We must get our work done within those two years.  For the period during which we are doing it, we certainly intend to maintain the universal service obligation, USO.  It would be invidious to say we will put up prices and reduce the service, but there is a major strategic issue about what our customers want.  What are the services customers need most?  There are interesting examples.  I was very impressed by Age Action's presentation.  However, if one considers the example of pensions, of new pensioners coming into the system, fewer than 10% go to a post office to get their pensions.  They get them through electronic transfer.  These are the sorts of realities we must deal with.  This is not to forget the 10% who probably need to come to the post office, and we need to deal with that, but these are all the issues we need to consider properly.  I cannot answer the question about the USO.  It is absolutely the right question because the other side of this equation is the costs of An Post, and I am absolutely clear that we need to consider our costs.  An Post will be a smaller organisation, but in the immediate term we need to have the cashflow for the next two years to address these questions properly.  Come May, we will have an action plan that I would like to then share with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Pigot to respond to the questions asked of him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#N00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked a question about the price elasticity for consumer mail.

The Minister is conscious that the universal service obligation is an obligation on the State, which it has assigned to An Post and, leaving that aside, it is a very important obligation.

Those were the parameters.

The contributions that have been made have been very informative and useful.  Unfortunately the common theme running through them is a confirmation of what we know, which is that An Post is in deep financial trouble.  It is in a perilous position and, effectively, in its present format it is running into the sand.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Pigot made the comment that he was here in 2002.  With all the people we have around the table this evening, particularly including the Department officials, why does An Post have to go to the edge?  Why does it have to be on the brink of collapse before some constructive and positive action is taken?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Kerr's report has been generally received favourably because it makes a genuine attempt to address the many issues that need to be addressed.  I ask Mr. McRedmond whether Bobby Kerr's report will become the basis and subject of analysis and discussion through the McKinsey report.  In other words, there must be a starting point.  Many advancements have been made in terms of the co-operation Mr. Kerr's committee received.  We need to expand on that and see what elements of it are workable and achievable.  <\/p> <p>  We all want to preserve An Post, we want to retain the network and we want a universal service.  The Minister would be pleased to hear that the Government do not necessarily have to pay for a universal service but somebody has to pay for it.  The Government most definitely has a responsibility in funding some element of the universal service.  If it is not going to be funded by way of a subvention, the postmasters around the country would expect that financial support will be provided if they are to maintain the service, which is part of the basic fabric of rural communities.  The Government has a role, an obligation and a responsibility to play its part in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The reality is that An Post, as we know it, is a failed entity.  It is floundering.  In its existing format it does not have a future.  If one was to consider it in any context, one would say it is currently on life support and in need of financial resuscitation.  I have no difficulty with the increase of between 12% and 38% across An Post's product range.  Obviously that must be done because An Post is in crisis but I ask Mr. McRedmond what assessment has been done of the impact such a price increase would have on the volume of mail traffic?  How confident is he that this increase will be an interim measure that will be successful?  With such increases, there can be the habit of saying in two years' time that we have not had sufficient time or we may need another increase for another further two years before we can make the hard decisions that are necessary.  <\/p> <p>  Everybody involved understands the difficulties with an Post.  We have had it analysed and assessed, we have had evaluations, reports and recommendations but there is very little time left for reflection.  I am glad that at least the McKinsey report has a timeline of May because the time for reflection is limited.  It is time for action and decisive policy initiatives.  It is imperative that An Post is redesigned and restructured to take account of the current environment both at home and internationally.  Mr. Pigot made the comment that we view this from the perspective of our consumer base.  That is what attracts everybody's attention with respect to how it has an impact on our people, communities and society.  The points Mr. Pigot made about the possibility of increasing tariffs for international outbound mail and the renegotiation of the bilateral agreement are important.  In other words, the burden would be shared across all of the group's operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#O00300","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I ask Senator Lombard to put his questions to the witnesses and then I will ask the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#O00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting contributions on this serious issue.  I note the Bobby Kerr report was commenced 24 months ago.  We have had two phases of that report and will have to wait another six months for an update on where An Post is going.  It will be 30 months since this review was commenced.  It is a perfect storm, in that the demand for the service is declining yet the population is increasing.  People have moved to the use of electronic services and away from the use of the old traditional services.  This poses the question as to how we will deal with that.  The national spatial strategy indicates that 1 million more people will be living in Ireland in the next 20 years.  We have had an additional increase in population of 1 million over the past 20 years.  The population has increased yet the demand for this service has continued to decrease.  The concern is on how we can move the service forward over the course of the next 20 years, if it survives.<\/p> <p>  There are two lines of thought on this.  We are considering reform of the service and increases to the pricing.  I might be wrong on that but I believe that is the general thought on how we will move An Post forward.  The proposed reform of An Post includes providing a banking structure or working with a bank and perhaps incorporating a shop and offering a motor tax service.  Those are the reforms proposed in the Bobby Kerr report.  When we take into account what the regulator, Mr. Kevin O'Brien, stated regarding the proposed reform of a 2% saving that failed to be delivered by An Post, what confidence can we have that An Post can deliver these reforms?  That is a concern.  If the 2% saving proposed previously was not delivered, how can we have confidence that these lines of proposed reforms can be delivered?  That is the dilemma we face.  We must have confidence that these reforms can be delivered.  Previously a proposed reform was not delivered but we are saying these proposed reforms can be delivered.  I hope that can happen.  The reforms Bobby Kerr has proposed are positive.  It has taken 24 months for them to be put forward but they are good.  If we look at the history, do we have confidence that they can be delivered?  <\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of the pricing structure.  The cost of a stamp to post mail locally is 72 cent.  The cost of sending a postcard to New Zealand is &euro;1.10.  I can send a card to my friend from Cavan seated beside me for 72 cent but it would cost me &euro;1.10 to send a postcard to my first cousin in New Zealand.  There is a major issue regarding our pricing structure and how we are going to address that.  That is the other side of the equation.  The question is: how are we going to deal with those issues?  The international post side needs to examined more than anything else as it is a key issue in delivering a pricing structure that can benefit the network.<\/p><p>Can these reforms be delivered, taking into consideration the history and the regulator saying that they were not previously delivered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#O00500","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to respond, first of all to Deputy Lowry's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#P00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The view Deputy Lowry paints of An Post is not inaccurate.  The Deputy might be going a little bit too far but it is not inaccurate to say that it is a very challenged entity.  The whole purpose of doing the strategy work is to carry out a very fundamental redesign of the business.  In particular, we must recognise the need for the different elements in the business.  The post office network is a very different element from the mails business and from the packets business.  Each of these areas need to be very tightly defined and operated in order that there is clear accountability for those businesses.  My own observation is that it is quite difficult to manage as a very large single entity with a single centre.  We will certainly be looking at that very carefully.<\/p> <p>  The Bobby Kerr report is at the basis of what we are doing with McKinsey when it comes to looking at the post office network.  It is a very important input.  I cannot say for certain that it is the absolute basis.  We are in agreement on the financial envelope being in the area of &euro;56 million to &euro;58 million.  The deficit currently incurred in the network is somewhere in the region of &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million a year.  To that degree, I believe we are very much on the same page.  I like many of the ideas in the Bobby Kerr report.  The real issue is in bringing it down to a detailed local level.<\/p> <p>  The economic need can be defined.  There are profits and losses for each post office.  However, I believe we have to define social need.  One of the things that is often said is that it serves a social purpose.  We need to define what that is, whether it is the distance from a post office, being within 15 km of a post office, maintaining a community of 100 people or 500 people, and so on.  That is the kind of detailed work we will do.  Most importantly, we will provide solutions.  We have to come up with solutions for postmasters and postmistresses whose businesses are struggling.  We must make sure that they are solutions that can actually work.  If there are some cases, as Bobby Kerr has identified, in which there is not a solution, then we need to work out how these people can work financially to be able to leave their businesses.  That is the level of detail that we must work to.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the impact and the volume and whether we have done the work.  We have done considerable work on elasticities, which everybody is talking about, which essentially asks how much it will actually be for every percentage price increase.  There is no doubt that price increases will accelerate volume reductions, particularly with regard to bulk mail.  That is why we have to be very careful how we structure the increases and where we bring them in.  We have done that work at a very detailed level.  We are not proposing these price increases to reduce our revenue.  We are proposing them to increase the revenue to provide An Post with certainty for the next couple of years.  That work has been done in a lot of detail and has been shared with the Department.  I believe it is a robust piece of work.  We did it with Mr. Alan Gray of Indecon.  It has since been checked by PwC and NewERA.  Therefore, several groups have looked at it.<\/p> <p>  While talking about the areas of An Post that are very challenging and difficult, there are also areas that are really valuable and growing rapidly.  That is the difficult piece in designing An Post for the future.  The first is the parcels and packets business.  These are the shovels for the goldrush of e-commerce.  We grew our sales in the packets and parcels business by 24% in December.  That is a business that will grow rapidly.  It just so happens that over the next couple of years, it is insufficient to close the gap on the reduction in mails.  That is a very important and substantial business and is the future of posts around the world.  We have direct mail, which is advertising mail.  In Ireland, we send a quarter of the direct mail that is sent in the US and half of what is sent in the UK.  It is a business in which An Post is already substantially established.  It is worth about &euro;60 million in revenue and that could be doubled in a relatively short period to become a very big media company in the sale of direct mail.  We are launching a current account in the financial services sector within the next few months.  The current account will be followed up with other financial services.  We have been very successful with Post Insurance.  It is a fabulously-run company based in Athlone.  There are several examples of good growth in An Post.  The issue for me is simply trying to get it into a structure that is more coherent for the future and for the long term.<\/p> <p>  My final point on the future of An Post is that postal services throughout the world are not doing badly.  Postal services in Europe are doing well.  They have often taken very different models.  In Denmark, there is a model which has almost eliminated mail.  In Italy, there is a model in which the post office network is hugely driven by financial services and is the largest provider of credit card services, etc.  There are different posts in different countries that are working and that have found a way through the issues of declining mail.<\/p> <p>  I am not here asking for two years to be able to do things.  I fully believe the work we do will be designing a company that has a very strong future.  It may a different size and it will be a different configuration, but that is what we will do.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard asked whether we are confident that the reforms can be delivered.  He raised the issue of ComReg reporting the 2% of savings not delivered.  I need to understand that issue a bit better.  Mr. Fitzpatrick mentioned the reduction of 2,000 employees in An Post over the past eight years.  We are continuing everyday to redesign our network and to make incremental reductions to tailor the network to meet the falling mail volumes.  We also need to invest staff in our parcels and packets business, for example.  With all of that, there will be huge challenges.  There will be huge challenges for the employees, the unions, our customers and for everybody in terms of whatever changes we make.  However, we will work our way through it.  I am confident in what I have seen so far that there is a will to work our way through these issues and find a way to find an An Post of the future.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is very important for employees to have a sense of what that future is.  It is not good enough just to say that we are going to remove X number of jobs.  We have to show them what the future is, what the future of the post office network is, what the future of the mails business is, what the future of the parcels business is, what the future of financial services is and design the plans to do that.  I believe it is incumbent upon us to do so as we look to restructure and reform within An Post.  I believe it is quite reasonable for the employees to demand that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the pay increases that happened, which representatives of ComReg mentioned, I have no issue with people who have been under a pay freeze for nearly ten years to be able to have what was a modest increase of 2.5% last July, with the Labour Court making that recommendation over the three years.  I accept that.  We have to work on that, but we also have to deliver the savings.  I believe it is well-recognised by the unions and employees that those savings need to made and agreed targets need to be reached, and we will get to them.  Those are the sorts of issues we are facing.  It is not going to be easy for anybody.

However, at the end of the day, we are probably in a position in which our members will decide whether we accept it or not.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the three different categories of post office.<\/p><p>Our position is that all post offices should offer all services.  We recognise that there is a difference between busy urban post offices in Dublin, Limerick or Galway and rural post offices.  I also agree with Mr. McRedmond about the challenges that face us in both businesses - mail and retail.  In respect of the retail business, where postmasters operate, we have gone through a process for the past two years of inviting submissions from the public.  We spoke to everybody, produced a report and designed a solution.  We do not agree with all aspects of the solution.  There is lack of consensus on some issues in the report.<\/p><p> There are serious issues for us in respect of the contract and we need to get into the detail.  The devil is in the detail but we need to do that now.  I recognise the need for a strategic review of the company on the McKinsey report but our fear is that if we get involved in that we will be sitting here next January and nothing will have been implemented.  The process relating to the report started in January 2014.  It is now 2017.  We have to do this now.  We have to get into the detail and produce a plan.  An Post needs to do some of the things that are in the report quickly.  Like Senator Lombard, we recognise the threat from electronic substitution.  We cannot plan.  I do not know whether there will be a post office in ten or 15 years' time but I do know there will be one five years from now.  We should plan for that and in three years&rsquo; time, we should plan for the following five years because the world is moving forward apace.  We have invested two years in producing solutions - I was going to say we have wasted two years.  We do not disagree with the big picture but we need to work out the detail now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned O'Hara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":236,"content":"<p>What measures would the Irish Postmasters Union put in place to achieve consensus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#Q00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484672700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>We and An Post have to spend two weeks in a room with someone banging our heads together until we come out with this detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned O'Hara"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>This has been an extremely worthwhile meeting, with very interesting and worthwhile presentations.<\/p> <p>  This is a very sensitive and important issue for all of us.  The people we represent are watching our performance, with reason.  They value the postal service and the network of post offices highly.  I do understand there has to be change but they value what exists and the universal services obligation.  For them it is an extremely important service.  That is why we are all sitting around late tonight and there is an earnestness about the meeting.  This is not something casual or trivial.  We, as politicians, are reluctant to approve price increases.  We tend to do the popular thing if we can but it is interesting that across the political spectrum there is an acceptance that An Post needs the increase.  I share that view but I also pay tribute to colleagues who are not of the Government party and who share that view.  Not to engage in populism on an issue like this takes some political courage.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Parnell, Mr. Kerr and several others said they want to widen the services, get a greater range of financial services in, and make the post office more usable and attractive with more happening than traditionally and there are different types of post office to attract extra business and make them more relevant.  I applaud that.  While I know that Mr. Kerr is keeping that to a minimum but we at this end of the table do not want post offices to close.  We want them to be open and successful.  I am somewhat persuaded by the view of Deputy Lowry that there will be a need for a level of State subvention.  We do not want unfettered, unchecked, uncontrolled and wasted State support but there will have to be a level of support and I would be in favour of that in order to preserve the universal social obligation and keep as many outlets open as possible.<\/p> <p>  All of us, including the Government, have mitigated against post offices by actively encouraging electronic social welfare payments.  When I was a child, the collection of pensions and other social welfare payments at post offices involved a social dimension and that has been undone.  It was a societal and cultural shift which I suppose had to happen.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean this in any patronising or silly way but I am very encouraged by Mr. McRedmond's vision and commitment.  He has a great handle on this.  I was going to ask about parcel post, which has not caught up yet.  Intuitively, I think he is correct that parcels should become a big business because Internet sales are growing exponentially.  I notice my children buying stuff via the Internet in a way that I would never have done.  That is important and so are financial services and the current account dimension may help.  The direct leaflet drop is also important for industry.  It is good to hear Mr. McRedmond identify three positives that we could build on, as well as seeing the need for reform and change and that is healthy.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Pigot's contribution about the review of the international agreements was very interesting.  It would be great if something was done about that.  We should not be losing in that area if we can avoid it because we do not want a diminution of service or outlets.<\/p> <p>  I am impressed by the speed of action.  We need to move fast when the McKinsey report comes out and it is good there is a date for that.  The questions have been asked but this is so important that I make no apology for speaking.  I wanted to put it on the line that the people I, as a Senator, represent in Cavan and Monaghan dearly value their post office network, want no reduction except where it is impossible to avoid and want a good universal service.  I am encouraged that a real effort will be made to achieve that.  If that needs a level of subvention then so be it as long as it is sensible and used properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#Q00400","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":239,"content":"<p>It is very clear that the network and the corporate entity of An Post have been drifting into a fairly serious crisis over a long period.  Some of those here may not have been in positions of responsibility during much of that time.  Since this committee was formed at the start of last summer and the appearance here of the new chairman it has been clear that the company had major problems.  I do not profess to be an expert in corporate entities but I am chairperson of a small company and that type of drift would not go on from one month to the next without people being called in and action being taken.<\/p><p>The corrective action that is needed would be monitored every month.  The first thing that An Post, as a big semi-State company, needs to do is to get out of this position.  It needs to start getting on top of things.  The Minister and the Department need to keep a close eye on things in this committee and this House to ensure this is happening.<\/p><p> I would like to speak about the network in the first instance.  I read the Kerr report very carefully.  It was one of the first things I did after the formation of the Government.  I felt it was important as an Opposition spokesperson to do so.  I think there are many good ideas in the report.  There are many things in the Kerr report that Sinn F&eacute;in would have suggested and agreed with over the years.<\/p><p> I would like to ask Mr. Kerr a question about the smaller post offices.  The social importance of the network is a reality, just as the commercial reality is.  In small villages and towns, services are provided in small clusters by shops, post offices, pubs and Garda stations.  If one of those facilities is withdrawn, the hub is reduced and the cluster loses some of its effectiveness.  Has the issue of shorter opening hours been considered?  Perhaps post offices could open in the mornings only.  Maybe they do not have to open every day of the week.  Have such options been examined?<\/p><p> Regarding the investment of &euro;56 million, I am concerned that the larger and more commercially viable post offices are getting the largest slice of the cake.  I am not sure that is what is needed.  It has been mentioned that banking services will be provided at larger post offices.  Is it proposed that full banking services will be available at smaller post offices?  Would the single payment account be available at every post office?  I think that would be important.<\/p><p> Mr. McRedmond of An Post management said that the plan does not go far enough.  I agree with his point that in light of the scale of the drift, we will have one chance to do this.  I think there has been a scandalous drift.  It is regrettable that we have allowed it to get to this point, but we are here now.  Tomorrow is the first day of the future.  We cannot go backwards.  In what way does the plan not go far enough, according to Mr. McRedmond?  I would like him to articulate or spell out his views in this regard.<\/p><p> Mr. Kerr and the IPU have suggested that the recommendations need to be implemented quickly.  What kind of timescale do they have in mind?  The IPU suggested that new services could be provided at post offices.  Mr. O'Hara referred to the role played by peace commissioners.  I remind him that the position of peace commissioner is a voluntary one.  Is the IPU suggesting that people should charge for signing forms?  I know that those who carry out this role at present, one of whom is my wife, are happy to do so on a voluntary basis.  I have had to go to peace commissioners over the years.  I have never been asked to pay anything in return for their services.  My own view is that the current position should not change.  There is a good tradition of civic duty in Ireland.  People like to provide things voluntarily.  Is the IPU suggesting that its members should receive a payment if they were to take on this service?<\/p><p> I would like to pick up on the point made by Mr. Pigot of Tico Mail Works about the amount of wriggle room or elasticity it enjoys when it is charging for mail.  I am not convinced about that.  He probably has a point.  I think we need to take on board Age Action Ireland's point that many elderly people who live alone depend solely on the State pension and have to pay all their household bills from their low incomes.  I think a price increase would lead to a reduction in the use of the post office by those who depend on it most.  I am sure the statistics we heard from Age Action Ireland have been researched.  Mr. Moran told us that just 3% of those over the age of 75 use the Internet and e-mail.  This means such people depend heavily on the services of An Post.  I would question the point made by Mr. Pigot.  He might flesh it out a little bit more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#Q00500","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to try to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#R00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I am nearly there.

If it merely sets a cap, how is that cap reached?<\/p> <p>  I would like An Post management to address what will happen if the price of a postage stamp is increased by up to 38% in the absence of a marketing strategy and the full implementation of the Kerr report.  I do not think these issues can be separated.  Unfortunately, two different Departments are responsible for the network and for An Post.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is responsible for An Post and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is responsible for the network.  I do not think they can be separated.  The recommendations of the Kerr report and the business development group need to be implemented quickly.  I suggest the imposition of a significant increase in the price of postage in the absence of the implementation of those recommendations would be counterproductive because it would turn people away from postal services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#R00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McLoughlin for his patience.

I believe this debate is of the utmost importance to the constituency I have been elected to represent.  People in many rural towns and villages are living in fear and worry because the local post office has been lost or is under threat.  People who are worried are watching and listening to us.<\/p> <p>  It is particularly important for Mr. McRedmond to comment on the position going forward in light of recent experiences.  I would like to ask him about the ongoing difficulties caused by the closure of post offices in rural locations throughout Ireland and specifically about the status of two post offices in my constituency.  There has been uncertainty about the future of Ballygawley post office in County Sligo for quite a while.  I cannot understand why a decision has not been made.<\/p><p>Mr. McRedmond might be aware that in November 2016 I was advised by the management of An Post in Sligo that following the death some weeks before of the local postmaster, Mr. Colm McTiernan of Ballygawley post office, whom I knew, that an operational review of the post office needed to be undertaken by An Post.  I argued against this, given the popularity of the post office and the ability of his wife to continue the business and service at Ballygawley.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Angus Lafferty, a public affairs manager with An Post subsequently confirmed to <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the contract for Ballygawley post office was now under review.  He said that a consultative period would continue until 2 December 2016.  He finished by stating that a decision on whether to keep the post office open was expected some weeks later.  As I am the local public representative, I alerted the community and the local media to the fact that it was important for the community to let An Post know how important their post office was to them during the time allocated for public submissions.  I was pleased that hundreds of people have signed petitions and sent letters calling for this post office to be saved.  I would like an indication from Mr. McRedmond as to when a decision can be expected on this issue from An Post.  I have been in constant contact with Mr. Peter Gillespie, who is a fine ambassador and excellent employee of An Post at regional level about the urgent need for this post office to be retained in the local community and for a decision to be made on Ballygawley post office as well as the post office in Blacklion, County Cavan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#R00700","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>May I ask Deputy McLoughlin to conclude?

There would be specific negotiations on a case-by-case basis with the company but I think An Post would be prepared to look at the solution of part-time service in particular locations.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the Deputy's second question on expenditure, which he believed was misdirected and directed towards larger rather than smaller post offices, I think that could be the case relative to capital expenditure only.  If one looks at the spread of the &euro;56 million, almost as much is going to the 700-odd post offices as to the other 300 but it costs more to refurbish the larger shops and that requires greater capital expenditure.

We are not looking for a payment <i>per se<\/i>for this role but people suggest they must travel 15 to 20 miles to a local Garda station to get their identity verified but the garda does not know who they are.

I genuinely think the issues in An Post are a result of global trends.  There are issues on whether we should have known this earlier.  Indeed the Department has written to us to identify better processes to ensure we could do that.  I am quite clear that people in An Post are committed to ensuring the future viability and good management of the company.  I think that sometimes forces can be very strong and we have discovered, particularly in the third quarter of 2016, that the acceleration in decline in mail was very notable.  That happened to coincide with the time I took up the position and we could see the picture more clearly then.  While it was a trend, the trend accelerated quite dramatically in that third quarter.  On the question of whether financial services will be available in all post offices, yes, I hope so.  On the question of whether the account will be available in all post offices, yes I hope so.<\/p> <p>  In response to questions on the Kerr plan and the ways in which it does not go far enough, I think I have covered most of these areas.  It is really describing a four-year window and I think we need to see beyond that.  There are some commercial elements and a contract needs to be negotiated with the postmasters and postmistresses.  I think there is room.  However, we have to bring this down to a really detailed level such as, for instance, the questions Deputy McLoughlin has asked of me.  I will not be able to answer them now but I will be in contact with him this week on Ballygawley and Blacklion.<\/p> <p>  The consultative periods are very important.  We get different levels of response.  Sometimes one gets no response or a limited response and sometimes one gets a response that is negative or a response that is positive.  The outcomes of the consultations are taken seriously and we look at them because they give us an indication as to whether there is an activity there in the future.  It often can be an indication that we cannot find somebody willing to take up the contract and that can be indicative that there simply is not sufficient activity there.  We have to understand what the community wants and how much the community will engage with it.  Sometimes those answers are not always obvious and they can be surprising.  I will revert to Deputy McLoughlin on the post offices.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley stated that the increase in the price of the postage could be counterproductive.  There will always be an element of that when there is a price increase.  We have done as much due diligence as one reasonably can in terms of working out the elasticity.  One difficulty with bulk mail is that some of our very biggest customers are switching to e-substitution quite rapidly.  To be honest, whether the price they are paying is 57 cent, 67 cent or 80 cent, if they can see the opportunity to make a level of saving, which is not between 57 cent and whatever the higher price might be but actually is to save the whole amount through e-substitution, they will do that.  One of the real difficulties when one looks at decline in mail is in questioning how much of the decline is due to price and how great the decline would be in any event.  We forecast, even if we did not increase the price, there would be a very substantial decline.  Indeed we are forecasting a 10% decline in mail even without an increase in price.<\/p> <p>  We have done the work to the best of our ability to say that the proposal will deliver a yield, the question is how much that yield will be and whether it gives us room to implement the changes we need to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017011700002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1484672700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

If one calculates the losses on the USO over that period, it runs in hundreds of millions.  That was the money the company could have used to invest in new products and new services and could have used it to invest to make the transition from letters to parcels and packages and could have used the money to try to encourage people to leave as the business collapsed.  All that money has been wasted in plugging the gap for many years.  The USO is the cost of delivering to every household in the country five days a week.  When one loses 1,000 letters on a delivery, the postman is probably going into a house with two letters instead of three.  It is very difficult to make those savings.  The way to deal with it was to reflect the movement in price across the EU, not to have Ireland with the cheapest postage stamp rates in Europe.  The demographic spread on our small island means that Ireland should have the dearest postage rates in Europe.

Deputy Stanley asked if we could describe how we implement the price gap.  The price gap was required under legislation and has been in place since 2014.  It is built basically from information provided by An Post.  It is something of a mathematical equation.  With the An Post volume decline estimate, we sought the 2% per annum efficiency which I mentioned.  We had An Post's costs estimates and we put these basically into the model.  We also allowed for profitability on universal service, so there is a margin to be gained.  Based on the information we had in 2014, we put a model in place.  As I said in my presentation, it was based on information from An Post, and An Post indicated at the time that it was happy with that.  I would indicate that it was a ceiling on price, so An Post was free to increase prices to whatever level it wanted within an overall basket.  There was a sub-control of the stamped and metered price to protect SMEs because under the Act we were required to protect SMEs.  That was the model in place required by legislation, which we put in place.<\/p> <p>  It significantly reduced the losses in USO in relation to revenue covered by the price cap.

As members will be aware, at the 16th EU-Canada summit in Brussels, on 30 October 2016, EU leaders and the Canadian Prime Minister signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement.  The landmark deal which runs to some 2,500 pages represents a comprehensive transatlantic trade agreement which seeks to eliminate or reduce trade barriers in virtually all sectors of EU-Canada trade.  Our most recent experience of applying a comprehensive trade agreement with one of the third countries, South Korea, has seen a 25% increase in trade.  If this trade intensification were to be replicated in the case of Canada on foot of full application of the CETA, Ireland could expect exports to rise by &euro;500 million per annum.  The total value of Irish exports to Canada is &euro;2.3 billion per year, with the total value of imports being &euro;729 million.  We expect these levels to increase as the CETA covers not only the traditional tariffs and quotas which apply to goods but will also free up trade in services. <\/p> <p>  Ireland is the fourth largest recipient of Canadian foreign direct investment.  The stock of Canadian direct investment in Ireland amounted to approximately &euro;11 billion at the end of 2015.  With Canadian companies already investing actively in Ireland and employing some 2,800 people, an increased focus on bilateral trade and targeting inward investment from Canada can lead only to further growth. <\/p> <p>  Almost half of the benefits anticipated under the CETA are expected to be in the services sector.  There is a significant opportunity for Ireland, given its strengths in services.  It has been particularly successful in expanding its share of the world&rsquo;s services market in recent years; in fact, our share has tripled in the past 15 years.  Services exports account for more than half of all Irish exports.  In the case of goods exports, the CETA will save on duty costs, as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force of the agreement.  Firms exporting from Ireland will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on \"double testing\" on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is of particular benefit to smaller firms which can ill afford to pay twice for the same certification test. <\/p> <p>  The CETA provides for a significant opening up of agrifood trade.  Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the European Union, thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  We were also successful in securing the multi-annual phasing in of the additional quota granted.  On the other hand, in terms of our offensive interests, we have secured full unrestricted access for Irish beef and other meat products to the Canadian market. <\/p> <p>  In recent years Ireland has developed an important pigmeat export trade to Canada and there is now potential to develop the export business for Irish beef and lamb products also.  The removal of the Canadian import tariff of 26.5% will benefit Irish meat exporters.  The CETA also provides significant new opportunities for the Irish dairy sector.  In addition, there are a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies arising from greater access to the Canadian market, including in financial software, telecoms, digital media, agricultural machinery, the life sciences and medical devices.<\/p> <p>  On public procurement, for the first time, Canadian provinces, territories and municipalities will open their procurement markets to third countries.  Canada will also create a single electronic procurement website that will combine information on all tenders which will correspond to existing intra-EU arrangements.  This will greatly facilitate the effective access of firms to procurement opportunities in Canada.  Making the trading landscape easier is particularly important for SMEs enabling them to internationalise and grow exports.  Trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms which have fewer resources relative to larger firms to overcome them. <\/p> <p>  As well as providing new market opportunities for Irish firms, the CETA has the potential to provide consumers, businesses and individuals with a greater choice of quality products at lower prices. <\/p> <p>  As Members will be aware, the Council's decision of October 2016 provides for the provisional application of the CETA, such application being a standard approach in trade agreements.  Procedurally at this point, provisional application requires a favourable vote in the European Parliament plenary session in February - this is likely to occur on 17 February - following a recommendation from the International Trade Committee of the Parliament, INTA, on 24 January.  However, members may be aware that certain provisions of the CETA will not be applied provisionally.  Most noteworthy among them are those relating to investment protection and investment dispute settlement.  The European Union and Canada have also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument that was added to tje CETA to provide further assurances on public services, labour rights, water services, sustainable development, environmental protection and investment. <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will also be aware that the opinion of the European Court of Justice has already been sought on the EU-Singapore free trade agreement to determine the limits of the European Union&rsquo;s competence in the matter of trade and foreign direct investment.  The opinion of the Advocate General was published on 21 December 2016.  It indicated that the EU-Singapore free trade agreement could only be concluded by the European Union and the member states acting jointly, in other words, it was a mixed agreement.  The opinion contains the Advocate General's view of the law and recommends to the court how it should decide the case.  The court has yet to make a decision, but it is due to do so in early 2017.  Ireland argued at the court that the Singapore agreement was mixed.  That has also been our position on the CETA.  Accordingly, in order for the CETA to be fully ratified by the European Union, it will have to be approved by all 28 member states in line with their national legal procedures.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the agreement will be brought before the D&aacute;il for ratification in due course. <\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies in focusing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.  Enterprise Ireland stands ready to support Irish companies in seeking to take early advantage of the opportunities presented by the CETA and will be supporting additional trade events in Canada in the coming year to help Irish businesses to enter the market or expand their presence, including in particular, through a trade mission later this year to be led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor.<\/p> <p>  The agreement is very important to Ireland.  The CETA and the European Union&rsquo;s other trade agreements will help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide opportunities for Irish firms.  The importance of applying and exploiting existing agreements and accelerating negotiations on new trade deals at EU level and in the WTO is underscored by Brexit.  Trade diversification has been a consistent national policy objective.  While progress has undoubtedly been made, the need to further reduce our dependence on a limited number of markets and, in particular, the United Kingdom, will be a key element in mitigating the negative impacts of Brexit.  Continued access to the European Union&rsquo;s network of trade agreements is just as important and a significant competitive advantage for Irish exporters and iinvestors seeking to establish in Europe.  From experience, we know that an open global trading environment works for Ireland.  The combination of export-led growth and foreign direct investment has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the longer term and more recently played a key role in national economic recovery.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth. <\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will happy to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his statement.

We had a similar position in the Canadian deal.  With respect to opening up services markets, concessions are made to allow people to come to Ireland or the EU or to go to Canada to try to promote their services or deliver a services contract.  If a person got a contract to deliver ICT services or something, he or she would get temporary permission to enter Canada to deliver that service.  We maintain that control of our national border outside of the Schengen Agreement is a matter for the member state in Ireland's case, and therefore that falls to the national competence.

It said that CETA must be decent in terms of \"job creation, balanced wage increases and expanding enterprise possibilities.

As members will be aware, that line of production has different economies of scale and costs than producing with hormones or GMOs.  There is no lessening of the food quality or safety standards in the beef that would be admitted to the European market, and that tends towards levelling the costs or any cost disadvantage caused by the size of the Canadian industry and Europe.  The corollary is that Irish farmers will have unrestricted access to sell premium beef products into the Canadian market, whereas the Canadians are subjected to a quota in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Tariff free?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Tariff free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>In the agreement there is no specific chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and that is a concern I would have.

They are an arbitration mechanism under this agreement which can be opted for.  A Canadian firm owning a firm in Ireland can sue the Government in the morning.  If the Government causes harm to a Canadian firm here, it can go to the Four Courts and sue it.  The investment protections apply a common set of rules in 28 member states that would be applied by a single panel of people as an arbitration mechanism and as an alternative to using the domestic courts.

The UK Government, along with the Governments of the other 27 member states, approved the provisional application of CETA at Council level.  I would guess that it is anxious to see the provisional application in place.  As the Deputy is aware, the UK Government has spoken about transitional arrangements.  It is probably anxious to avail of all the benefits of all the trade agreements, including on a transitional basis, pending the conclusion of its own agreements with third countries.  The UK Government is already a party to the provisional application.  The national ratification process, for which there is no time limit and which normally takes three or four years, is the reason the application is provisional.  If the agreement is approved by the European Parliament in a plenary vote in February, we will move almost immediately to provisional application, immediate entry into force and the imposition of a 0% rate of tariffs on 99% of industrial goods.  The clock will begin to run in the agriculture area, where there will be special phasings over a long number of years.  For the next two years, at least, the UK will have the full benefit of provisional application, obviously minus the investment protection or the investment court system, which will not come into effect until the agreement has been ratified by all 36 or 38 member states.  It is difficult to know whether the absence of the UK from the final ratification of the agreement would be material.  Countries on the other side, such as Canada, might regret the concessions they made when they reached agreement on the basis of being able to access a market of 500 million people when the market is no longer of that size.  Our instinct is that the UK will be delighted to benefit from the provisional application for as long as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Smith, I ask those with mobile phones to turn them off or to enable flight mode on them.

He has painted the agreement in glowing terms by speaking about the possibilities for this country and putting a very positive spin on it.  He has alleged that it could make Ireland even more profitable and competitive and could lead to the creation of many more jobs and opportunities here.  I assume he is aware, as those of us who are informed about the agreement are, that a report published by the employment committee of the European Parliament plays down the opportunities that will come out of CETA, especially by comparison with what we have heard in Mr. Kelly's report.  I would like him to comment on the report.  I assume he is familiar with it.  I will quote some of the aspects of it that jump out at me.  I refer particularly to the predictions in the report about what CETA will bring to the EU.  I ask Mr. Kelly for his comments on the matter.  The European Parliament committee has looked at this in detail, as I assume the departmental officials have done.  According to the committee's report, \"at best [there will be] marginal overall increases for EU employment of no more than 0.018% over a 6 to 10 year implementation period\".  The report refers to a \"forecast [of] actual job losses of 204,000 for the EU as a whole\".  The figures for profits are slightly better, with the report envisaging \"a 0.66% increase in favor of capital owners\".  As an opponent of CETA and as a member of a trade union, Unite, and a political party that opposes the agreement, I ask Mr. Kelly to address that.<\/p> <p>  I am one of the many people who have lobbied, campaigned and protested against the nature of this type of agreement, as other speakers have already mentioned.  We contend that CETA places at risk the safeguarding of workers' rights, environmental rights and local labour law and strengthens the protections for international capital, employers and companies.  I suggest Mr. Kelly admitted that when he said the courts, through the system of investor-state dispute mechanisms, will protect Canadian people who want to invest in Ireland.  He intimated that at present, someone who is hurting because of our laws can go to the Four Courts and take a case against the Irish Government.  I would like him to spell out to me what he means by \"hurt\".  Under CETA, we could be sued in the international courts system not because we have hurt people or impinged on their profits, but because they have lost out on a reasonable expectation of profit.  They might not have lost a single penny, a single job or a single boat or airplane, but they might have lost out on a reasonable expectation of making more money.  On that basis, we are allowing questions to be raised with regard to our labour and environmental protection laws.<\/p> <p>  A Bill proposing to prohibit fracking in Ireland has been tabled by a Fine Gael Deputy and Government supporter and is to be considered on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il shortly.  Lone Pine Resources sued the Canadian Government to the tune of $260 million because it did not want to see fracking banned in the province of Quebec.  Would it not be a great irony if a company from Canada were to take Ireland to court for not allowing fracking in Leitrim?  This D&aacute;il democratically decided to express its opposition to fracking by supporting a Bill that was proposed by a Fine Gael Deputy just before Christmas.  I mention that in the context of Senator Gavan's contention that there is a contradiction in all of this with regard to how we deal with democracies.  This proposal undermines local and international democracy.  This Parliament has decided that it does not want fracking because it is concerned about the poisoning of our groundwater and about climate change.  We do not think we need to extract any more fossil fuels from the earth.<\/p> <p>  We have listened to the many local opponents of fracking and decided that we do not want it.  I am concerned that a company, or an individual who feels he is being hurt because he could have had a reasonable expectation of profit in County Leitrim, will be able to take us to one of these courts and sue us for millions of euro.  Companies have previously sued states on the basis of a loss of reasonable expectation.  This has happened to some of the poorest countries, including Ecuador, and to some of the richest countries, including Canada and the US.  Under this system, decisions on such cases will not be made by a friendly court that represents citizens, but by a court that is structured to represent the interests of business.  The interests of people and the environment are being undermined for the interests of profit.  I know that is a mouthful, but I would like Mr. Kelly to address it so that we can get a holistic view of what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy like Mr. Kelly to respond to the questions she has already asked before she asks any more questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I do not mind.

I am not familiar with the economic modelling used by the employment committee of the European Parliament.  I am familiar with the economic modelling that the European Commission uses.  It is the same modelling that we rely on domestically here - the computable general equilibrium model.  It considers trade and the composition of trade between all member states.  It applies changed scenarios and tariffs, changes to technical barriers to trade to existing trading relationships and tries to model what would happen.  Under that sort of modelling our anticipation is that CETA would support additional job creation and higher value-added or higher-paid jobs in the economy.<\/p><p> We are the subject of constant churn between agriculture, manufacturing and new areas of the services economy.  That transfer of employment between sectors is well established.  We know that trade agreements only generally provide a small increment to that transfer.  We expect that a new trade deal would see certain sectors of the economy attract more capital, be more profitable and create more jobs.  If we had a closed labour market, one might see employment fall in other areas of the economy as employment was created in higher value-added sectors of the economy.  We do not have a closed economy in the European Union and therefore, we anticipate that we will see increased job creation in higher value and more sustainable jobs in the economy in the long-term.  That is our national estimation of what CETA would do for us.  It would create more sustainable jobs in exporting firms in the economy.  We know that exporting firms ride out recessions better and avail of product and service innovation better and that on average, firms pay better in the exporting part of the economy.  We just have to differ in terms of the views of the employment committee of the European Parliament and rely on the sort of the analysis we do, and that the European Commission has done and which, in the case of the European Commission, is in the public domain.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked me questions on expectations of profits.  To clarify, the reason that companies or somebody would feel hurt is established under CETA's terms.  It states that one has to be discriminated against or to have been the object of unfair inequitable treatment.  CETA defines all of that in terms of denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, as well as a fundamental breach of due process in judicial proceedings or a lack of transparency.  Other grounds are if the treatment one has received has been manifestly arbitrary, if one has been the object of targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds such as gender, race or religious belief or if, as an investor, one has been the object of abusive treatment, duress or harassment.  These are the grounds and that is the sort of negativity whereby somebody might complain that their intellectual property rights or other rights have been infringed or expropriated by a state.<\/p><p> On the issue of profit expectation, the agreement explicitly states that a reduction of somebody's expectation of profits is not a breach of the investment protections of the agreement.  If, however, one were the subject of a harmful act by a government, how would we value one's business or investment?  There are standard accounting treatments by which businesses are valued in terms of their assets.  One can value their property, vans or machinery or one might value their contracts or distribution channels.  Anybody valuing a business does so on the basis of it being a going concern as otherwise, one is just buying a set of assets.  Under any accounting treatment when one values a business or a business that has been damaged, it is considered to be a going concern.  As part of that one considers the return on the capital employed.  One would consider future profits and whether its income stream had been damaged by the harm complained about.  There is nothing exceptional about looking at an investment whether it is a stock on a stock market or buying a business.  One values the business based on its income stream.  The expectation is not of somebody who might invest in Ireland and the profits he or she might have made but of somebody who has an investment, can prove he or she was discriminated against and damaged and who can point to a reduction in the value of his or her investment or business using a standard accounting technique that would value a business as a going concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I refer to a scenario in which a company like Lone Pine Resources already was based in Ireland and had an interest in extracting gas, for example in the Corrib field but wanted to extract shale gas in Leitrim.

A reservation is an exception in the general competition rules such that a member state does not have to open its market in these areas.  There are specific exceptions included in the treaty and there is also a set of annexes.  The first annexe is about existing reservations the European Union has.  It is a general set of reservations and covers business, health, transport, cultural, education, air transport and energy services, to mention a few.  It is important to read Ireland's reservations together with the broad EU reservations.  Ireland has five specific reservations.  There are specific reservations in the areas of agriculture, mining and quarrying, legal services, veterinary services and ship registration.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about their method of compilation.  The trade agreements have been negotiated over many years and the previous one to which we referred, a comprehensive trade agreement, is the trade agreement with South Korea.  The reservations we included in the South Korea agreement carried forward into the current set of negotiations.  The European Commission lifts the reservations and we then enter into a consultation process with it.  For that process we consult all Departments and have a set of interdepartmental committees at which we discuss each reservation.  Each Department will tell us if there are particular interests or concerns in its sectors, for example, the health, veterinary and pharmaceuticals sectors.

Ireland is an open economy and Mr. Kelly has hit on a number of points.  I am curious about where he believes the greatest pitfalls for Ireland are in this deal since he has spent so much time dealing with it.  I want to glean something from his experience of it.  As he has outlined, it has taken more than seven years for it to be comprehensively ratified and it still has a long way to go.  To expand on that conversation, I have a question about the situation in America, one of our larger export markets.  How realistic are the claims that America will agree to a trade agreement with Britain in a number of weeks?   The delegates have great experience.  As they have dealt with the CETA and everything else, I am curious about their opinions on both of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#F01200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>We have not identified pitfalls in the CETA agreement, save to say if we did not have it, those involved in some sectors of the economy would be denied access to markets.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are all the time calling on firms to diversify and get into new markets.  One part of the equation is the work Enterprise Ireland does in helping firms to identify target markets.  The other part is identifying the tariffs their goods will face in these markets and what other behind the border barriers they will face.  We have to work on the terms of trade, as well as facilitating individual companies.  The world around us is negotiating trade agreements.  Will we step aside from taking part when our entire output requires the export of beef, services, pharma-chem products and ICT equipment?  We are exporting far more than the domestic market could support in these areas of specialism and high value.  The danger to us lies in not taking part and not liberalising and taking advantage of the opportunities when the economy and individual firms have shown how well they can compete.  The danger posed by the agreement is that Irish firms will be out-competed by other member states and their companies or will not be equipped to avail of these market opening opportunities.  It will come down to individual firms identifying market opportunities in Canada in public procurement for software, medical devices etc.  My confidence comes from the Irish firms which throughout the huge recession managed to lead recovery through export-led growth.  It will involve not being left behind.  Trade openness tends to stimulate innovation in the economy.  The pressure of competing with other countries and firms to sell in Canada will stimulate innovation and, therefore, sustainability in Irish firms.

That requires recognition of professional qualifications and that we allow people move across the Border to look for and deliver those services.  It requires mutual recognition of safety testing, product standards and a range of very complicated issues over which sometimes, including in the United States, central government does not have control.  In other words, there are state level regulators who determine the standards.  For the United States Administration, either in public procurement or regulatory standards in the US, to Sherpa and all of the state level interests, it is extremely complex.  It is possible to do a deal relatively quickly with the United Kingdom, perhaps in a short number of years.

That is the tip of an iceberg that has been reflected in some of the commentary here already in terms of the concerns about this deal that unforeseen advantage may be given to outside multinational companies that could take advantage of the situation here to our detriment.  To cut to the chase, I would be grateful if Mr. Kelly would outline the position, taking specifically public health policy on tobacco.  From what he said already, it would appear to me that if something is banned in this country and across the European Union, or even not across the entire EU, our laws prevail and nothing within this agreement can undermine those laws.  Mr. Kelly's colleague, Ms Benson, is nodding in assent but it would help everybody if Mr. Kelly could lay that out in terms of the tobacco industry in particular in which there are several actors.  There is a market here already.  They will now have to comply with new arrangements to do with plain packaging, to mention but one aspect that may come down the track in the future.  He might highlight how he would see those provisions that we have put in our public health policy to protect public health from the deadly threat tobacco represents, with 6,000 Irish people dying every year from tobacco related illnesses and 700,000 people dying across Europe, not being undermined.  That would reassure me, and I am fairly reassured already.  While I accept all the arguments Mr. Kelly has made, it would also demonstrate clearly how this agreement cannot undermine our laws, our Constitution and any policy this Oireachtas would put into law, and that it is not discriminatory against one provider of a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484668800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>One does not have to go far overseas to see that.  One only has to look around the European Union, whether it is to do with plain packaging or something else, to see there is a diversity of views.  However, to refer to this deal, the agreement sets out the European Union and member states' right to regulate in the public interest and specifically talks about doing that with regard to the promotion of public health, social services, public education, safety, environment, public morals, social or consumer protection, privacy and data protection, and cultural diversity.  That is in the joint interpretative declaration which, as the Senator knows, has the same status as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, under the Vienna Convention.  The treaty states that the Government has a right to regulate in the public interest but there is always a debate internationally about what is the public interest.  In the past, we and the Senator have fought that fight both at the World Trade Organization, WTO, and elsewhere where people tried to challenge issues like plain packaging.  It is important that that is seen to be in the public interest and that there is an evidence base for those actions.  As far as I am concerned, however, both in the text of the agreement and in the joint interpretation that Canada and the European Union have put as an integral part of the agreement, they restate for the avoidance of doubt the state's right to regulate in the interest of the public and, in particular, public health.  I do not see scope for that issue to be unravelled as it stands in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I call Senator Higgins and thank her for attending today.

I appreciate the opportunity to be here and thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation.  Before I ask a question, I want to pick up on one point.  We have been hearing of the benefits but Mr. Kelly mentioned our own research.  The only research we know we have in Ireland is that Ireland asked, regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is a similar agreement, that the Copenhagen institute would do research.  The benefits it found for Ireland, in terms of economic growth, were 0.01% per year.  When the European Commission and the Canadian Government did research into the potential benefits of CETA, they came up with 0.01% of economic growth as the potential economic benefit.  It is important that we keep those figures in mind because some of the figures we saw relating to South Korea etc. may have been slightly inflationary.  The figures from the European Commission are much closer to the figures we saw from the employment committee.  They are quite low compared with the figures relating to South Korea.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, further research would be beneficial in that small firms will benefit.  Except with regard to assumed benefits in terms of navigation of paperwork etc., it would be good to look to similar agreements between equal partners such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the extent to which small firms have or have not benefited versus larger corporations.  If Mr. Kelly had information on that, I would be very interested to see it.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask two questions, the first of which concerns the negative list mentioned.  It is quite a short list for Ireland.  Germany has an 18-page list, but what is interesting about the German list is that it also excludes a large number of areas of legal provision and it states that those areas are not affected or impacted by the Bill.  It seems Germany took quite a different approach in terms of exclusions.  While Mr. Kelly mentioned the European exclusions, it is interesting that other countries still felt they needed to put in additional exclusions.  A question arises in that regard from which it would be important to learn.<\/p> <p>  There are also concerns regarding some of the European level exclusions Mr. Kelly mentioned.  Has a proofing exercise taken place with regard to each of those in terms of our public services in each of the areas mentioned, for example, transport, health and others?  There has been some ambiguity about what is considered a service of general interest and whether the services we provide meet the standards for exclusion.  In some cases recently, Ireland has been told that we do not meet the standards for exclusion, perhaps because there is a private actor also operating in an area.  The proofing exercise that might have taken place in regard to that is important.<\/p> <p>  There is also concern about what is called the ratchet clause, a phrase not in the Bill, in that if an area is in public delivery currently, it would seem, from looking at CETA and the text, that if an area were privatised, it would be very difficult to return it to public delivery.  It seems the only changes that can take place regarding service delivery are to increase the openness and private access.  What would be the impact of reversing a sector, as it were?  How would Mr. Kelly see that as being possible?  For example, in terms of experiments such as those that have taken place in the Department of Social Protection where it has outsourced certain contracts and services, if it wanted to take that back into public delivery again, how might that work?<\/p> <p>  I believe this is important, and I would like to hear Mr. Kelly's comments on it, because the negative list is a new process that has never been done previously.<\/p><p>We have never had a negative list system whereby that which is not explicitly excluded is included.  We are in a new zone here.  It is important to recognise this is not standard practice but a new practice.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses.<\/p><p> With regard to the investor court system, the witnesses mentioned that it is an opt-in.  It is, of course, not an opt-out so states that sign up, if this is finally ratified, will not have an option to opt out from it.  When the witnesses say it is a choice, the choice is only on the part of the corporation as to whether or not to choose to access this mechanism.  It is not a choice for states.  It is also important to clarify that indigenous companies would not be able to access this mechanism within Ireland and, similarly, citizens and governments would have no access to it.  This is entirely a mechanism which can be initiated and activated by corporations and companies, if I am correct, whereas the interpretative instrument mentioned by the witnesses and the committees mentioned do not have any of the same teeth.  The witnesses can perhaps correct me on that.<\/p><p> The interpretative instrument was added to with the very belated inclusion of the Vienna convention and its committees some seven hours before the proposed signing.  What mechanisms do the witnesses believe states would have through those committees if there were concerns in regard to issues such as the environment, employment rights and equality rights?  What would be the enforcement mechanisms?  We know the mechanism of the investor court system, which has the power to demand compensation, as the witnesses put it very explicitly.  Nobody is suggesting that states would lose the right to regulate but the key point is that states having the right to regulate would now come with a compensatory cost.  As was said, future unearned profit may not be the reason that can be put forward but another reason may be put forward.  If we look at dispute mechanisms around the world, the evidence is that the bar has been quite low.  With regard to climate change, during the case currently being taken against the United States in regard to the oil pipeline, it was stated that citing climate change as an issue of public interest was considered an inadequate defence and that the company should still be compensated.  A case is ongoing in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#G00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Senator might conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017011700002#H00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1484668800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I want to ask one concrete question in regard to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.

As we are trying to entice inward investment, we are providing a special mechanism to them rather than offering them 28 different constitutions and national laws by which they might try to vindicate their rights.
