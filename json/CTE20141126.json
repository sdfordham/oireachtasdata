This will benefit approximately 28,000 working one-parent family payment recipients in 2015 at a cost of &euro;8 million.  This measure will be funded within my Department's existing allocation for 2015.<br\/>Budget 2012 provided for the phased reduction over a five-year period in the weekly earnings disregard applying to recipients of one-parent family payment from its pre-2012 level of &euro;146.50 to &euro;60 in 2016.  This, in effect, reduced the amount of earnings that a lone parent could earn before it has an impact on his or her payment.  These reductions were required in order to achieve savings in my Department's Estimate in line with commitments to reduce the overall Government deficit.  However, I recognise that many lone parents have asked that the reductions not be continued further whereas the effect of budget 2012 would be further reductions.  If the proposed January 2015 reduction was implemented, that would have reduced the disregard by net of &euro;7.50 per week.  I am, therefore, bringing forward this amendment to ensure the one-parent family payment earnings disregard is maintained at its current level of &euro;90 per week.  This will protect the existing financial incentive for working lone parents to remain in employment.  I said at the time I would keep this under constant review.<br\/>As part of these amendments, I am also providing for the inclusion of the standard definition of the term &quot;Principal Act&quot; in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600003#B00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1417006800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendment.

However, the good news does not appear to have reached my constituency yet, judging by the reaction I am getting from people up to this morning.<\/p><p>  I welcome the amendment and the fact that the disregard is being maintained at &euro;90.  Originally there was a much higher disregard and the Minister is proceeding apace with the other changes to lone parents allowance, which means that a person must have a child under the age of seven before qualifying for lone parents allowance, otherwise the alternative is jobseeker's allowance.  I accept that some of those changes were signalled before the Minister took office but that does not mean I agree with them.  She mentioned that more and more lone parents are going out to work.  I thought the idea of this was to encourage people to go out to work.  If the means test is applied to a person claiming jobseeker's allowance as opposed to a person claiming lone parent's allowance the means test is more generous from the point of view of lone parent's allowance.  That means that the changes being introduced make it is less attractive financially for lone parents to go out to work.<\/p><p>  If the Government's objective is to encourage people, such as lone parents, to go out to work, many of whom are in low paid jobs or can only take up part-time work because of the cost of child care, I do see how they are encouraged to do so by taking more and more off their earnings as a result of going to work.  The rate of jobseeker's allowance is the same as the basic rate of lone parent's allowance.  Therefore, the only people who are adversely affected by the changes which are being introduced are lone parents who go out to work, that is the element of their income that is affected.  If they stay at home they will be in the same position as a person on jobseeker's allowance.  While I welcome the change and do not propose to oppose it I would point out that a result of these changes it is that it is becoming less attractive financially for lone parents to go out to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600004#C00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1417007100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcomed this provision on Second Stage when the announcement was made.  I had raised the issue with the Minister only a few days prior to that.  At that stage the announcement had not been made.  It is clearly welcome.  It was a pity the Minister did not take the opportunity to reverse the original cut made to the income disregard from &euro;146.50 down to &euro;90 as that was a substantial cut which affected lone parents to the tune of about &euro;28 per week.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the people who are affected are lone parents who go back to work.  In the main many of them, initially, are those who are working in low paid part-time work, but not exclusively so.  They are the people who are affected by the changes.  Will the Minister give an indication if it is the intention to go beyond this and to consider reversing the original cut, which was substantial and ensured that many of those in the lone parents grouping, the one parent families, were at risk of poverty?  I quoted the figures at the time.  This group has the highest consistent poverty rate of more than 17% and a rate of deprivation of almost 50%.  Any cut to their income or any changes to the provisions within the social welfare code which affect them can have a detrimental affect.  While this one is not a cut, it does not undo a previous cut.  We are talking about young people because they are people who will be affected, the children of lone parents.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 seeks to delete the title \"The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005\" and substitute \"The Principal Act\".

I am aware the Minister does not rule them out of order.  As I managed to get one included which has not been ruled out, I think I have achieved a miracle.  In order that people know, amendments are ruled out of order on the basis that they impose a potential charge on the Exchequer or are not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  That makes it very difficult for Opposition or backbench Deputies to make progressive or radical proposals, whichever they wish, which are realistic.  It makes our job difficult.  Even where we are trying to change legislation to give positive effect, sometimes we are hampered.  I want the public to understand that we do make the effort.  If the Minister sees any amendments that are useful and that she would have been inclined to take on board, she may indicate that from the list.  We will come to them when dealing with the different sections.<\/p><p>  It is important that the income disregard, which was set up in the first instance because the State had recognised the level of deprivation and sometimes disconnect among this group of people, be reviewed to ensure if at all possible that it is reinstated to its full limit.

Now we are talking about &euro;90.  There has been a huge cut for those affected.  There will be a huge sigh of relief that it is not being cut more.  It should be viewed in that context.  I agree with the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I would have liked to have seen it increased by even more to protect people who need the protection.  It is not as if they are in a situation where they are looking for handouts.  They want to work.  The issue is the type of work that is available.  The figures show that Ireland is the third best country for jobs but this is made up of zero hour contracts and underemployment.  I would like to see a further breakdown of the employment figures and where it is the jobs are being created.  We do not see these jobs in my area.  I do not have people attending my clinic saying they got a job that day or that they had been on the unemployment register for the last six years and that they have now got a job.  There was only one such person in the last three months.  I do not see where it is coming from.  It does not appear to be affecting or trickling into communities.<\/p><p>  This group of people in particular are in constant poverty.  The deprivation figures are available.

We hear of businesses such as the one in Waterford in the news recently potentially closing down with 17 jobs going and 100 children possibly affected.  <\/p><p>  There is huge concern in regard to the cost of child care in this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600005#D00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1417007700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.

I know enough people in the Deputy's constituency to know that there are many people in that area going back to work.  They may not all go to the Deputy and tell her they are going back to work.  However, the figures show they are.  That is something we should all celebrate.<\/p><p>  This leads me to make a certain comment on people parenting on their own.  This is the challenge for all of us - as Deputies, the Minister and the Department.  We have had allowances for single women in Ireland going back over a long period of time. It was Frank Cluskey, who became leader of the Labour Party, who introduced them in the early 1970s.  This was revolutionary in its day.  There were many single daughters, particularly on farms, who had no income at all.  The Labour Party did this.  It was called the unmarried mother's allowance at the time.  Prisoners' wives - who would have been parenting on their own - and the now quaintly named deserted wives got payments.  <\/p><p>  The State and all of the political parties supported this.  The State therefore has, compared with other countries, a very high level of support for lone parents.  I know countries that the Deputy admires such as Greece give almost no support in these situations.  However, we should look at the long-range figures on how families get employment.  The biggest predictor of the problem has been identified.  It is very good if a family has a social welfare income support.<\/p><p>  It is good that we have a strong social welfare base.  However, children in a family do better if a parent or the parents in the family get employment.  I have been involved in community work for a very long period of time.  My experience is that in terms of high level, middle level and low level jobs available in Ireland - which are becoming available in increasing numbers - the best route back to well paid, secure, sustainable employment is to get further education, qualifications and training.  Deputy O'Dea and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh reference people parenting on their own.  In countries with strong social welfare systems - particularly Nordic and middle European countries such as Germany, Austria and Holland - the support system encourages parents, particularly parents parenting on their own, to take up training, education and work experience opportunities as a way to getting good jobs.  That is my policy.  <\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea questioned the change to seven years of age.  There is international evidence on this. I also know this from my own personal knowledge and experience of people parenting on their own.  It is a hard struggle to raise children on one's own, regardless of income.  The aim is to get people back into education.  Setting the age at seven years and having a transition to the lone parent's transitional payment is designed to encourage people back into education.  If a person can get a job which they want immediately, so much the better.  However, it is the transition into education, training and work experience that helps people get a better paid job.  All the evidence shows that it improves the opportunities and life chances for their children.  In many Scandinavian countries where there are very strong supports the return to education age is when the child is one years old.  <\/p><p>  I looked at the models in countries such as the UK and Northern Ireland.  Our welfare payments are much higher than the payments in the UK and Northern Ireland.  However, they have a back-to-education structure and they use the age of seven.  The evidence is that a child is well settled in school at that stage.  A child will have completed a pre-school year and the junior and senior infant's years.  By the time we are asking parents to transition, their youngest child should be well settled in school.  As the Deputies know themselves, it is at the point the child is well settled into school that a person has an opportunity to look at doing some other things, whether in a two parent or in one parent household.  <\/p><p>  I know there is a difference in views.  Perhaps we agree on the objective - we want to see lone parents having an opportunity going back to work.  However, having access to education is the key to getting well paid work.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> With regard to the data on jobless households, a lot of such households are headed by people who are parenting on their own.  That is why I introduced these reforms as a way of helping lone parents primarily to get back into education.  Such parents may have been parenting on their own for seven years if they have just one child, or perhaps double or triple that time if they have more than one child.<\/p><p> I have worked in this area and it is a big confidence issue to have been in a domestic situation, notwithstanding how hard people work, and re-enter the world of work.  Usually the easiest path is to go through education, training and community support.  The Department supports 1,000 community employment schemes around the country.  As members of the committee know, they are a great gateway back into work and obtaining qualifications in a range of areas.  <\/p><p> I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh about the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill.  We will be able to send him and other Deputies an email copy of that.  As I said, however, regarding bells and whistles, we have to wait until we get a little bit better off as a country.<\/p><p> Budget information and debate are important issues in terms of D&aacute;il reform.  I have always made myself available to this committee for fairly lengthy discussions.  The Department of Social Protection consults with a wide range of voluntary and community groups.  We hold several individual and group sessions throughout the year.  We also have a significant number of stakeholder forums within the Department.  On any major change we invite all the organisations that are either specifically assisting groups of people or advocating for them.<\/p><p> On 4 July, the day on which I was elected Leader of the Labour Party, I started early that morning on a pre-budget forum with about 40 advocate groups.  They strongly informed the decisions I took concerning social welfare budget changes.  First, for instance, older people in particular wanted no changes to the weekly rate.  That request came from all groups across the board.  Second, they also wanted assurances on security for the free travel pass.  Third, the next biggest demand was the restoration in whole or in part of the Christmas bonus.  That is exactly what I did in the budget, so the pre-budget discussion has been incredibly important.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that there should be an opportunity for more detailed discussions and that is something that we can perhaps progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600005#D00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417008300,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I would like to refer to something the T&aacute;naiste mentioned.

The first thing a politician says about somebody in a relationship is not whether he or she is married.  There is an intense amount of stereotyping among some people in the political class.  They may talk about a person and their children as being determined by their parent's status.  That status is defined by many politicians - who do not think about it enough, if I may say so - as being a lone parent.  One does not find somebody being characterised as a married or co-habiting person, although one may find people who have been widowed and lost their partner being defined in that sense.<\/p><p>  We need to see opportunity spread across society.  I personally know many people who at one time or another have parented on their own.  They have gone on to get first-class training and education, as Deputy Conaghan said.

To recall for the benefit of Deputy Willie O'Dea, it included the abolition of the Christmas bonus in 2009, weekly reductions in all working age welfare payments in 2010 and 2011 and weekly reductions in jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer's allowance, carer's benefit, one parent family payment, the back to education allowance, illness benefit, the supplementary allowance and others.  Most elements of the treatment benefit schemes were discontinued by the previous Government, illness benefit was limited to two years for new claimants and the entitlements to jobseeker's benefit was reduced.  The cumulative reduction in the weekly payments mentioned was just over &euro;16 per week.  The Deputy has reflected on all of that.  These were the most difficult reductions for people.  The debate on the issue is probably more suited to a discussion on the Estimates, which will be taken under a revision is ready.  I presume this will be some time in January or early February and we can then examine the reductions overseen by Deputy Willie O'Dea as a Minister in the previous Government.  I have succeeded in reducing the impact of them.  I have been able to maintain the weekly rate.  In terms of the discussions we have with people interested in social welfare, that is the measure that gets the strongest mention.  As the economy goes into recovery, we have seen in this year's budget a modest &euro;200 million social welfare package that has allowed targeted improvements for different groups that rely on social affairs.  This includes the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, which will be paid from next week on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600007#F01400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1417008900,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I am concerned about the reduction brought about by the previous Government and equally concerned by the reductions brought about by this Government.  The Government is trumpeting that it has put &euro;196 million back into social welfare but it has taken out almost &euro;2 billion.  The T&aacute;naiste outlined the cuts made by the previous Government yet not one of them, with the exception of one small example, have been reversed.  I find it peculiar that the T&aacute;naiste says the general cry in the feedback is the maintenance of rates.  Is there not a commitment in the programme for Government to retain the rates?  Why would people be worried that rates would not be retained?  Is it that people do not believe Government commitments?  We can hardly blame them for that in view of the fact that so many of them have been broken.  Groups representing the senior citizens parliament and the elderly met us and were concerned about the cuts in the fuel allowance, which have not been restored.  We heard lurid tales about peoples staying in bed for 12 hours to get a bit of heat.  People have to turn off the heat at certain times because electricity prices are so expensive.  They also talked about the slashing of free ESB allowances.  People talked about elderly people being isolated because they lost the free telephone rental allowance.  In some cases, they had to give up a landline and there is no change in that.<\/p> <p>We heard from people who told us they were carers and worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, contributing &euro;70 million per week to this country.  Without that contribution, the 3% deficit target would still be out of sight.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has an amendment to reflect their request for the restoration of the respite care grant.  There is no sign of that.  The respite care grant is not a bonus payment, such as that received by the people at Irish Water, but rather a payment to enable people who are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to care for loved ones, often at the expense of their own health, to get a reasonable break.  The Government took away 25% of that payment.  People have been crying about that.<\/p><p> If we examine the budget speeches of both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the word \"carers\" is not featured once.  In my amendment I wanted to highlight that all those changes have been made on top of previously made changes.  None of these has been reversed, and although I welcome the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, I have not met anybody who put it at the head of the agenda.  The Government decided that what little money it had would be spent in that area in order to reach as many potential voters as possible.<\/p><p> My amendment simply asks for an analysis of what has been taken from people so this and future Governments will know where are the priorities if there is money available.  I am told we cannot debate this because of a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I could do it free of charge, so there would be no charge on the Exchequer.  There is no demand for it to be done today or immediately.

The &euro;5 restoration to child benefit each month does not do anything to offset the &euro;400 million taken annually since 2009.  It is a substantial cost.  In the Minister's budget speech, it was mentioned that this was the first of two steps, with the second step coming next year.  Why is that not set in legislation, as we have the opportunity to indicate there will be an additional &euro;5 paid in 2016?  That is strange, although there may be a technical reason.  The measure was announced but I am concerned that like many announcements, what is said might see no follow-up.  As Deputy O'Dea noted, perhaps the promise might not be kept.<\/p><p>  This issue regards cuts in social welfare such as child benefit but particularly those payments which affect lone parents and children.  Others have mentioned the promise of introducing the Scandinavian model of child care.  I will raise the matter now as we have been discussing child benefit.  Some people manage to use child benefit to offset costs and the Government had the opportunity to address the substantial cost of child care in this State, or at least try to help people in that way.  The European Commission in June this year indicated that Ireland has the highest fees in the European Union for early childhood education and care for children under three years old.  According to the OECD figures from earlier this year, Ireland is one of two of the most expensive countries in the world for child care, with the average family with two children spending 40% of the average wage on child care costs.  These costs are even higher in Dublin, although I will not get into a debate about Dublin versus the rest of the country.  The costs are unsustainable.<\/p><p>  I welcome the increase in the number of people going to work but many of these people will see major challenges in dealing with child care costs.  A discouraging factor for unemployed people with child care issues - whether lone parents or in cases where there is a mother and father in the family - is that costs are the same.  The child benefit in no way covers that cost, especially considering what it is in Dublin and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>Are there plans to address it, as none were announced on budget day or since?  Is there a plan to increase the number of months or years for free child care places?  Is child benefit the only mechanism through which there will be some relief to those who have had other benefits cut?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600008#G03200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417010100,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Two measures in the budget are relevant to people with children, aside from the discussion we just had on people parenting on their own.  The first is the increase payment of &euro;5 a month to each child in receipt of child benefit.  There is a commitment for a further increase of &euro;5 in the next budget if resources permit.  It is important to keep that caveat in mind.  The economy is in recovery which we need to sustain.  I cannot commit to significant promises until I see how resources go.  With this morning&rsquo;s announcement about the increased numbers in work, the outlook continues to be extremely positive.  We know, however, there are growth difficulties in the eurozone which could impact on us.  I am confident we will be able to meet that commitment.<\/p><p>  The other development in the budget, specifically targeted at families with children is the back to work family dividend.  This provision will be introduced in social welfare legislation next spring and enacted sometime before Easter.  Someone in long-term unemployment who goes back to work will retain, through the family dividend on a sliding scale, the weekly payments they received from social welfare in respect of each qualified child increase payment which comes to under &euro;30 a week.  We have an extra 7,000 construction workers back at work.  Taking that example, a construction worker with three qualifying children who was long-term unemployed will retain &euro;90 per week of social welfare payments, in addition to family income supplement, FIS.  In this year&rsquo;s budget, we also made a significant additional provision for increased spending on FIS.  As a consequence of the updating of the IT for the payment, we now have 44,000 families receiving the supplement in respect of 100,000 children.<\/p><p>  All of us identify that families with children face significant burdens and challenges.  I have always been a strong advocate for child benefit.  It is paid directly to the caring parent, usually the mother.  All of the evidence is that it is well spent on behalf of children.  It goes to people in work and, importantly, the self-employed.  In the case of a formerly self-employed person who has not got back to work, the cash flow from child benefit has been critically important to their families.  The targeted back to work family dividend for the long-term unemployed going back to work ensures they receive qualifying child payments fully for one year and half for the second.  This will be strong encouragement next year, along with the expanded FIS, to make the transition from social welfare back to work.  When a person goes back to work, often they may start at a low pay level.  These supports will, hopefully, smooth this transition for them so that it is absolutely clear from our system that working always pays.  Every member recognises the social and financial, as well as the other, advantages of going back to work.  When one is leaving the certainty of social welfare, however, for the relative uncertainty of the jobs market, even though one&rsquo;s income potential is much higher, it can be a difficult transition.  I am anxious to help families in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600009#H00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010100,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have an estimate of how much the back to work family dividend will cost the Department this year?

We anticipate it will rise again next year.  In all of the early discussions I had when we were improving the Department&rsquo;s IT platforms, we noted getting on FIS was complex and awkward for recipients in approaching employers about it.  All of that has improved significantly.  Up to 48,493 families are on FIS for the end to this year which covers nearly 108,000 children.

That is a very significant expenditure in terms of back to work supports.  Social commentators have acknowledged that the spending is targeted at people in low-income households.

When the Minister came to office and took up the portfolio of social protection, one of the first issues we dealt with as a committee was that of a single work-related payment.  At the time the Department decided to reduce the number of schemes in order that they would be more manageable.  In order not to create new schemes we called them add-ons, and here is another add-on which I do not oppose.  Anything that helps people who are going back to work and have struggled for years is to be welcomed.  Child benefit could have been increased by &euro;10 and the same people would have benefited.  Some of their payments would have increased but perhaps not to the same degree.  The increase would have restored child benefit more directly.  Changing some of the FIS thresholds would have had the effect of putting more money in people's pockets rather than creating a new payment called the back to work family dividend.  I do not oppose add-ons, which have always existed.  I am not making an ideological argument for one or the other.  I just find this strange given where we were three years ago.  According to the Department, we had to reduce the number of schemes and we were told the move was dictated by the troika.  We were told the troika was unimpressed with the number of schemes here and wanted a more simplified social welfare code.  Is the new scheme our way of telling the troika that now it is gone we will go back to looking at producing schemes which address problems and issues as they emerge, which will hopefully help people by providing the social transfer that is required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600010#J00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010700,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I want to revise a figure.  I confirm that the FIS spending figure for next year will be &euro;350 million.<\/p><p>  We did have these discussions and our dear departed advisers may have had a lot of ideas on how to simplify things.  We examined all the ideas.  My overwhelming political priority is to get people back to work.  The reform of the FIS scheme has made FIS much easier to avail of.  Also, it is simpler, the response rate is rapid and there is an awful lot more information available on FIS.  As a consequence, we are now talking about 100,000 children and 48,000 families benefitting from the scheme.<\/p><p>  Let me be very clear about the reason for the back to work dividend.  When I was previously involved in the Department I developed a back to work scheme which was strongly supported by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods.  The scheme lasted for a long period and it was highly successful on the ground, particularly in local communities.  I have been very anxious to develop a number of targeted schemes which give people an up-front incentive to transit from unemployment to work.  I hope that the back to work family dividend will be one such initiative.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy said, there were proposals on the troika menu in areas such as disability.  The proposals were left in a menu of previous agreements between the previous Government and the troika.  We examined the proposals but I was not convinced of their merit, although the previous Government was convinced.  The consequences for individuals and families could potentially, in some cases, have been extremely severe.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600010#J00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010700,"counter":91,"content":"<p>The increase in FIS spending arises simply because more of the people entitled to it will claim for it.

Recently, at the launch of the MABS report in Ballyfermot, representatives from the National Traveller MABS raised with me a consequence of the discontinuation of a facility which allowed for the deduction of loan repayments from social welfare payments.  This was a loan guarantee scheme but it was not done willy-nilly.  The scheme had developed over several years.  In recent years the National Traveller MABS established a loan guarantee scheme to support Travellers in accessing affordable and mainstream credit through their local credit unions.  The idea was to tackle loan sharks and so on, but also to help as part of the household budget scheme.  The scheme has been discontinued and this is causing some problems.  The National Traveller MABS has identified some of the problems for Travellers who get into difficulty.<br\/>The National Traveller MABS produced a report in September - I am unsure whether the Minister has seen it - calling on the household budget scheme to be extended to include what the service terms the Lough payment scheme.  The name for the scheme emerged because it was jointly managed with the Lough Credit Union in Cork and the Cork MABS.  It was extended beyond these organisations, and 25 MABS services supported 400 clients in paying debt via the scheme.  The scheme is now at an end.  Examples of the debts that were being paid but that cannot now be deducted include credit union loans, Garda fines and payments to private debt companies - for example, if people bought furniture on the never-never - as well as money owed to private landlords.<br\/>I gather at the moment only one or two types of payment can be deducted from a social welfare payment, including local authority rents and repayments to the Department.  Will the Minister examine the matter?  If is too late for this legislation then, at the very least, the scheme could be introduced in other forthcoming legislation - the Minister mentioned February.  It is not simply a willy-nilly scheme.  It took some time to work out and it had been working well.  At the moment a person can make an arrangement for utilities to be deducted from social welfare payments as well.<br\/>Anyway, the National Traveller MABS is seeking a change such that if a credit union agrees to give a loan to clear a debt then the loan could be deducted.  The report is available.  This was raised at the first engagement by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  He would have been aware of it because people from the service managed to talk to him on the day as well.  That is my appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600011#K00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1417011300,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.

I raised the matter with the Minister in April this year, as did several other Deputies.  The idea was not only to help them to pay debts but also to assist in the purchase of caravans or in getting across to England for funerals.  Loans were given to people and they worked with the group to pay them back.  It was a detrimental step by the Department of Social Protection to cut the link and remove the ability of MABS to provide the service to certain people who were not linked into banks or to the technology that we are linked into.  Many of the people in question may be illiterate, and they need support services in that area as well.<\/p><p>  I fully support the amendment.  If the T&aacute;naiste cannot accept it now, will she set out what she can do in future or what she plans to do in a constructive way to allow MABS and the Lough payment scheme to facilitate people who need this low-key, short-term access to moneys?

I want to give one example, but I am sure there are many more.  In a recent appeal case involving a disability payment the appeal was lodged on 18 June, but a reply was not received until 18 October.  The reply was that there was an administrative issue and that the appeal had lapsed.  It took us four months to get a reply stating the appeal should not have been made in the first place because of the length of time that had elapsed since the original application had been made.  That is not good enough.  The amendment seeks to put in place the words &quot;a prescribed time of 60 working days from the date of receipt of the appeal&quot; in which a decision should be made.  That is an adequate amount of time in which it should be able to decide on an appeal.  Paragraphs (b) and (c) seek to insert caveats to make sure an appeals officer would work within this time period.  While the Minister has said there have been improvements, this is crucial.  The example I have given shows the current provision is not good enough in that it took four months for an appeals officer to get back to say the appeal had lapsed.  In that case, it had nothing to do with the appeal or the medical reasons advanced and the person concerned had to start from scratch again, which means that they are now in a worse position than they were five or eight months ago.  I, therefore, propose that the amendment be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600012#L00400","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1417011900,"counter":124,"content":"<p>This is a version of a Private Members' Bill I advanced recently.  Unfortunately, the Government did not think it could accept it.  It proposes that, from the time a social welfare appeal is made, there be a maximum of 60 working days - 12 working weeks - in which a decision should be made.  The information available to me is that in the period from October 2013 to September 2014 there were some 34,000 cases.  In other words, in 34,000 cases the decision of the deciding officer was challenged.  Some 19,000 or 56% of these cases succeeded, which is very good from the point of view of the appeals office, but it also means that in 56% of cases, the deciding officer had got it wrong initially.<\/p><p>  While I accept and appreciate that the length of time for determining an appeal has been reduced, the position still remains, on the latest figures, that the average length of time taken to process case involving an oral hearing is 29.3 weeks, which is over seven months.  In a case involving a summary decision, where there is no oral hearing, the average time is 21.8 weeks, which is about five months.  There are two points to be made.  First, these are average figures and, in some instances, the appeal can take much longer to process.  Second, in 56% of cases people effectively have been wronged, in that a wrong decision has been made.<\/p><p>  The theory is that if somebody applies for a social welfare payment and he or she is turned down and makes an appeal, he or she is entitled to receive supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime to tide him or her over.  In many instances, including in several cases I have come across, supplementary welfare allowance is not granted.  This is no small thing.  For example, I am dealing with a person who was turned down for receipt of carer's allowance - for what reason I do not know - after an initial delay of six months.  We are now into the seventh month and the appeal has not yet been determined.  The person in question has no other source of income.  One will find that, in many cases, supplementary welfare allowance is not payable and the people concerned have no other source of income for extended periods.  They have to rely on the generosity of their families or the charity of their friends, many of whom can ill afford it.<\/p><p>  All I am trying to do is to shorten the waiting period.  I appreciate and accept that it has been shortened, but we are still talking about a period of 13 months for a person who is a carer.  I recently came across a case involving an invalidity pension appeal which took up to 15 months to process.  It is a very serious matter for the people concerned that they do not have any compensating income in the meantime and are literally in penury.  I do not know whether the Government can accept the amendment today.  However, I ask the Minister to look as favourably as possible at introducing some time limit because when people come to us, we have to say the average period of waiting is so long and that that is the length of time the person concerned could be waiting.  If there was a cut-off point to which we could point, it would relieve a lot of the anxiety and uncertainty suffered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600012#L00500","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1417011900,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The social welfare appeals process operates on a statutory basis and social welfare appeals officers are required to be quasi-judicial in performing their functions.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office, therefore, operates independently of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that processing times for appeals do not relate solely to the time taken for the Social Welfare Appeals Office to consider appeals.  Appeals processing times take account of all stages of the review and appeals process.  When an appeal is submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, the Department is requested to provide details of the case and the extent to which the facts advanced by the person applying are admitted or are disputed.  At this point, the Department reviews the original decision in the light of the facts and evidence submitted as part of the appeal in order to decide whether the original decision should be revised in favour of the person appealing.  In the case of illness, disability and caring-related payments, the time taken to review a case will normally include a review by a different medical assessor.  Whether the substance of the appeal involves the assessment of means or whether any of the other conditions of entitlement is satisfied, the matter may require investigation and a further visit by a social welfare inspector.<\/p><p>  All of the activity I have outlined - the standard procedure of the Department - takes time, as the Deputy will appreciate.  However, it gives the person making the application a series of opportunities to strengthen his or her case along the way.  This is hugely in favour of the person making the application and demonstrates the strong flexibility built into the system, as I have pointed out to Deputies on a number of occasions.  I know that all of the Deputies present handle a very large volume of social welfare queries.  One of the problems is that, for a variety of reasons, people do not submit sufficient information at the time they make their applications.  Very often, it is when public representatives meet people and suggest they will help them with their applications that they provide additional supporting evidence or documentation.  We allow this very elaborate examination of the case made and, in many cases, it works strongly to the benefit of applicants.  Is the Deputy suggesting we should do away with this?  Our system is unique; this does not happen in other jurisdictions in the detailed way in which it happens here.  We would possibly end up having far more appeals disallowed.  As the Deputies know from handling constituents' cases, very often, even when they believe they know all about them, some piece of significant information has not been advised to them.  When they find out, perhaps by talking to another family member or in an overall review of their own information, they are able to make a much stronger case.<\/p> <p>I will set out some examples.  Some 21% of the 38,000 appeals in 2013 were revised by the Department during the review stage when the Department can submit information to the appeals office.  This is very much in favour of the person making the application.  Following the review, if the original decision is still unchanged, the appeal can then be advanced by an appeals officer either on a summary or an oral basis.  In the case of oral appeal hearings approximately six weeks can be added to the process as the necessary arrangements must be made in scheduling the appeal.  At any time during this process, up to and including the morning of the hearing of an appeal, an appellant, a person applying, can submit additional information, allowing the opportunity to strengthen his or her case.<\/p><p> I fully acknowledge that during the period from 2010 to 2013, there were unacceptable delays in the appeal process due to the unprecedented increase in appeal numbers.  This placed considerable pressures on the office.  I have reported on the matter to the social protection spokespeople in the D&aacute;il on many occasions.<\/p><p> Prior to 2009, before the great crash and the great recession, the average number of appeals received by the Department per year was in the region of 15,000.  By 2012 the appeals receipts had more than doubled at 35,500.  As a consequence of the vast number of people who lost their jobs in the wake of the bank guarantee and the construction crash brought about by the previous Government, there was a major increase in the numbers of people claiming a variety of social welfare entitlements.  My predecessor, the then Minister, could tell the Deputy that the numbers of applications and appeals increased dramatically.<\/p><p> The numbers of appeals currently being received are rather high.  In 2013, the social welfare appeals office received a total of 32,000 appeals, the second highest number of appeals since the office was established in 1990.  Considerable effort and many resources have been devoted to reforming and improving the appeals system.  An extra 15 appeals officers have been appointed, with ten former community welfare service appeals officers joining the social welfare appeals office after I became Minister.  This brought the total number of appeals officers in 2011 to 41 at a time when, as the Deputies are aware, the reductions in staff throughout the public service with early retirements and so on were significant.<\/p><p> A new operating model was introduced aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system and eliminating delays at various stages of the process.  We have had detailed discussions on this previously.  I am thankful to the Deputies for acknowledging the work of the staff in improving the appeals process times.  The time taken for an appeal involving an oral hearing dropped from 52 weeks to 29 weeks by the end of October 2014, a significant reduction of almost six months.  The time taken for summary decisions reduced from 25 weeks in 2011 to 21 weeks in 2014.  The appeals times are still improving.  The average time taken for an oral hearing last month was down to 26 weeks and the time taken for a summary decision was down to a little under 19 weeks.  By comparison, the time taken for an oral hearing in 2007, before the collapse, was 30.3 weeks and the time take for a summary decision was 14.2 weeks.  Notwithstanding the major increases in the numbers, we have improved on what applied at the height of the Celtic tiger with far fewer people.<\/p><p> I call on the Deputies to consider what would happen if we were to proceed with this proposal.  The timeframe offered in the amendment does not take account of the fact that it is a two-stage process, including an initial review by the Department and consideration of an appeal by an appeals officer, either on a summary basis or by means of an oral hearing.  The proposed amendment would mean that even where the underlying conditions for receipt of social welfare payments were not met, an appeal would be allowed simply on the basis of the elapse of time.  In many cases the elapse of time is to enable people to put in additional material to support their case thus allowing the case to receive additional consideration.  The proposal is simply not tenable and could lead to a misuse of public funds.  In fact, it could lead to a situation whereby it would be in an appellant's interest to delay an appeal beyond the statutory deadline to achieve this result.<\/p><p> I am fully aware of and I share the considerations that have led Deputies to introduce the amendment but in respect of the consequences of the amendment it is a case of being careful what we wish for.  One good point of the Irish system, unlike other systems, is that an applicant can submit an application and then amend, improve and update the application on the basis of circumstances that the person may not have included at the time.  This would not be possible if we moved to a fixed time.  For example, a Deputy may only meet a constituent at a late date, in which case it would be difficult to assist the constituent.  As I said, it is a case of being careful what we wish for.<\/p><p> As a Deputy I have dealt with significant numbers of social welfare appeals and applications and I am experienced in the area.  The motivation is good but the consequences of what the Deputy is suggesting must be considered.  The proposal brings in elements of the British system whereby the times are limited and this does not always work to the benefit of the people applying.  They may have difficulties completing forms and may not put forward the best case.  Our system allows for constant reviews, as the Deputies are aware.  I would not recommend and I do not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600012#L00600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417012500,"counter":127,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600013#M00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1417012500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>There is a certain frustration that the T&aacute;naiste is not hearing the reason why we are putting down these amendments.

A total of five months was wasted for the person in that case.  For five months the file was sitting on someone's desk.  It was not examined for some reason or was put aside or whatever.<\/p><p>  I accept the point made by the Minister to the effect that some cases can be complicated and that when extra information comes on board we need to allow the process to be gone through.  Will the T&aacute;naiste be more forthcoming?  When a person makes an application for any social welfare payment, is the person advised to go to a one-stop shop, whether SOLAS or elsewhere, where someone could explain exactly what the person needs and how to approach it as well as assistance with filling in the form?  This would mean fewer chances of people losing an appeal.  If 56% of people get a decision on appeal then something is wrong somewhere.  An applicant could have had problems at the beginning of the process in accessing the payment.  Perhaps that could be examined.  We should also examine some basic replies.

In the event that they get a cursory letter from the doctor, it is often the consultant that causes the delay.  At present, there are waiting lists of two to three months in most consultants' offices just to get a letter stating what is on their file.  That is a difficulty.

She says the present system is a help to applicants.  Due to the delays they can submit new evidence to strengthen their cases and so forth.  Her point is that the present system assists appellants because, as time passes, if one gets further evidence and so forth one can strengthen one's initial case.  However, if one takes that argument to its logical conclusion, it would be a case for extending the delay period even further and saying that an appeal cannot be decided finally for at least a year or 18 months so that every scrap of information that can be got can be submitted.<\/p><p>  The Minister also said the appeals office is independent.  That is correct.  It has a quasi-judicial role.  It has not yet been put on a statutory basis, but I acknowledge the fact that it is independent.  On the other hand the Minister also points out that the Government was able to do certain things which made the process shorter, so it is not independent in that sense.  The Government has the power to take certain steps which will shorten the waiting time for appeals.  It has already done that, so it can do so again.<\/p><p>  It is correct that it is a multi-stage process.  One of the big causes of delay in getting a result in an appeal is that the file has not yet been sent from the Department to the appeals officer.  I understand that in many cases, particularly with carer's allowance and disability allowance, it is taking an average of four months for the file to go from the Department to the appeals office.  Will the Minister see what can be done to shorten that period?<\/p><p>  We are seeking something specific here.  We are dealing with a situation where the decision is overturned by way of a review or by appeal.  Some decisions will be overturned by way of a review, which is a much shorter process than an appeal, but a number of them will go to appeal.  On the last count, 56% of the decisions were wrong in the first instance.  Consider the case of a person who gets a wrong decision.  They have to wait for the claim to be assessed as it takes time for the initial decision to be made.  Then if they appeal, it could take another five or six months.  In many cases, although not all of them, these people have no alternative source of income while they are waiting, for example, applicants for carer's allowance.  Applicants in cases where habitual residence is an issue will not get a supplementary welfare allowance while they are waiting.<\/p><p>  During that lengthy waiting period not only do they suffer loss of income and all that entails - in many cases they are living on charity - but they also experience a great deal of anxiety and distress because they are waiting for a life-changing decision, whether they are entitled to social welfare.  They suffer great anxiety during that period.  I am seeking to shorten the length of that period, to reduce the time for which they will be poor or totally impecunious, and the time for which they will be distressed, anxious and waiting.  If the resources within the Department do not permit that to be done now, I ask the Minister to commit to doing it as soon as possible by putting further improvements in place, as has been done to shorten the appeal period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600014#N00900","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1417013100,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We all share a common objective here, that where people have an entitlement to a social welfare income support they would be dealt with as quickly, efficiently, effectively and courteously as possible.  It should be stressed again that, in essence, we have a multiple review process and opportunity.  It is not available in the British or Northern Ireland systems.  It is one of the reasons our system is much more flexible and able to meet the needs of people in a timely way.  The investments in information technology, IT, which have been very considerable, have speeded up the system.  As I said, when I was appointed Minister in 2011, the time taken for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks.  At the end of September last, it was down to 29.3 weeks.  Bear in mind that it takes time to set a date and so forth for an oral hearing.  As Deputies know, when people demand an oral hearing it takes more time.  The time required for summary decisions in 2011 was over 25 weeks.  It is now down to 21.8 weeks.<\/p><p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said about the letter that is issued.  I am aware of that and we are having it reviewed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is anxious to review it.  For legal reasons there is a very clear emphasis in the letter advising somebody that their application is unsuccessful on advising them that, legally, they have a right to appeal.  In the Irish system, perhaps when the person goes to somebody such as the Deputies or myself, they find out that in fact the documentation or the case that was made was not sufficiently strong.  It could have been a general letter from a doctor saying, for example, the doctor thinks Mr. and Mrs. X should get a particular benefit.  However, as the Deputies know, the same letter to the housing department in a local authority will not do much for the case.  It is just an expression of a wish from the professional person that the case be viewed favourably, whereas there are precise questions that must be answered.<\/p> <p> What is potentially being suggested is a switch to a system similar to that in the UK system.  The system in Ireland offers those who apply a flexible, speedy and relatively informal approach to the determination of their appeal.  In the UK, by contrast, the social security and child support tribunal - which is the equivalent appeals tribunal - took an average of 30 weeks to clear cases, whereas in our system, the waiting times for an oral hearing was 29 weeks and for the summary decision 21 weeks.  In addition, because the UK system is time-based, the measurement does not reflect the time spent with the Department for Work and Pensions in reviewing the case, which is a mandatory first step before the appeal is lodged.  One gets one chance before the appeal is lodged.  We allow multiple opportunities for reviews.  That is the flexibility of our system.  In addition the UK appeals system is more inflexible in that the tribunal deals only with the decision that was made at a point in time and based on the evidence submitted at that point in time.  Their system is strictly time-based.  I share the sentiments of those who tabled the amendment but I advise them to give it very careful consideration.<\/p><p> I have had discussions with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh on previous occasions that the review possibility should be emphasised more in the appeals communications.  The Department of Social Protection has new offices that have been revamped and I invite members to visit the Intreo offices.  I know both Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and O'Dea have been in the new Intreo offices in their areas on a number of occasions.  The Intreo office has a common reception desk at the front of the office and information and forms are available from a staff who have been highly praised.  These staff are not highly paid but they have been highly praised for being customer friendly and for the manner in which they provide information to people.  Should people need help in filling out the form, they will make an appointment for the person to get guidance and assistance.  Clearly only they know their own case.  In making a case staff have to be aware that it could be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts to see if it comes within the terms of the law.  I hope the person dealing with a strong case will be able to deal with it as quickly and efficiently as possible.<\/p><p> There is a very good Social Welfare office in Ballyfermot and there are other Intreo offices in the constituency.  SOLAS is the body that deals with education, whereas Intreo which comes from the Irish words, \"in agus treo\" , meaning into a new direction to help people to get back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600014#N01000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417013700,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I am not arguing for the introduction of the British system here, I am arguing for a slight change in the Irish system to assist appellants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014112600015#O00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1417013700,"counter":141,"content":"<p>There are practical changes that could possibly be helpful, for instance I have dealt with a number of cases where people applied for an invalidity pension, which has a higher threshold which they would not meet instead of applying for a payment with lower thresholds.

If the officer reviewing the case notices that somebody would have a better chance of success if they applied to a different scheme, my point is that the officer could telephone the client, inviting him or her to discuss the application in the office and could then suggest that the individual might qualify for a different payment with a lower threshold.  This would save the individual going through the appeal system and after a period of six months to year, finding out that he or she was ineligible for that particular payment but could be eligible for a different allowance.

While the Government intends making the amendment to Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as mentioned by Deputy Willie O'Dea, a number of related changes also need to be made at the same time.  For example, the Data Protection Commissioner will oversee the deletion of all PPS data held by Irish Water in the case of those people who have already registered with the company and provided their details.  Therefore, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will shortly bring forward legislation to provide for the various changes announced last week, including the deletion of all PPS data held by Irish Water.  Accordingly, it is considered more appropriate to legislate for all the various measures relating to the discontinuance of the use of PPS numbers by Irish Water in a single piece of legislation.  The amendments to delete the reference to Irish Water from Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will, therefore, be carried in the legislation to be brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.

My colleagues and I wanted to speak about the disgraceful way in which deferred pensioners are being treated in connection with a certain pension scheme at present.  We want to try to ensure a situation where somebody cannot wind up a defined benefit pension scheme unless it is 90% funded.  We want a fair appeals system where trustees have decided to reduce people's benefits.  Given the demography of the country, in 20 or 25 years in relative terms we will not be able to maintain the same State pension benefits as at present, therefore, some alternative must be put in place.<\/p><p>  All the changes that have taken place in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are taking us further away from that.  I do not know anybody who would be disposed to investing in a defined benefit pension scheme as the element of certainty which was the attraction of these schemes has disappeared.  There are practical and necessary things we can do to make the system fair, just and equitable for pensioners to ensure there is no discrimination between deferred pensioners, actual pensioners and people who are still at work and potential pensioners.  I regret we cannot debate these matters.  This Bill appears to me to be the obvious vehicle to table those series of amendments.

It laid out a number of issues.  There have been quite a few significant developments since I last addressed members, too many to summarise fully in a short introductory statement.  As such, I will concentrate on a select few.<\/p> <p>The reduction of two further steps in the European Central Bank's main policy interest rate has had a complicating influence on financing conditions in Ireland.  On balance, the positives for Ireland clearly outweigh the negatives, not least to the extent that the ECB expansionary policy will help boost economic demand in the euro area as a whole in the course of bringing inflation back to the bank's target.  Irish borrowers on tracker mortgages have seen these further interest rate reductions fully passed on to them, continuing and reinforcing an exceptionally lengthy period of ultra-low interest rates that has helped these borrowers.  However, because of the impact on tracker mortgages, the lower ECB rates have not directly improved the banks' profitability, because the average and marginal cost of bank funds has not fallen as much.  The banks' drive to restore their profitability combined with a lack of sufficient new competition has meant that, far from lowering their standard variable rates in the past three years as ECB rates have fallen, they have, as is well known, increased their standard variable rates somewhat.<\/p><p> I have distributed to the committee members figures and data which show a simple bank-by-bank average of the advertised standard variable rates for an 80% loan-to-value mortgage.  I am distributing these numbers because this trend is not evident from the traditional interest rate series as published by the Central Bank in line with international standards.  We have been working on the assembly of additional statistical series on mortgage interest rates on a rigorous basis.  They are relevant to the question of how much it costs someone on a standard variable rate.  We expect to publish these data from January 2015.  The data indicate that the standard variable rates borrowers are paying are still less than they were before the crisis but not by all that much.  A widening of mortgage interest rate spreads over policy rates also occurred in the United Kingdom and in many euro area countries after the crisis but spreads have begun to narrow in the UK and elsewhere.  Until recently, bank competition has been too weak in Ireland to result in any substantial inroads on rates.<\/p><p> What is the role of the Central Bank in the area of mortgage interest rates?  From a prudential point of view, we could have a role in seeking to ensure that banks set rates on new business sufficiently high to cover the risks of future default.  While the current spreads would not have been sufficient to compensate the banks for the risks they actually took during the boom - much of this risk is still embedded in the existing stock of mortgages - it would be hard to argue that mortgage underwriting today is so bad as to require such a high margin on new business.  However, that is not the way standard variable rates work.  They work out more or less the same for new and existing arrangements.  Constrained by their inability to restore spreads on tracker mortgages - they are negative in many cases - the banks have sought all means to restore their profitability, including the widening of standard variable rate spreads.  As I have said, these typically apply to old as well as new business.<\/p><p> As in all advanced economies, in Ireland it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counter-productive in ensuring a sufficient flow of property price credit on a lasting basis.  For one thing, such control would strongly discourage new entrants.  Therefore, while interest rate spreads are now high I need not remind the committee that since national credit policy is crafted with the welfare of the people as a whole as the constant and predominant aim, I see no sufficient basis for altering this view.  Of course, the Central Bank does not have the power to set those rates, but that is a policy view.<\/p><p> There has been much discussion of the Central Bank's consultation paper on macro prudential instruments and the limits proposed on high loan-to-value and loan-to-income mortgages.  The consultation period ends on 8 December and we hope to be able to announce a finalised set of regulations soon after that date, depending on the complexity of the responses received.  It may be asked whether the Central Bank believes that recent property market developments represent a bubble.  That is not specifically the driver of these proposals.  Instead, through these measures we want to have in place a standing regime which ensures that a credit-driven bubble does not take hold and that a new generation does not become over-indebted.  We should consider what would happen in the absence of such a regime.  There have been sharp price rises in Dublin.  According to the figures published today by the Central Statistics Office, they jumped by 42% in only 18 months.  This is a thin market and the rises have not yet elicited a sufficient supply response.  It could sow the seeds of trouble for the future.  Our approach seeks to draw on ongoing research being carried out at the Central Bank along with international experience and any matters which may emerge in the consultation.  We are keen to shorten the period of uncertainty as much as possible.  Accordingly, after making any appropriate refinements, for example, I already mentioned in public in respect of first-time buyers the potential future use of private mortgage insurance - this was floated in the consultation paper - we will move quickly to confirm the parameters of the new standing regime.<\/p><p> Almost all of the discussions in which I have participated at this committee in recent years have, naturally, focused on the banks and, in particular, mortgage arrears related to the banks.  This is only one element of the Central Bank's mandate.  I remind the committee that almost nine out of ten staff of the Central Bank are actually engaged in numerous tasks other than the prudential supervision of banks.  The staff deal with other aspects of banking oversight, such as the consumer protection and conduct of business aspects of bank regulation.  However, micro prudential banking supervisory decision-making is now largely passed to the control of the European Union Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, which came into operation on 4 November.  The SSM does not, however, mean less work for those of us in Dublin, rather it means more work inasmuch as the procedures of the SSM require further expansion of our bank supervisory staff as well as a reorganisation of that function.<\/p><p> After three years during which staffing levels of the Central Bank have not risen, the bank now needs to increase staff numbers again not only because of the SSM, but also because of the additional complexity of new international regulations covering non-bank financial services.  These are at the heart of the IFSC, an area to which we devote many resources to supervising, albeit this is invisible to the public.  There are new rules on bank resolution as well and other new mandates which we have been given.<\/p><p> By the way, much of the cost is recovered from the regulated industry.  The industry pays many of the costs and indeed all regulatory costs could be so recovered, instead of eating into the Central Bank's surplus income, which is to be transferred to the Exchequer.  The Central Bank has suggested this to successive Governments.  I believe it would be a good idea if the industry paid all of the regulatory costs.<\/p><p> Having already absorbed a sizeable increase in staffing during the period 2010-11 when we worked to upscale our operations in response to the crisis, we are currently engaged in an extensive review of our internal organisation to ensure the conditions for steady improvement in the effectiveness of our work.  This work relates to essential matters which, especially when they are proceeding well, are not obviously visible to the public.  The review is examining a range of issues including internal structures, career paths and internal processes.  I expect significant beneficial changes to both organisational structures and practices within the Central Bank as a result of the review.  Our effectiveness will be enhanced by our carefully designed and efficient headquarters building at North Wall Quay, the main building contract for which is now out to tender.  This will result in bringing together all our non-currency staff, that is to say, all bar the Sandyford staff, into a single location.  There are strong financial and practical benefits to the move.<\/p><p> I will not add anything to the lengthy letter on mortgage arrears which I sent to the committee in September providing commentary and responses to the committee's recent report on the mortgage arrears situation.  The situation has continued to evolve in line with the indications in that letter.  The committee's invitation indicated a wide range of potential topics for discussion today.  A wide range of issues come under our remit and I am happy to take any questions and to try to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417010400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome the Governor, Professor Honohan, today.  I thank him for his response to the detailed information sought by the committee and his ongoing co-operation.  I will begin with the issue of standard variable interest rates for mortgage holders, which the Governor dealt with in the early part of his opening statement.  I get the impression from what the Governor said that he believes rates are high.  However, the Central Bank is not willing to intervene in the sense since it does not want to be setting interest rates, which is understandable.  The Governor said it would be counter-productive to exert administrative control.  Does the Governor believe that the variable rates being charged by banks at the moment, which are in the region of 4.5% for new mortgages, are too high?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600003#B00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417010400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>There are certainly on the high side.<\/p> <p>However, we must ask what we mean by \"too high\".  As the committee was told by the banks that presented to it in the past few weeks, they cannot fund themselves at the ECB policy rate.  That is not the way it works, as everyone knows.  The 4.5% should not be compared with 0.05% in terms of the cost of funds.  Approximately 300 basis points or 3% is the spread over the banks' average cost of funds, although less over their marginal cost of funds.  It is a bit on the high side, but not by all that much.  We do not have the power to intervene.<\/p><p> I will jump ahead to the question of whether the Oireachtas should consider giving us that power.  I would suggest not.  In terms of the provision of mortgage credit and the in-flow of banking services into the economy, the confidence around the way banking and the financial system work - I am not referring to national confidence - is not well served by there being tight control over interest rates.  In the 1960s to 1980s when a cartel of bankers was setting interest rates subject to some kind of approval by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, it was a facade because our control did not influence the rates, which were largely coming in from abroad.  It would not be a good idea to introduce a regime of tightly controlled mortgage rates.<\/p><p> However, I would make an exception.  The committee will presumably be considering legislation in the near future about the mortgages that are sold to non-banks, ones that are simply harvesting those mortgages without getting involved in new business.  It may be that there should be some limitation on the degree to which they could deviate from market practice.  What locks the standard variable rate contract into reality is the fact that it should be the rate that is charged by the lender on new and old business, more or less keeping lenders in line with market conditions.  However, if an entity is not making new business, it might not have this natural restraint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417011000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The 300,000 or so standard variable rate customers in the system whose mortgages are with the main banks are paying an interest rate that the Governor regards as high at 4% to 4.5% in the majority of cases when the banks' cost of funds typically lies between 1% and 2%.  The banks are taking advantage of and exploiting those customers.  The banks clearly have a major problem with tracker mortgages, on which they are not making much of a profit, if any.  They seem to be heaping all of the burden on the variable rate customers and extracting the maximum amount of profits from them.<\/p><p>  The Governor is not prepared to seek additional powers to intervene, but has he held discussions with the banks and conveyed to them the views he communicated to us, namely, that the rates are high?

It is taking a long time to get there, as we have many times discussed.  This is largely the reason that they are not functioning progressively as part of a normal banking system.  It is not just the banks themselves but their customers as well.  We all agree that banks should be lending to small businesses, but we must consider who are the owners of those businesses.  In many instances, they are owned by families whose finances are in disarray because of mortgages and other things.  Moving forward involves fixing the backbone.  This is why we have not been able to arrive at a situation where we have three, four or five clean, new banks working holistically.  We have looked at ways of achieving that, but the bottom line is that yesterday's customers are tomorrow's customers.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the medium-term perspective.  My dream for a long time has been for a cross-Europe banking system with banks that have a presence right across Europe.  Unfortunately, that dream does not seem anywhere near being realised.  I can envisage our banks being owned by a large international bank - at one stage, one might have imagined it being the other way around - and in just the same way as we use Microsoft and Google, we would use the services of an international bank.  That type of set-up would have separated all the problems of linkages between the Irish Government's issues with debt and would allow us to be on a level playing field with everybody else.  However, the appetite of international banks for getting involved in peripheral countries or in any cross-border activities has been dampened by their own problems.  The large international banks have been under pressure to raise capital.  We think we are the only country that lost money in the banking crisis, but they lost money too.  None of this is happening but it is where I would like to see us going.  I have no difficulty with Irish-owned banks, but I would like to see a backbone in the Irish system of strong international banks.  What we have had, on the contrary, is major international banks retreating.  Lloyds is gone, for example, but, fortunately, RBS is still here in the form of Ulster Bank.<\/p><p>  All of that is one dimension, but there is another dimension to consider.  I have spoken about this before and a copy of a speech I gave a year ago or so was circulated to the committee as a background document.  There should be a second tier of banking which is geared more towards local concerns, with local managers and a greater level of local awareness.  This would be on a scale larger than the credit unions.  They could be the nucleus of it, but the credit unions as they stand are too small individually to be really effective suppliers of services.  This is all a long-term vision.  The entry of large international banks into the Irish system does not seem to be coming down the tracks, although these things can change.  I am sure that when they start to invest in peripheral countries again, Ireland will be among the first they look to because they are impressed by the ability of the Irish economy to adjust and react.  They will be impressed that the Irish people, despite all the pressures, have recognised that we all must pull our weight.  That is what they have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600006#E01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417012200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>What Professor Honohan is saying is interesting.

The Government has now announced its plan.

The mortgage guarantee will not be in place for January.  I know that we are in consultation mode, but people are panicked and do not know what is happening.

It is always nice to engage with him.  I wish to follow up on his macro prudential policy for the residential real estate sector and the various issues he raised in that document.  I realise it is a consultation process and that we are part of that process.  One of my concerns is the impact, which was alluded to in one of the national newspapers today.  There has been much concern since this was announced and today, in a leaked report, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, expressed its concerns about the numbers that would be unable to access home ownership in Ireland in the future.  I wish to explore the interface between banking policy and public policy.  There are reasons Governments wish to encourage home ownership, not least some of the research that shows that people in older age suffer less poverty because they own their homes, for example, and that home ownership is a very good means of redistributing wealth in society.  People who do not have their own homes will never save that amount of money by investing, for the sake of argument, in stocks and shares or whatever else.  There is much international research and many reasons Governments want people to own homes; therefore, it is a concern if a large number of people are excluded from the home ownership market.<\/p><p>  I wish to explore some of Professor Honohan's methodology in what he has proposed.  Are we dealing with prudent or exclusionary lending?  Professor Honohan's paper raises the issue of boom and bust cycles.  A question I raised with all of the banks' representatives who have appeared before the committee in the past few weeks was whether they thought we were either heading into or were in a property boom.  The answer universally was \"No\", that when one took into account the rises and falls in the market, we were still 40% below where we were at the height of the market.  This is for Professor Honohan's information in case he has not seen the reports from the committee.  A number of the banks' representatives also said they would make submissions and that they were not in agreement with Professor Honohan's policy.<\/p><p>  To move on to the methodological issues in what is being proposed, it appears to be a case of one size fits all.  In other words, three and a half times a very large income is very different from three and a half times a very low income.  I have concerns that what Professor Honohan is proposing is not sufficiently nuanced to the reality of people's lives.<\/p><p>  The second point made by Professor Honohan refers to boom and bust, with rising and falling prices.  Let us say my income is &euro;80,000 per annum and house prices fall to, for example, &euro;120,000 for the average home.  I can see how the system works when prices are rising, but I do not see how it works when prices have fallen.  Professor Honohan mentioned the European Systemic Risk Board as the framework he consulted, but when I looked at the rest of his research - he was looking at the Irish system - he only went back as far as 1998.  He has not explored the Irish lending market pre-1998.  Historically, Irish people do not default on mortgages and have no particular history of doing so, yet there has been a very high level of home ownership.  Has Professor Honohan looked at the historical local authority mortgage market to examine the levels of default of people who have been on very low incomes?  I am very concerned that we are closing doors based on an historical earthquake, as it were, at a particular time, rather than the norm in the Irish housing market since widespread lending began from approximately 1972.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600007#F00600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417013400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>We are not attempting social engineering or to change society into one in which there will be less home ownership.

In 2011, we started our mortgage arrears resolution system.  The Central Bank started to press the banks to get to grips with their systems which were not really fit for purpose.  After the legislation changing the Dunne judgment, the change in our code of conduct on mortgage arrears, our targets regime and our definitions of sustainability, it would not be fair to say the banks' systems are not fit for purpose.  They may not be best in class but they are fit for purpose.  Their policies are more coherent.  They may not be exactly aligned with my views but one could not quarrel with them.  Importantly, they have delivered on the targets.<\/p><p>  Some 90% or so of the arrears cases are in a proposed state and 40% to 50% of the arrears cases are in a concluded state which, in many cases, involves court cases.  We are not happy with the percentages going into the court process.  We hope more will reach a situation where the indebted person and the bank talk to each other, exchange information and a viable restructure is concluded and that it does not go to a repossession of the property when that does not happen.  It is the right solution in some cases but the percentage going to court is too high.  We have said a million times that banks should work harder but borrowers should not be afraid to open the letters, get advice from MABS and engage because a better solution is available.  <\/p><p>  In regard to the cases which have been through this process since 2013, some 88% to 89% are meeting the terms of the restructure, which is much better than the earlier wave in 2011 and 2012, which we published recently.  The percentage then was much lower.  People were falling back into arrears again.  It is early days and I am not saying the 88% will continue and that five years time, it will still be 88%.  It will not be and some of them will fall by the wayside and will not be able to meet it.  That is why I would be inclined to encourage the banks to be more liberal in their restructures so that fewer of them come back to the table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600010#J00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417014600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>When Permanent TSB appeared before us, I think it said that when the whole process is being worked out and, for some reason or other, the house is given up voluntarily or is repossessed, it has a system where it writes off up to 80% of the residual debt.

It was interesting to hear him state that houses might still be overvalued.  In 1991, a three bedroom house could be purchased for &euro;38,000.  The cost of that house then ballooned to &euro;280,000 before subsequently dropping again.  One is obliged to wonder what is the real value of such a property.  When discussing affordable housing, we must not lose sight of the importance of amenities, etc.  One of the mistakes made in the past was that housing was constructed but no amenities were put in place.  There is a two-tier system in place at present.  Dublin has many issues when it comes to housing but the dynamic in respect of the remainder of the country does not reflect this at all.  I am in the unenviable position of being a landlord.  In the past it was possible to charge &euro;1,000 rent for an apartment in Cork.  The figure dropped to &euro;750 but has risen again, although only to &euro;890 or &euro;900.  Rents have not returned to previous levels at all because demand is only okay - it is not accelerating.<\/p><p>  I put it to Professor Honohan that many investors who bought into the rental market when it was at its height now want out.  They cannot get out, however, because if they sell, they will immediately crystallise their negative equity.  Many of these people became involved in the sector because their businesses were successful and they used their disposable income to invest.  Apartments in Cork which previously would have cost &euro;320,000 are selling now for &euro;130,000.  That is a massive reduction.  In nearby counties, houses which previously would have sold for &euro;200,000 now cost &euro;100,000.  The people who bought properties are making a loss of &euro;7,000 on them each year.  That is going to be the case for the next 15 years at least until these properties are washed out of the system.  I have heard all the arguments put forward and I agree with some of them.  Creating employment in rural areas would certainly help because people would be brought to places in which there is existing and affordable housing.  However, using a one-size-fits-all solution for Dublin and the remainder of the country is not the way to go.  People must recognise that two different dynamics are at play.<\/p><p>  Legacy debt remains an issue.  Many SMEs that would have become involved in the area of property remain saddled with their investments.  I commend the banks because they have the expertise to deal with this matter and they have finally begun to examine it.  Previously, they had stood apart from any involvement.  Many businesses are under pressure as a result of bad investments and they have difficulties with regard to arrears.  The split-mortgage proposal put forward in the Keane report could have been pursued more vigorously in the context of the SME sector in order to resolve the problem of overhanging debt.  I am aware of people who obtained 20-year mortgages in dubious circumstances.  Expecting these individuals to remain healthy and wealthy up to the age of 70 was always going to be a big ask.  Interest rates remaining low has been a saving grace.  When we obtained our mortgage in 1997, the rate which applied was 7.7% and we were delighted with that.  I have heard people criticising mortgage interest rates of 4%.  If one cannot afford to pay that rate of interest, then one should not be getting a mortgage.  In historical terms, 4% is a low interest rate.  However, Professor Honohan may disagree.  As already stated, the pillar banks have come a long way in terms of dealing with this matter.<\/p><p>  Is Professor Honohan of the opinion that there is a need to establish a commercial bank - in the past we had the ICI - to deal with SMEs?  Such a bank would have the expertise to assist SMEs with their legacy debt and their links to the property market and could provide them with finance into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600011#K02700","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417015200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a number of points.  On the geographical split, it is true that the Dublin area has experienced a big upturn in prices.  There has also been an upturn in some of the other larger urban areas but to a much more limited extent.  As far as our information is concerned, the number of high loan-to-value and loan-to-income mortgages outside the Dublin area is extremely small.  People might ask why we are not just introducing what is proposed in respect of the Dublin area.  Actually, it seems as if it will have little to no effect outside Dublin.  This is presumably because property prices are lower and because the people who want to buy will be able to raise the higher percentage required in terms of their deposits and so forth.<\/p><p>  I do not know that I can give much comfort in respect of the prospect of prices returning to where they were at the peak.  The peak is the unusual aspect.  In the context of where we are now, we have no evidence that prices are out of line.  In other words, that they are either too high or too low.  Nobody has a very precise indication in that regard.  Previously, we would have had an indication.  During the boom, for example, we would have stated \"It is too high but we are not sure by how much\".  Now it is in the range where people say \"It might be all right\".  I am not sure I can provide the Deputy with much comfort in respect of that matter.<\/p><p>  I am in favour of new banks entering the market, as long as they are well run by proper people.<\/p> <p> With regard to the question of the State starting a new bank, I hardly need to remind the Senator that the State owns two substantial banks at present.  It is hard enough to fix the current problems.  The problems, as the Senator said so rightly, are entangled with legacy business.  A businessman coming to a new bank saying he would like a loan will first be asked what his current business is, and then he will be asked who he borrowed from before, thus bringing one back to the whole settlement.  The banks are dealing with SME loans to some extent with split mortgage-type arrangements, similar to the half debt concept.  Much of banks' processing of SME cases is in this category.  They try to separate the property-related debt, which they regard as a separate loan, from the ongoing business debts.  The Senator is correct in saying that is an important part of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600011#K02800","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417015800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Honohan for attending.

High house prices really only benefit banks in the long run.  It is also the role of the Government to ensure prices are steady in the long run so people can plan for the future.  It seems we are now entering a period in which the opposite of those two points is the case.  House prices are unsteady again and in some places they are rising incredibly quickly.<\/p><p>  The Governor mentioned that there is no credit bubble in the property market currently.  There is not but there is a bubble in the price, and that is coming from the supply side problems in the main.<\/p> <p>The banking industry plays a big role in that supply side with regard to credit.  What can be done to ensure that credit goes to the individuals seeking to supply extra units in the areas of greatest demand to ensure that the objectives of the housing market are met?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600012#L02200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417016400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The banks are being far more cautious than they were in the past.

The Central Bank will not instruct or encourage banks to take on that risk.  That is a risk that should be taken by providers.  It is an equity risk.  Banks should be lending for things they can be relatively sure they will get back.  There is lot of equity finance coming into Ireland from abroad.  Deputy Boyd Barrett already mentioned the investors buying up blocks of flats and so on.  It is possible that this channel could be used.  I think builders do not want to take that higher cost because they would like to see all of their funding sourced at the low interest rates that are available from banks.  I cannot see that the banks should be pushed or encouraged into taking those kinds of risks with builders and developers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417016400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Sometimes we have a pro-cyclical experience whereby, straight after a crash, there is a movement towards a drying-up of credit, etc.  It makes the cycle deeper and worsens it.

I have gone down a long way down the road in about five cases <i>pro bono<\/i>, where I really rolled up my sleeves, and I can truthfully say with hand on heart that the banks are operationally out of control.  The point Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made is absolutely valid.  There are different people all over the place and there is no coherence.  There is also a reluctance and an objection to meeting with people at a senior level in the banks, and that is not on.  It is just not on when the Government owns almost 15% of Bank of Ireland and most of AIB.  It is not acceptable.  As Professor Honohan rightly says, families are distressed.  Roughly speaking, there are about 100,000 families in mortgage distress at the moment.  That equates to 350,000 human souls, on average - four times the capacity of Croke Park.  That is not acceptable in a civilised society.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, had the horrible experience of being trapped in a car for two hours.  Three hundred and fifty thousand people are trapped in their homes for the foreseeable future - for the rest of their lives - and that is just wrong.  We will park that for a moment.<br\/>In respect of property values, even in Dublin, it is not right that the newspaper headlines scream &quot;23% uplift in the last year&quot;.  It is irresponsible reporting.  Why?  It is because the volume of those transactions that report sale prices is only perhaps at one third the normalised level of transactions in a city of 1.25 million people with the demographics we have?  That is wrong, but it is comfortable for the banks to hold that idea in people's minds.  Why?  It is because they can then manage the provisions they have on their loan books and not write off loans they should be writing off through split mortgages, which involves putting part of the loan on an annuity basis within the lives of the borrowers and parking the rest.  This is clocking up capitalised interest to be pounced upon at some day in the future with this false notion that property values in Dublin have risen by 23%.  It is wrong.  I hope Professor Honohan agrees with me, because these are questions and statements in one.  The value of a modest three- or four-bedroom suburban house in Dublin that may be rented on a normalised basis for &euro;2,000 per month is about &euro;360,000, no matter what any clipboard estate agent tells one.  This is because &euro;2,000 per month is &euro;24,000, and if one multiplies that by 15, which equates to a 7% residential property gross yield, one gets &euro;360,000.<\/p> <p>We know houses are changing hands at &euro;500,000 in that category and, therefore, they are economically overvalued from the point of view of sustainability.  Why are prices rising?  There are a few factors involved.  There is the amount of savings on which a return on deposit cannot be got because there is nil interest, so investors chase the few houses that are on the market.  If we add to that the arrival of American equity funds - we are told by Frank Daly and Brendan McDonagh that 98% of NAMA sales are to originally dollar-based funds that buy euro to buy the investments - the issue is compounded.  There are all sorts of foggy and shadowy movements taking place that are not being explained by the people who could explain them in Ann-and-Barry terms for the benefit of the million and a half people whose lives have been ripped apart by the credit pyramid Ponzi scheme that was built up between 2001 and 2008, when the domestic banking economy grew from three times to five and a half times our national income.  The banks are measurably culpable for that pyramid Ponzi scheme.  How dare they insist, through law, on the collection of all the loans they advanced, with the reckless funding models they had, to create that asset price bubble.  That is wrong.

I have been told by developers that they were told by banks five years ago that the banks had had a bad experience with them and that they would not extend any money to them.  The point I am making is that it takes 12 to 18 months to prepare a site and get houses up, and if the builders that are left standing are in deep trouble and cannot carry that, we will not be able to deal with the supply side issue with the kind of despatch that is needed.  Every third morning we will have people concerned on the community side - charities and all the rest - adducing very sad cases.  Those people do tremendous work but they are definitely in danger of being canonised by the media before they pass away, while the Government is pretty helpless in terms of addressing the supply-side issue.  In terms of solutions with regard to raising the rent supplement, most economists would say that if we raise the rent supplement, within three months rents will have caught up with it again.

Deputy Matthews talked about a 6% or 7% return on property.  There are many people in the United States and elsewhere in world who are looking for 6% to 7% in private initiatives - I do not know whether NAMA can be a broker in some of this as well - to channel some of that money, and it would not take all that much to fill the equity gaps for builders.

I know a number of Departments are working on them, but one would have expected that after six years there would be people ready to go - planners ready to say \"Here is the area in which we need accommodation and these are the requirements, and while they are sufficient, they are not as lavish as they were in the past.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600014#N01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for permitting me to contribute.  I followed Professor Honohan's contribution on the monitor.<\/p><p>  To take up Deputy Rabbitte's last point, I made a note on foot of it to the effect that this is an easy touch for tax revenue.  There has been a sense of hypocrisy at the core of all Government policy on housing in recent years.  I refer to the non-essential costs associated with housing.  Only last week a young girl in my area who got planning approval for a house had to pay a levy of &euro;10,000 before she borrowed any money to build the house and provide the infrastructure.  The Central Bank may have a role to play in trying to drive home some common sense to policy makers.  We talk about access to water being a human right, but one of the basic human rights is housing, and we make it very difficult for people to purchase a house.  I know developers are not the flavour of the month, but when I heard it mentioned earlier that we do not know what house prices are, I telephoned a builder and he made the point that if he spends &euro;100 on blocks and cement and spends ten hours putting them up, he must at least get &euro;200 for building the wall; he cannot build it any more cheaply.  Those are aspects we need to examine.<\/p><p>  The other issue I want to raise is the reporting of house prices.  I read in a local newspaper recently that house prices in Galway, given out by a reputable company, showed a dramatic increase.<\/p> <p>However, they showed a dramatic increase.  While I stand to be corrected on the exact detail, apparently on analysis there was a house valued at &euro;1.3 million in Athenry.  Although this clearly was an incorrect figure, it drove the percentage through the roof, as only ten or 15 houses had been sold during the period.  Such percentages send panic through people.  I can remember appearing on \"Questions and Answers\" in January 2008 or January 2009 with a representative of the Construction Industry Federation in a broadcast on which the auctioneers' association was well represented in the audience.  They talked up the housing industry, but it was a complete sham.  There must be some way of monitoring the position in order that people know the truth.<\/p><p> I have almost concluded, but the Governor mentioned infrastructure.  One of the unintended consequences of the establishment of Irish Water is that it will now, in effect, be able to decide where new development will take place because it will be able to decide what land will be serviced as it will actually hold the purse strings.  Does the Governor see potential dangers in this?  <\/p><p> On a highly relevant issue, the Governor might recall a few members of the Reform Alliance and I sent a document to the Central Bank based on fair value lending.  The document showed the historical correlation between the average house price and the average income.  We had sought a lot of inputs into it for a number of months beforehand and considered it to be a good document.  We remain of that view and while it might seem like heresy to some, its purpose simply is to stop irresponsible lending for which ultimately and historically the taxpayer has been obliged to pick up the tab.  I seek the Governor's views because we consider it to be a better way than seeking a 20% deposit as it pertains to the actual amount of money being lent.  I have always maintained Ireland did not have a property bubble; rather, it had a lending bubble that caused the difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112600014#N01300","speaker":"1184","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417017600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>That is the part that can be under the control of the Central Bank.

This is an important discussion.  I will start from the position that we are all aware of the current process for appointing judges in Ireland.  I want to outline one or two problems and mention some potential solutions.<br\/>The first problem is that appointments are seen to be political.  Judges have admitted that the appointments process is political and the problem is that the current system does nothing to prevent it.  It is something which needs to be examined.  <br\/>Another issue is diversity.  Gender balance has improved in recent years, but we have some way to go to ensure that there is appropriate balance on the benches in terms of gender, background and ethnicity.  Last week I collected data on the number of judges.  There is an obvious improvement in terms of gender.  Of the total number of sitting judges, 30% are female.  The female representation on the Supreme Court is 30%, the Court of Appeal is 22%, the High Court is 22%, the Circuit Court is much better at 42% and it is 30% in the District Court.  It is clear that significant progress has been made here in the attempt to secure an appropriate gender balance, but that is because of the clear aim of the current Government to appoint women to these positions.  However, the percentage of women is still too low and we should not be content with a figure of 30%.  The point is that the current process does nothing to ensure that this trend will continue, it is entirely at the whim of the Government.  It is another issue which needs to be examined.  <br\/>There are also issues with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It has no role if the post in question is the presidency of any court or if the vacancy is being filled by the promotion of a lower court.  While the board is clearly intended to be an advisory body, in reality it is nothing more than a filtering mechanism or a short-listing body.  All it does in reality is remove undesirable or unqualified candidates and the rest of the names are presented to the Government.  There is nothing advisory about the process.  The criteria for appointment as a judge need to be refined and reformed.  <br\/>One very obvious recommendation is to reduce the list of names the board can recommend to the Government.  Almost all of the submissions sent to the Department of Justice and Equality in January had in common the recommendation that a list of three names would go a long way towards eliminating the possibility of appointments being political, and would also give the board a more advisory role and would remove the appearance of it being simply a short-listing body.  This sort of amendment would be compatible with the Constitution as the final choice is still left to the Government.<br\/>Another very simple solution is to allow the board to interview candidates.  It already has the power to do this under section 14(<i>e<\/i>) of the 1995 Act, but it has never availed of the possibility of doing so.  There is no obvious reason why candidates should not be interviewed, as long as the process is fair.  It is something which is done in many other jurisdictions.  In England and Wales, for example, candidates may be required to take part in panel interviews, an interview and a role play, an interview and a presentation or an interview and situational questioning.  It is a much more rigorous process and ensures that candidates can be assessed as to their suitability in a very practical way.<br\/>Another suggested reform is to rank the candidates.  As long as the Government retains discretion not to accept the ranking of the board, this is also compatible with the Constitution.  The membership of the board needs to be examined.  There is currently an overwhelming majority of lawyers on the board.  Increasing the lay members of the committee would help to ensure that issues such as diversity are considered and would also help to avoid the appearance of self-perpetuation by the Judiciary.  Other jurisdictions have done this in a number of ways.  Ontario, for example, provided for a majority of lay members on its committee.  Scotland has equal legal and lay representation.  In England and Wales the chair of the commission is a lay person.  Perhaps one of those options should be considered.  <br\/>The eligibility criteria are very problematic.  The committee members have the wording of section 16(7) before them.  The words &quot;character&quot;, &quot;temperament&quot; and &quot;otherwise suitable&quot; are unacceptably vague and need to be refined.  Other jurisdictions have provided for more precise guidelines.  Scotland is one good example and has very detailed criteria to match each of the judicial offices.  It generally uses 17 precise criteria against which to measure candidates.  In England and Wales candidates are assessed based on merit, but that is broken into six core qualities which are further broken down.  A comprehensive set of eligibility criteria against which to measure candidates, such as the English or Scottish process, would facilitate the short-listing process and help to ensure that the most suitable candidates are put forward to the Government.<br\/>Another issue in regard to eligibility is the question of appointing academics, and perhaps that is something we could discuss.  There needs to be more of a focus on diversity.  Ireland is one of the few jurisdictions which has not focused on this issue.  In many ways, the diversity of the bench is dependent on diversity in the legal profession generally, but there are still actions which could be taken.  One very simple step would be to give feedback to unsuccessful candidates in order that somebody from a minority group who is an unsuccessful candidate will understand that the choice has been made on objective criteria and will be encouraged to apply again.<br\/>We could follow in the steps of Scotland and draw up a diversity strategy.  The Scottish strategy involves monitoring the diversity profile of applicants, holding information sessions, working with the legal profession and promoting judicial office among those who are currently not coming forward.  Other jurisdictions require their boards to have regard to diversity and in Ontario, England and Wales that is put on a legislative basis.  While England and Wales lag behind us in terms of their diversity, they have introduced many recent initiatives in order to tackle their low levels of female and minority representation.  They recently established a judicial task force to implement the 53 recommendations of the Neuberger report published in 2010.  It will work with the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Judicial Appointments Commission in order to remove barriers and promote diversity.<br\/>We need to acknowledge that diversity should involve more than gender and ethnicity.  Rather, it should be concerned with providing a true representation of the population, and not just one section of Ireland.  Diversity is directly related to how the public perceives the Judiciary.  That is related to public confidence in the administration of justice.  There is no quick fix, but perhaps we could consider some of the reforms I mentioned.  At the very least, we need to recognise that a diverse Judiciary is a worthwhile goal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1416994200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cahillane.

It may be useful to set out my background in research on judicial appointments in Ireland and judicial selection systems generally in order that it might form the basis for further questions or discussions.  I have been researching judicial appointments in Ireland for over ten years.  In 2004, I conducted a study of the senior Judiciary in Ireland, a study which updated comparable work from 1969 on Irish judges and their backgrounds.  In the context of this study I asked each participant from the Judiciary why they thought they were appointed and to outline their personal experience of the judicial selection process.<br\/>My follow-up research came to the topic from the other side and focused on the people making the decisions about whom to select for an individual judicial vacancy, in particular the key people in government between 1982 and 2007 and those on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board from 1995 to 2007.  I examined the internal Cabinet processes as well as who did what, who gathered names to consider and how and why decisions were made in respect of appointments.  That period of analysis is useful because it allows us to test the impact of the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board in the context of the 12 year period before it was established and in the 12 years afterwards in terms of its impact on the processes of Government.<br\/>Having created an independent statutory board to make recommendations, how did the board interact with the Government and its decision-making?  Did the change really reduce the scope of Government, if it was so minded, to act politically?  Another useful aspect of that research was that it gave me greater insight into the <i>realpolitik<\/i>of the judicial selection processes in Ireland and the actual operation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, something that has not been well documented over time.<br\/>The research was situated in a comparative analysis of other common law judicial selection systems, including those in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, England and Wales, Israel, the United States, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  It focused on senior judicial appointments, that is to say, the type of judges that can override governments, and in countries where, like Ireland, the appointments are made from practice as opposed to a career judiciary typical of the civil law system.<br\/>In examining these systems, I concentrated on the role of government in respect of judicial appointments and the nature of its power in that system.  To what extent did government have discretion to appoint a preferred candidate?  I also examined the circumstances in which political debate about whether to change to the judicial selection process arose.  It came up from time to time in each jurisdiction, but for different reasons and with different sponsors and outcomes.  The charge generally is that judicial appointments are too political &ndash; the inference being that governments make selection decisions based on political party patronage and that this is necessarily bad.  Such charges are rarely specific or contextualised.  For example, they do not take account of a government acting politically in appointing only women or only people or predominately people from an ethic or religious minority.  It assumes that to act politically is associated with political party patronage, which may or may not be the case.<br\/>The reality of judicial appointments in Ireland is far more complex.  The evidence from 1982 to 2007 suggests the matter is far more complex than making a simple statement that all appointments are political.  It varies between courts from the District Court to the Supreme Court.  A far more important factor in judicial selection from my research of governments and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is the person being known personally or by reputation to the decision-makers of the day.  That is far more important than party political patronage although the two are not mutually exclusive.<br\/>Connected to the charge that a political judicial appointments process is bad is the charge that it presents a threat to judicial independence.  Based on my research I believe there is no real connection between judicial appointment processes and judicial independence in established common law democracies where judges are appointed for a fixed term and need not seek re-election or reconfirmation in any way.  Even prior to 1995, when the Government established the independent board to make recommendations, Ireland enjoyed a reputation of having an exceptionally strong and independent Judiciary throughout the six decades of its existence to that point.  Furthermore, the World Economic Forum global competitiveness report ranked New Zealand as having the most independent judiciary globally.  New Zealand has a judicial selection process that is entirely within the control of politicians.  Ireland came further down the ranking in third place and England and Wales, where the selection process has almost no role for politicians, came sixth.  Therefore, there is no direct relationship between the independence of the judicial institutions, the independence of individual members and the process by which they were appointed.<br\/>I have no wish to go over time.  In conclusion I will suggest some points that may be helpful for the committee.  We should consider the actual operation of the current statutory framework, the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, which is operated and reviewed under the watch of this committee, how the relevant statutory powers have been interpreted over time and how the Act has been implemented by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I can give the committee evidence from my interviews if it is helpful.  The committee may be interested in the findings of my research on the role of politics in judicial appointments between 1982 and 2007 from the perspective of Government.  It may be helpful to comment on some of the recent debate about reform of the Irish judicial selection process, including the recommendations made by GRECO last week as well as earlier recommendations in January from the judicial appointments review committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416994200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

It is an honour to be invited before the committee.  The current system of judicial appointments in Ireland has little to commend it.  While the members of our Judiciary are well-regarded internationally for their quality and are obviously of a high calibre, it is clear, in the words of a recent report by senior members of our Judiciary, that this is in spite of rather than because of our system of judicial appointments.<\/p><p>  There are numerous faults in our current system many of which have been noted by Dr. Cahillane and Dr. Carroll MacNeill.  They include the charge that criteria in considering and evaluating candidates are rather vague in the extreme; that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is composed mainly of judges, with only a small number of lay members, and has taken a hands-off approach to assessing candidates; that the board must, by law, recommend too many candidates but may not rank them; and that the Government can, if it so wishes, choose from those recommendations the candidates who have earned its political favour.  All of these problems merit consideration as we try to balance the need for political involvement in the appointments process with the need to end political patronage.  In this regard we could consider some simple departures such as hearings in this committee for potential judicial nominees.  However, I intend to focus on the issue of judicial diversity and on an aspect of this issue that seems to receive little attention but which is none the less an important consideration in reforming the judicial appointments process.<\/p><p>  The diversity of our Judiciary matters, not only because of perception but because a diverse judiciary would be more reflective of the range of viewpoints and outlooks in our society and would engage in a more rounded judicial discourse.  At present, we have a clear lack of diversity.  It is deeply unfortunate that at present, less than 25% of our superior court judges are women.  There is also little to suggest that this will change any time soon.  At present, only approximately 30% of those called to the Inner Bar, the senior counsel, from where most of our superior court judges are appointed, are women.  We could also make a good case to the effect that there is a lack of diversity in terms of social, educational and economic background among our judges.  The fact that most are selected from the extraordinarily elite pool of successful barristers and the rest from the equally elite pool of successful solicitors makes it hard to argue that our Judiciary is broadly representative of society as a whole.  Our senior judges, while acknowledging that diversity would be desirable if it came about, have suggested that this is irrelevant to the process of judging and that we should focus only on the merit of candidates in considering appointments.  I maintain these are not separate metrics and that there is merit in diversity.<\/p><p>  Another aspect of diversity which gets even less attention than gender is diversity of professional experience.  Currently, we consider only one type of candidate for judicial office: professional lawyers, that is to say, solicitors and barristers with extensive experience in the practice of litigation.  I believe we should consider other candidates and widen the pool from which we select judges.  Deputy Alan Shatter, when Minister for Justice and Equality, suggested some broadening of the range of eligible candidates might be appropriate and I fully agree.<\/p><p>  Under our current rules a candidate is only eligible for appointment to the courts if he has been a practising solicitor or barrister for a certain period, 12 years in the case of the superior courts.  Our senior judges have suggested that we should require even more litigation experience to be appointed as a judge.  This is illustrative of the highly professionalised attitude to judging that prevails in Ireland.  There are two problems with this approach.  First, being a good litigator and being a good judge are not the same thing.  The fact that our current judges are drawn from this group of litigators does not mean candidates drawn from other professional backgrounds would not be equally good.  Second, this view of judging as an adjunct of the legal profession assesses what makes a good judge from the point of view of the litigator rather than from the point of view of society at large.  Although litigators learn valuable skills about practice and procedure, focusing on these aspects of judging ignores the idea that there might be value in a diversity of views and experiences beyond the highest echelons of legal practice.  Judging is not only an exercise in technical legal skill and mechanical application of the legal rules, it is an exercise that draws on personal background, life experience, and one's vision of and viewpoint on the law.<\/p> <p>The practice of litigation, from where almost all of our judges are drawn, entrenches a very particular way of looking at the law but there are many other perspectives.  As one American commentator put it, &quot;Someone with a background in corporate law may feel one way about social issues, while someone who has been an advocate for women&rsquo;s rights may feel a different way&quot;.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The law looks different depending on one's professional background, but as of now we do not value any diversity of professional experience among our judges.<\/font><br\/>Appointing experts from different fields who have legal training, education and experience but have not been involved directly in the conduct of litigation might bring some diversity of views as to how judging should be done.  This is not totally unprecedented.  One recent appointee, Mr. Justice Max Barrett, was not a litigation practitioner before his appointment, though he was a qualified solicitor for the requisite period.  It would seem that similar appointments could be made from the ranks of non-governmental organisations, public interest law groups, law centres, etc.  <br\/>The legal experience of such candidates would be markedly different from most of our current judges.  This could expand the diversity of values and backgrounds in the Irish courts, and bring new perspectives to the Bench.  If we were to relax the practice requirements more substantially, we could consider other candidates.  Senior administrators who have quasi-adjudicative experience from their previous role, and who have specific legal expertise, might bring interesting viewpoints from outside the world of litigation practice.  The former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, had mused on the idea of academics becoming judges, as has been common in the United States and elsewhere. Lest I seem self interested I can assure the members that I do not have any judicial aspirations, but I believe that proposal merits consideration.<br\/>If there is a concern that such candidates might lack knowledge of the specifics of handling litigation in courts, that is something we could give them.  Judicial training would surely benefit all our appointees because arguing a case as a lawyer is not the same as judging one. Courses in judicial studies would be worthwhile for anyone seeking high judicial office.  Diversity in terms of life experience and professional experience would make our Judiciary more representative and broaden the somewhat narrow range of viewpoints considered in our current judicial discourse.  There is merit in diversity and as we consider reform of the appointments process, this vital issue should not be ignored.  <br\/>I again thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the topic of judicial appointments, and would welcome questions on any aspect of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416994800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kenny.

As time has gone on, however, the role of the judicial council seems to be expanded, not necessarily by political circles, to one which will act as a representative body for the Judiciary, and now one which potentially may have a role in respect of judicial selection.  That is very far from what was originally envisaged, and I would exercise great caution about expanding the role of such a body in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600004#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill"},{"type":"speech","time":1416994800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>That comes down to the point that the removal of a judge from office in Ireland through impeachment is virtually impossible, as I well know.

That is something that should be borne in mind.<\/p><p>  On the ratio of women in the Judiciary, I am a solicitor by profession and I am aware there are now more women than men who are qualified solicitors.  As far as I know only one solicitor has ever been appointed to the High Court.  In terms of the Circuit Court, the High Court and particularly the Supreme Court, unless one comes from the Bar Council one's chances of being appointed are slim to nil.  There are some excellent solicitors with a great deal of experience who are being ignored for appointment, and that is not necessarily for political reasons.<\/p><p>  What are the views of the witnesses on continuing legal education programmes for judges?  Family law was not even on the agenda when I studied law, nor was European law.  Family law then became a major issue but I had no experience of dealing with family law courts, etc.  In the area of continuing legal education, which we must all go through, do the witnesses envisage a programme where judges would have to stand aside from the Bench and go through a two or three weeks or a two or three months training course every three or five years to be updated on that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600004#C00800","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416994800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The point about solicitors is a very good one.  There has been some movement in that there have been more appointments from the ranks of solicitors recently.  A statistic the Law Society put out recently indicated that 8% of appointments to the superior courts in the past 12 years were from the ranks of solicitors, which is still a very small number.  That should increase.  It was noted in the most recent batch of High Court appointments that solicitors outnumbered barristers in terms of superior court appointments, and that was the first batch where that had ever happened.  There might be a movement in that direction.<\/p><p>  In terms of the number of lawyers in the country, approximately 80% would be qualified solicitors as opposed to approximately 20% who would be practising barristers.  There has been a significant tilt towards the barristers' profession in that, and it is only since the mid-1990s that solicitors could be appointed to those courts.  That is something that should change.  It is perhaps true that solicitors have broader ranges of experience in the law and can engage in different functions while barristers tend to have more specific expertise in litigation.  It is certainly something that is worthwhile and that should be a goal in the medium term.<\/p><p>  As to continuing judicial education, there is nothing to be said against it.  It is essential.  It has been talked about a great deal but very little progress has been made on it.  All applications to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board guarantee to undertake whatever training is required and repeatedly our judges have called for well-resourced systems of judicial education for all judges.  That still has not been pushed, but it is essential.  Courses in judicial studies should be required both at the start of and throughout a judicial career because there is nothing to be said against it.

I wrote a paper on this in 2007, which I will provide to the Senator, and one of the problems with this is the interpretation of the 2002 amendment Act which states that the solicitors, or anyone, applying should have appropriate knowledge and experience of superior court practice and procedure, but it does not define that.

Over 50% of law students have been women since the mid-1980s.  Dr. Kenny made reference to the Inner Bar - senior counsel - and this seems to be a particularly difficult area for women to break into.

However, there is a lot of research demonstrating that merit and diversity are actually compatible.  We do not have to have one as opposed to the other.  The issue of increasing diversity of minority groups - not just of gender - must, in my view, be taken into consideration by a Judicial Appointments Commission.

How does Dr. Carroll MacNeill think this could be changed short of legislative amendment, or is legislative amendment required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600005#D00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416995400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>It is a very important point.  The legislation gives the JAAB the capacity to recommend at least seven names in respect of each vacancy.  &quot;At least seven names&quot; means either seven or more than seven, but the board is also granted the capacity to recommend fewer than seven where it takes the view that there are fewer than seven appropriate candidates to be recommended.  In my research with the JAAB members from 1995 to 2007, it was very interesting to talk to people about how this capacity was exercised over time.  In 1995, when Chief Justice Liam Hamilton was the chairperson of the board, they interpreted the legislation quite tightly and very few recommendations were made to Government.  That is backed up by research evidence from members of the Government at that time.<br\/>However, in the early 2000s a member of the board raised a potential difficulty with its operation, namely, that by acting in this way the board was potentially unconstitutionally usurping the selection function of Government.  It was argued that rather than making a selection of preference from the pool of applicants and identifying the preferred candidates to Government, the board should recommend all applicants who were not unsuitable.  This was the opposite approach to what had been practiced before - weeding out the people who were demonstrably unsuitable and recommending everybody else to Government for appointment.  The new approach meant that if, say, 20% of people were definitely unsuitable for whatever reason, of the 100 District Court applications, 20 would be weeded out and 80 sent to the Government from which list it could choose a preferred candidate.<br\/>This change dramatically widened the scope for Government discretion in judicial selection, if it wished to choose a preferred candidate from the list.  It is counter-intuitive for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which - by statute - had been given an extraordinary new role in judicial selection and had the capacity to make a selection decision, for example to choose seven or fewer applicants out of 90 or 100 for the District Court, and send that selection to Government.  It is difficult, because there is an independent board, and as long as the Government makes selection decisions from the recommendations of that board, the Government cannot be accused of acting politically in its appointments.  What is extraordinary is that the JAAB would have widened the discretion of Government in this way, essentially relinquishing the selection role it had been given without reference to this committee or the Oireachtas generally or to the Government.  <br\/>The JAAB operated in that way from the early 2000s until the end of my research in 2007 and  I am given to understand that it continued to do so for years afterwards.  It was reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that a decision was taken by the board this summer, 2014, to return to recommending a smaller number of names to Government.  I do not know how many names, I only know what was reported.  It is a very important point for this committee in its assessment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, because a range of people, including myself in 2004, have argued that the number of names should be reduced from seven to three.  That argument assumes the JAAB was actually recommending seven, which is not the case.  This committee needs to look in a very detailed way at the operation of the JAAB over time.  It has been in existence for nearly 20 years now and it seems reasonable that questions might be asked of it about its processes and operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill"},{"type":"speech","time":1416995400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I have a final question for all of our experts regarding the difference between the superior courts and the District and Circuit Courts.

Whereas our superior courts deal with matters of constitutional law and are, as Dr. Carroll MacNeill put it, empowered to override the Government - there are matters of politics at stake - this political salience is significantly less acute in the context of the lower courts.  If a genuinely independent body were established to make judicial appointments entirely separately from the process of Government - which would require a constitutional change - it should probably not be considered for High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court appointments because they involve genuine political issues that should be considered by somebody with political accountability.  There are checks and balances that need to operate with constitutional-level courts.  It is, however, something that might be considered for the District and Circuit Court appointments process, where the political stakes are lower and there is more risk of patronage.<\/p><p>  There is scope for making this differentiation either quite radically or in terms of the criteria according to which the applicants are considered.  We might look for different things from superior court judges who are empowered to deal with the constitution and perhaps make more politically salient decisions.  We might want to differentiate in a more significant way as opposed to applying a one-size-fits-all measure.  Compounding that is the fact that the criteria for all appointees are so vague at the moment.  As Dr. Cahillane mentioned, the board looks at things like education, professional qualifications, temperament and character, competence and probity in practice.  Those are not things that are binding, rigorous or constraining in terms of the choices.  We might want to specify what we mean by them and actually lay out what we believe judicial merit is.

I think they are all equally important.  The role of the District Court judge is just as important as that of the Supreme Court judge although they perform different functions.  The District Court judge is where most Irish citizens come into contact with the courts and it is extraordinarily important that the judges are courteous and of the appropriate temperament.  They must be able to make the correct decisions and deal with very long lists and all of the different personalities and legal issues that will come before them on a given day.<\/p> <p>I take the view that there is a very important role for political representatives in the selection of judges.  The tendency is to write out politics, but what one is doing there is writing out people's representatives.  All of the members of the committee represent people and have a sense of what they want and what is important to them.  Political representatives can make assessments on whether a person has the right temperament, which is one of the criteria to be a judge, all other things, including merit, qualifications and experience, being equal.<\/p><p> The requirements for a judge will be different depending on the court.  There is no way to distinguish them and I take a very strong view that politics must play a strong role in the selection of judges.  If one delegates responsibility for selecting judges to the Judiciary or an independent board and removes the direct role of the people's representatives, it is to make a serious decision about the constitutional order between the role of the people and the judicial function.  It is not part of the constitutional judicial function to select judges.  It is appropriate that the law-making majority, which is the members here, makes decisions on the type of system we have and the type of people they want to be judges.  That includes the diversity issue.  It is entirely appropriate that politicians take a view that there is a public policy imperative to appoint more women.

Neither report defines what they mean by \"political\" and it must be inferred that they mean party political patronage as opposed to any other form of acting politically.  The recommendations focus largely on the number of recommendations to be made to Government.  I find it frustrating because the powers to make more rigorous selections are already contained in the legislation.  They are already the preserve and previous practice of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  When looking at the criteria for selection, my colleagues have noted that they are vague.  However, I take the view that it was the Oireachtas giving the board extraordinary powers to define these things for itself.  I suggest the committee asks the board what its objective criteria are.  Does it need to be written into statute or is it something that has already been given in an extraordinarily broad - not vague - way to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?<\/p><p>  The merit principle is one of the recommendations of the judicial appointments review committee, which it is explicitly suggested should be written into legislation.  It does not seem to be problematic, but the inference is that the recommendations it has been making have been based on something other than merit.  That does not seem to add up.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has played a very effective role.  While it has widened its discretion, from the perspective of Government there were 116 judicial appointments between 1995 and 2007, of which 111 were made from among the candidates recommended by the board, ten were promotions and only one was an appointment made outside the advisory process.  Government uses the JAAB recommendations.<\/p><p>  The board has all the powers already.

The judges' report from January and the GRECO report have interesting recommendations to make.  As Dr. Carroll MacNeill mentioned, the merit principle is something that was pushed by the judges in their report in January.  As many of us have mentioned, one of the problems with the vision of merit outlined is that diversity is outside it.  It would be important rather than to simply put the word \"merit\" in a statute, which is breathtakingly vague, one needs to say what merit is and what one is supposed to be looking for.  I disagree with Dr. Carroll MacNeill to some extent.  If what was provided for in the 1995 Act was a broad power to set different standards, it was too broad.  Given the importance of legislation and elected representatives having a role in saying what we think a good judge is, those criteria should be more specific to provide for a legitimate, popular input into the criteria that are important when assessing judges.  Rather than to include a simple line about merit, I would like to see a vision of merit articulated and debated by our popular representatives.<\/p><p>  Looking at the composition of the appointments board is very important and something Dr. Cahillane mentioned earlier.  Neither report really looks at that and whether we should have more lay members and fewer judges rather than to let judges appoint themselves, which creates problems.  Promotions and the appointments of the Chief Justice and Presidents of the other courts are currently handled outside the advisory board process and they should potentially be brought inside whatever system we implement.  That would be worthwhile.<\/p><p>  I agree with Dr. Carroll MacNeill's assessment that what we need to look at is not cutting politics out - that is never going to be a good idea - but at the roles in which politics is problematic and whether there is a way to maintain strong political involvement while removing concerns about political patronage.  That is the chief concern at the moment.  This is very controversial among our sitting judges in particular, who would not be fans of this.  Hearings in this committee would be a good idea and direct popular discussion between elected representatives and judicial candidates could be used to gauge temperament, character and qualifications.  That would be very useful but not a popular suggestion among our current judges.  They feel it would make the system too political.  However, it is always political and the question is whether one wants to bring out the politics that is always at play and have it in an open forum with elected representatives engaged in the discussion or leave in some deeper process we do not fully understand.

It would be a fascinating research subject to take a proper look at this question.  We know that there are incredible barriers to entry for the Bar.  One of them is the fact that it is expensive to train at the King's Inns, which is the only option at the moment.  There is a huge up-front cost for that and there is no one else to cover it.  One must borrow or find money somewhere to pay for that.  One then faces two years of devilling as a junior barrister for which one will earn a little money.  One then goes out on one's own and tries to find work, but it is unclear what income one can expect in that period.<\/p><p>  It has been said a lot recently that there is a significant improvement in the number of people going to the Bar, both in terms of gender balance and background.  The question is whether or not those people are staying at the Bar.  The attrition rate at the Bar is huge.  A large number of people do not stay past a few years because it is not financially viable for them to do so.  The real question we need to ask therefore is whether or not - even if there is a greater diversity of entry to the King's Inns - people are staying to reach the senior level and then become judges.  I do not know the answer but I would suspect - given the barriers are so substantial and given how many people do not stick with the profession - that it is probably still a significant issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600007#F02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416996600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>The appointment of solicitors is an important element of that.

Canvassing went two ways.  People would canvass the Government for appointments and there was reverse canvassing when the Attorney General might go to the Law Library and say, &quot;I cannot guarantee it, but if the Government was minded, would you be interested?&quot;  In respect of canvassing members of Government, it did not go well for the people who looked to canvass.  A pre-1995 Minister for Justice said:<blockquote><br \/>Often, the strongest lobbying is done for the least meritorious candidate.  I remember one in particular for the District Court who was brought into the D&aacute;il and brought to visit the different Ministers' offices.  I recall it was very unfavourably commented on in Government.<\/blockquote>Another Attorney General said:<blockquote>It was preferable that it did not happen.  I may have received only five or six letters in my time as Attorney General; very few.<\/blockquote>There was also indirect canvassing by lawyers.  A post-1995 Attorney General said:<blockquote>I was certainly approached by barristers.  &quot;Have you given any thought to so-and-so?&quot;  &quot;You know so-and-so.  His time may have come.&quot;  &quot;What about so-and-so?  His wife has a health thing, you know?  I think he is keen to leave the rough and tumble behind.&quot;  But it was very counterproductive within Government to approach Government and canvass in that way.<\/blockquote>The other point is the canvassing of sitting judges for promotions and different ways in which they would do it, either by writing letters or by having a more or less discreet word in the ear of the Minister of the day.  Again, it tends not to work.  However, the issue of judicial appointments is very important.  There has been an increase in the number of promotions between the Circuit Court and the High Court since the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Promotions are outside the remit of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<\/p> <p>On the one hand, one might take the view that it is a threat to independence for judges to be promoted, as they might act in a particular way that is favourable to the Government.  Yet we have always had promotions between the High Court and the Supreme Court without really thinking about it.  We would have to be careful if we were to try to bring that measure into the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, about the question of whom to promote from a given court and how that would work.  There would be the sitting court presidents assessing that so-and-so wants to be promoted, and let us say so-and-so is not promoted, and they all know so-and-so looked to be promoted, but they made the decision that so-and-so was not okay.  There would be a need to be careful about the operation of the board, and we need to think about how that works.<\/p><p> In respect of political appointments, I make the point that it varies considerably between District Court and superior court positions.  One post-1995 Taoiseach said that when it comes to High Court appointments, at that level politics does not matter as the people tend to pick themselves.  Other people took a different view which points to the importance of being known to the decision makers.  A pre-1995 Minister for Justice said that, generally, Government appointments were made on observed merit, but if there were two equally meritorious candidates, then Fianna F&aacute;il will appoint Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael will appoint Fine Gael and so on.  The truth is that if you know people, you are generally more comfortable about appointing them.  That was something that came up again and again from members of Government.  Between two candidates of equal merit, they were much more comfortable appointing the person whom they knew personally because they could attest to that person's character and temperament in a way they perhaps could not for the other candidate.<\/p><p> All of the people who contributed to the study took the appointments process enormously seriously and were aware that, whoever they appointed to the High Court, their name was attached to that appointment for the period the person would be a judge.  If a judge did something mad, that could come back reputationally to the person who appointed them, and that was important, so they took it very seriously.  It is a natural thing to do and it happens within the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board as well.  If a person is not known to them, that person has great difficulty in getting through that.  As Dr. Cahillane said earlier in respect of geography, this has implications for the composition of the Judiciary and who gets through.  The legal profession is very Dublin-based and the people who are known to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board are more likely to be Dublin-based than not.  Does this exclude very good candidates from the rest of Ireland?  I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600008#G02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416997800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>We will now hear from the Donegal-based Deputy Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600009#H00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1416997800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I apologise for being a little late.

While there are definitely questions for the Legislature in terms of whether a sentencing council is a good idea, the diversity of the people on the bench will inevitably alter the way people engage in issues like sentencing, because different perspectives will force the judicial dialogue to be broader and include different perspectives that previously would have been heard as irrelevant, beside the point or whatever else.

What are the witnesses' views around a legislative framework that could ensure, certainly at that level within the Supreme Court, that there is a range of diversity of experience, including academic experience?

While it is not universally true, there is a perception that we have a Judiciary that believes there is a sort of set of legal skills one can use to decide cases in the best way, and this can be acquired by anyone.  I would certainly be of the view that, in questions of constitutional law in particular, though in many other areas of law as well, how one reads the Constitution, what one thinks it is for and the purpose and values that it stands for, are things that matter in terms of how one interprets it and how one reads it.  Those things can then have a net effect on the outcome of certain cases.  There is a variety of both theoretical and academic literature in the United States talking about precisely that question, and many senior judges in the United States would quite freely acknowledge that in the most difficult cases, social vision, what one thinks society is trying to do, can play a role.

That is the importance of the role of politics.  If, for example, Supreme Court appointments were delegated in some way to a body dominated by the Judiciary, would the Judiciary take that same line, or would it take the view the Supreme Court was being too conservative and that it should have a broader range of perspectives?

It is not entirely broken; it has worked with a degree of merit, but certainly what we and the delegates have been saying points to some of its deficiencies, particularly on diversity.  Ultimately, judges should be appointed by the Government because there is then a layer of accountability and responsibility, to which Governments have to live up.  How to go about selecting the best candidates is where we come into the debate.  Whenever political appointments are made, there will always be criticism, for example, in the case of the chair of the independent policing board who was appointed recently.

If somebody was appointed to a position in, say, the medical profession and remained in that position for many years without receiving any training, we would be concerned.  It has come to my notice recently that if a judge specialises in a particular area, say, family law, to the exclusion of others, he or she may find himself or herself constrained and not have full knowledge of what is happening beyond it in society generally.  The idea of having a specialist judge has been criticised from that point of view.  Perhaps the delegates might like to comment on the general issue.  Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill mentioned complaints against judges, an issue which possibly might be linked.  We know that it is virtually impossible to impeach or remove a judge from office.  If a judge is behaving in a strange way, one can go to a higher court to have changes made.  We have all come across cases where judges reacted in strange ways in court in terms of their comments.

That Bill would deal with issues surrounding judicial discipline and removal, but so far as I am aware, there has been nothing further since.  A comprehensive review was carried out by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham around the year 2000 which provided a good basis for legislation on the issue.  These are issues which have been researched extensively, including sanctions around judicial conduct, issues around the removal of judges, as well as lesser sanctions which could be invoked.  There is no lesser sanction for a higher judge, but there are various informal sanctions for District and Circuit Court judges.

The first Bill came out in 2005 and, as I understand it, sat with the Judiciary for some years.  It was eventually negotiated to a point at a judges' conference and has now come back as heads of a Bill, but it is very slow.  <\/p><p>  On the technical specifications, it is a fact of life that legal practice has become very specialised.  It is very rare to find somebody at the top of the Chancery lists and at the top in family law practice.  It is matter of concern to judicial education that one will not have somebody at the top of every list - criminal, commercial and everything else.<\/p><p>  To respond to the Deputy's question, the safest way for me to approach it is to take something from the research carried out.  The difficulty was raised by all of the Government contributors.  The universal concern was that, in exercising its Executive functions, the Government would end up appointing somebody totally unsuitable without being aware of it.  A pre-1995 Minister for Justice said: \"Our Attorney General used to say to me that you just never know what you are going to get.  You have the most eminent solicitors and barristers and they turn out to be the most dreadful judges once they are appointed and then the more moderate lawyers can turn out to be simply brilliant judges.\"  The point is that one does not know what one will get.  Just because one is an excellent lawyer does not mean that one will be an excellent judge.  Just as important as legal education and professional skills are temperament, character and the capacity to turn around judgments quickly so as not to leave litigants waiting for years and years for judgments.  It is complex, but that is the safest way of addressing the Deputy's question.  The fact that one does not know what one will get is another good reason we should look at how candidates are assessed by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I have mentioned that in England and Wales there are various methods used.  There is situational questioning, as well as moot courts where a judge is placed in a pretend court and has to give a judgment.  They are assessed on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600010#J02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill"},{"type":"speech","time":1416998400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>In role play and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600010#J02400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416998400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600010#J02500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416998400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>By way of example, some Irish judges go to what is called Judge School in Scotland.  One of the issues that might face a male judge is how to take evidence from a lady wearing a full burqa in circumstances where he cannot see her face.  Does he go into chambers and is the lady going to be comfortable with this?  Can one take evidence and so on?  These are human issues that have nothing to do with legal expertise but are a necessary part of the judging function.  The Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland and its processes provide a very useful comparator because the legal profession in Scotland is about the same size and because the population of Scotland is generally the same and the two boards have been given very similar powers.<\/p> <p>The Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland which is dominated by laypersons and chaired by a layperson takes a much more rigorous approach to the investigation of different candidates, including interviewing and role playing.<\/p><p> It was stated in the D&aacute;il in February that the Chief Justice had written to the Minister for Justice and Equality indicating that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board would begin to conduct interviews.  This power has been in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation for 20 years.  I do not know whether interviews were conducted in the more recent appointments.  While one would expect that they were, given the number of appointments involved and the statement by the board in January that it would engage in interviews, I do not know if that was the case.  It would be very important to ensure sitting judges were not involved in interviewing judicial aspirants, as any such involvement would present a very strong threat to judicial independence.

We heard about the need for members of the legal profession to gain sufficient experience to give themselves an opportunity to be considered for a judicial appointment.  This takes X number of years in one's chosen field of the law, whether one is a solicitor or a barrister.  Unfortunately, from my observations on either side of the legal profession, career progression depends on who one knows.  To pick up on Deputy Finian McGrath's point, it is very difficult for legal professionals to keep themselves in the Law Library and acquire the experience members of other professions automatically gain when they secure a job after qualification.  The same applies to some extent at the level of the Law Society.  If one is not connected, one cannot reach the point where one would be considered for a judicial appointment.  <\/p><p>  The Chairman made the point in reverse when he referred to not knowing people and, therefore, not being considered for a judicial appointment.  It turns the argument on its head when members of the legal profession and the Judiciary and those who observe the Judiciary, including the three delegates, consistently argue that the political appointments system can and often will show a certain bias towards particular individuals.  Dr. Carroll MacNeill referred to two individuals who had the same qualifications and one enjoyed certain political patronage.  My view is that one should toss a coin.  If the appointee happens to have political patronage, only time will tell whether he or she will be a more or less effective member of the Judiciary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600011#K00600","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>The Deputy must ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600011#K00700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Dr. Cahillane's paper addresses diversity, an issue that has been well covered.

Men gave a range of answers to this question, alluding, for example, to professional merit, proficiency in the Irish language and so forth.  There was no ambiguity in the responses of the women, however, and this has been reflected in some of the comments made by members of the Government over time.

She has 70 independent institutions throughout the country for whose conduct she is indirectly responsible, with no mechanism by which to encourage helpful, or censure unhelpful, behaviour.  The judicial council is the solution to that.  It would be a forum within which to raise complaints of a more minor nature.

The evidence from the research is that the lay members on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board have a very minor role on the board, speak very little, and have very little influence in terms of the decision making.  It is dominated by the judiciary.  The practice is the members look at the applicants and the senior judges speak first.  The lay members speak last.  In contrast, in Scotland, where there is a lay chair and a majority of lay members, different practices are adopted which give the lay members a more meaningful role.  For instance, when the applications are considered, there are no photographs or names.  They are reviewed in the first instance blind, just on qualifications and experience.  The lay members are allowed to speak first.  This results in a totally different objective assessment.  In Ireland, the name is known and a photograph is provided so that a person can be absolutely sure he or she knows who is being spoken about.  If, for example, the Chief Justice were to open the conversation by saying she knows Jennifer and she is a wonderful so and so and the President of the High Court were to say something similar, by the time the lay members are reached, it is very difficult for them to have an influence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014112600012#L01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999600,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Dr. Carroll MacNeill has made a very good point on lay members.

While there are substantial additional requirements in respect of the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service of &euro;75.24 million and &euro;9.25 million, respectively, they are being offset in part by savings elsewhere within the justice Vote of approximately &euro;24.7 million.  Thus, in real terms, the external funding requirement is under &euro;60 million.<\/p><p>  The Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality is contributing at least &euro;22.3 million to offset the cost of the Supplementary Estimates and there are savings of approximately &euro;1 million in the Vote for the Property Registration Authority.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Vote for the Courts Service is self-funding in that savings, including surplus receipts income, are being utilised to offset expenditure requirements in other areas of the Vote.  After allowing for the various adjustments, it is expected that the Vote for the Courts Service will have a surrender balance of approximately &euro;1.4 million.<\/p><p>  It is not uncommon, given the fact that the justice sector Vote is made up of five Votes, that there is a need to adjust budgets across the group as part of the Supplementary Estimates process.  This is particularly the case prior to year end to ensure maximum value is derived from any funding which becomes available.  The largest individual element of the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relates to the payroll subhead where there is an additional requirement of &euro;65 million.<\/p><p>  It was brought to my attention shortly after I was appointed Minister for Justice and Equality that there would likely be a substantial shortfall in the Garda pay subhead in 2014.  I made this one of the priority issues to be addressed in the recent Estimates and I am pleased that &euro;40 million in additional funding is being provided in the Garda pay subhead in 2015.  This addresses the shortfall in the subhead and also allows for the recommencement of Garda recruitment, with an initial 100 recruits having started their training in Templemore in September.  I am pleased to confirm that another group of 100 recruits will commence training in early December and be joined by a further 100 recruits early in the new year.  These are the first Garda recruits to enter the college since 2009 and these new garda&iacute; are needed to contribute to the revitalisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  The Supplementary Estimates process is also the mechanism we use to deal with the capital investment announced on budget day.  In total, &euro;10 million is being provided and this funding is reflected in the ICT and transport subheads.  An additional &euro;7 million is being assigned to the capital element of the transport subhead as part of this Supplementary Estimate and a further &euro;3 million will be available for the subhead in 2015.  This will result in the procurement and fit-out of over 400 new vehicles for the Garda fleet.  Deputies will be aware of vehicles coming on stream from previous funding and more will come on stream in early 2015.<\/p><p>  The ICT investment of &euro;3 million in 2014 will allow for a much needed information systems upgrade which will provide an essential platform for further systems development.  Obviously, I will not go into detail in that regard, but clearly it is a major issue for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have the appropriate technology; therefore, we must invest to bring the technology up to date.  <\/p><p>  There are various other overspends and underspends across the Garda Vote which are being streamlined through the Supplementary Estimates process before the end of the financial year.  There are surplus appropriations-in-aid receipts of almost &euro;22.7 million, a proportion of which relate to various pension deductions which are directly related to payroll expenditure.  Similar to recent years, certain receipts of almost &euro;17 million from fixed charge notices are being used as part of a technical accounting exercise to offset the cost of road traffic measures, mainly relating to the cost of the Go Safe road safety contract.<\/p><p>  It is clear from the Supplementary Estimate and the recently published Estimates for 2015 that the Government will continue to provide the necessary financial resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is also clear, as we have discussed a great deal at this committee and in the D&aacute;il, that there is a need for ongoing reform, to which I reiterate my commitment.  We have seen this in the recent Garda Inspectorate's report; we will also receive the Haddington agreement report early in the new year.  Obviously, the policing authority will be part and parcel of the new reforms.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to wish Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan all the very best in her appointment as Garda Commissioner.  She has a tough task ahead of her and a clear blueprint from the Garda Inspectorate to do her work.<\/p><p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;9.25 million is required for the Irish Prison Service in 2014.  The major components are: an additional payroll requirement of &euro;7 million; an additional requirement of &euro;3.220 million in the buildings subhead; an overrun of &euro;1 million in the compensation subhead.  There are offsetting savings of over &euro;1 million in the administrative non-pay subheads, including &euro;900,000 in ICT capital, &euro;400,000 in the prisoner services subhead and appropriations-in-aid of &euro;400,000.  The net outcome is an additional requirement of &euro;9.250 million in 2014 which has resulted from a number of budgetary pressures, including the full year cost of prison administration and support officers, PASOs, a number of recruit prison officers progressing to the prison officer pay scale in 2014 and the appointment of work training officers.  There were additional recruits in the course of the year that have led to these extra costs.  There were reductions made also in terms of the employment control framework, on which I can go into detail during the course of the discussion on the Vote for the Irish Prison Service.<\/p><p>  There is an increased capital allocation of &euro;900,000 in the prison building subhead in 2014.  This is offset by corresponding capital savings relating to ICT of &euro;900,000.  Work is progressing well on Cork Prison and expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015.  The modernisation project in Mountjoy Prison is also on schedule, with an expected completion date for the works on D-wing which includes in-cell sanitation expected to be completed by mid-2015.  The committee supported this project previously.  It is extremely important that we modernise prison buildings and there is further work to be done, but the progress has been extremely good in Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison.  There is also some development work ongoing at Wheatfield.<\/p><p>  The main reason for the Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of non-payroll expenditure relates to an additional requirement of &euro;2.3 million for current expenditure in the buildings subhead and is accounted for by essential works on heating and boiler systems across a number of prisons and the increasing cost of utility charges.  They were very old systems on which work had to be done.<\/p><p>  The Supplementary Estimate for the Courts Service of &euro;1,000 is of a technical nature in order to meet additional costs in some subheads by savings in other areas, including surplus appropriations-in-aid.  The increased cost of the annual repayment relating to the Criminal Courts of Justice complex, due to indexation, is &euro;700,000.  Deputies will be familiar with the new building.  There are additional ICT capital expenditure costs of &euro;400,000 following offset by savings in other capital subheads.  While there are some overspends and underspends in the administrative subheads which are offsetting each other through the Supplementary Estimates process, the main source of funding to meet the additional requirement is surplus receipts in appropriations-in-aid.  This surplus has arisen, in the main part, from a greater than expected intake of court fees, primarily relating to the Circuit Court and the High Court, both of which have benefited from the introduction of new fee orders in January 2014.  They have been used to offset costs within the Vote for the Courts Service, but it is also expected that the Courts Service will have a surrender balance of approximately &euro;1.4 million which will offset the additional costs in the Votes for the Garda and the Irish Prison Service.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that the Court of Appeal sat for the first time earlier this month following its establishment.  It is probably the most radical reform in the history of the Courts Service.  I thank everybody involved in ensuring it was established in such a timely way after the referendum was passed.<\/p> <p> There are many factors and issues that impact on the justice group of Votes and it is essential to have flexibility approaching year-end to offset additional costs in one area against savings in another.  Even allowing for the offset of additional costs against savings, it is necessary in the current year to provide additional funding for the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimates for the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service to the committee.  I will be happy to hear comments and take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014112600003#B00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417014600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The new Garda Commissioner has expressed her interest in and commitment to the development of the Garda Reserve and is on record as saying this.  Recruitment is ongoing and actually is an independent process as the Public Appointments Service interviews on a rolling basis at a range of locations around the country.  It is interesting that, to date, 40 members of the Garda Reserve have joined as full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that 23 members of the Garda Reserve commenced their training as full-time garda&iacute; in the Garda College last September.  It is clear that many people who have an interest in a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na join the Garda Reserve, build up their experience and knowledge of the force there and then go on.  It also is worth noting that the Garda Reserve has been highly successful in attracting non-Irish nationals to its ranks, as 67 members of the Garda Reserve are non-Irish nationals from various countries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked me about the allowances.  The annual allowance payable to Garda Reserve members as a contribution towards their expenses is set at &euro;1,000 per annum.

They also are reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a member of the Garda Reserve.

The first petition, No. 33\/13 submitted by Mr. Henry Gaynor, relates to equality and fairness regarding the raising of the State pension age to 66 and beyond.  The petitioner has an issue with \thaving to sign on for jobseeker's allowance between the age of 65 and 66, from 1 July 2014.  He feels any changes introduced in the interest of equality, fairness and justice should only affect new entrants into the workforce, not existing members.  The petitioner also raises the issue that employers have no obligation to retain staff beyond the age of 65 should they wish not to claim jobseeker's allowance and, therefore, legislation needs to be introduced compelling employers to keep people on beyond the age of 65 as a result of the new changes.<\/p><p>  The committee has agreed a comprehensive number of actions in this regard.  First, we will write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, asking him to outline the following: (a) the procedures that have been implemented to cater for employees who must retire at age 65 and who do not qualify for the State pension until age 66 and whether the Minister has instructed all Departments to award a one-year extension to these employees should they apply for one: (b) whether an individual's occupational pension, paid by the Paymaster General, will take into account the difference in payment paid to the individual between age 65 and 66.  At 65, payment would be approximately &euro;188 per week, whereas at 66 this payment could be up to a maximum of &euro;230 per week; (c) whether a civil or public servant who has reached age 65 and is informed he or she must retire can take a case to the Equality Tribunal; (d) whether the Department has any statistics available as to how many civil and public servants have applied for a one-year extension to take them to age 66.  Of these applicants, how many have been refused an extension; (e) in a response to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on 30 October 2014, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation claimed that some employers are offering a one-year fixed term contract up to age 66 to facilitate employees affected by the pension changes.  Will the Minister indicate, whether, since the removal of the ban on recruitment in the recent budget, there is any intention to introduce a fixed term contract for employees between the age of 65 and 66 who wish to have such a contract rather than rely on applying for an extension on grounds of hardship as is currently the case?<\/p><p>  Second, we have also agreed to write to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation seeking clarification on the following: (a) why there is no legislation setting down a retirement age, as this could lead to inequality between employers; (b) the Department states in its response that in general employment rights legislation does not contain an upper age limit.  Will it clarify what is meant by \"in general\"?; (c) why is it the case that an individual who has been informed he or she must retire at 65 may find himself or herself in a position where he or she may need to take a case to the Equality Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act?  Surely if a person has worked to the age of 65, there should be adequate legislation in place dictating whether he or she may or should be kept in employment until age 66.<\/p><p>  Third, we will invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to appear before the committee to expand on its submission.  Fourth, we will invite representatives from the interdepartmental committee on working in retirement, which was established to sort out these issues, to appear before the committee.  Fifth, we will invite the petitioner to appear before the committee and, sixth, following presentations from these three groups or persons, we will prepare a report to be debated in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  Finally, we will forward a copy of all correspondence previously sent to Ms Catherine Doran, in regard to the previous petition, 53\/12, to the petitioner, including the latest correspondence received.  It is also recommended that all new correspondence on this petition should be sent to Ms Doran to inform her that this committee is still trying to resolve the issue of the gap created by the introduction of this legislation.  We have agreed this comprehensive set of actions as we are agreed this substantial issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  The second petition before us is petition No. 17\/14, submitted by Mr. Eugene Mitchell, on the use by Galway County Council of public funds allocated for flood prevention in a specified area.  We have agreed to defer this petition for decision next week.<\/p><p>  The third petition before us is petition No. 19\/14, submitted by Ms Marian Groome, on the issue of water fluoridation.  She wants a review of the mandatory fluoridation of Irish Water, as she claims there are health issues associated with this practice.  She has not raised this issue with any stakeholder as she is of the opinion the issue needs to be debated in the D&aacute;il, which has happened in recent times.  While the Department states there is currently no issue in this country with water fluoridation, it has engaged the services of a health research board to conduct a review on the effects on the public's health and the environment of water fluoridation.  I invite Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to propose what we have agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014112600003#E00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017600,"counter":771,"content":"<p>We debated a number of possible recommendations and have decided to keep the petition open while we await the outcome of the review.
