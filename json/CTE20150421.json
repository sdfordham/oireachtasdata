What I want to present today is a project funded under the EU as a Creative Edge project with a number of partners including the Western Development Commission and partners in Finland and Sweden.  This will give the committee a sense of some practical pilot initiatives we have used to try and support the creative economy, given its importance in terms of both urban and regional focus.  Our project is a &euro;1.1 million project that finished in 2013.  We focused on three key areas: the roles of people, place and creative production, and the milieu of those three areas coming together to form a very vibrant creative economy.<\/p><p>A lot of research has been carried out examining the creative economy in an urban area.  This is the first time that a major research project has had an applied focus to look at this issue in a rural context.  There are many definitions of the creative economy.  Dr. Pat Collins and I are reconceptualising the way one would look at the creative economy, which would include creative expression, such as music and visual-audio performing arts, creative application and creative technology.  This is the way we examined the creative economy in the west of Ireland, Northern Ireland, northern Sweden and Finland.<br\/><br\/>This is the first pioneering mapping, at a very micro level, of the creative economy in rural areas of peripheral parts of Europe.  As part of the project, we established creative hubs.  Our colleagues in Northern Ireland looked at using vacant buildings to support the creative economy.  We also examined the possibilities associated with our website, <i>mycreativeedge.eu, <\/i>and ways a portal can support and internationalise creatives.  That was led by the Western Development Commission.  We had mentoring and training programmes.  All of these were successful pilot initiatives that made a difference in supporting the creative economy. <br\/><br\/>If we take the west of Ireland as an example, on the slide is a visualisation of the sector when looking at application, creation and expression.  We would consider it to be  a diverse sector which crosses a number of different areas.  Cultural consumption is important in terms of the number of theatres, museums and culture and heritage sites.  These are the science parks of the creative economy in terms of supporting and enabling people to access those. <br\/><br\/>There is an overall high-level mapping, which is available online if committee members are interested in looking at it in terms of their own context.  This is the high-level picture in terms of the areas that we looked at.  If we take the audio-visual sector, which is very important in Galway and the west, we see that it is very highly concentrated.  When we come down to the micro-level, we can see that there is a high concentration of audio-visual sector initiatives in Connemara, which is a result, I suppose, of TG4 and the evolution of that sector there.  My colleague, Dr. Pat Collins, has done a lot of work in terms of understanding that significant cluster.  <br\/><br\/>The other important part of it concerns creative education.  We mapped the creative education institutions on the island of Ireland.  We identified approximately 3,000 graduate places.  There is a need to grow that sector.  Graduates from creative courses are four times more likely to create jobs or to be entrepreneurial.  They are very significant in terms of job creation and enterprise.<br\/><br\/>We also created a portal.  Many of the creative companies are micro, one or two person, operations, although some of them are bigger.  The Western Development Commission pioneered <i>mycreativeedge.eu<\/i>.  This is a portal which a creative can join and put up a profile at no cost.  This has been very effective in terms of internationalisation, generating more business and creating a profile for the creatives.  In the first few months, up until 2013, 500 businesses had registered with it and it had approximately 36,000 unique visits.  For creative industries and one or two person operations, this is a vital source to give them greater visibility.  <br\/><br\/>In the survey, respondents said they wanted networking opportunities and more customised supports.  They were seeking a strong international orientation and better mentoring in terms of working with colleagues and building their businesses.  <br\/><br\/>Our colleagues in SEED in Northern Ireland established creative hubs.  This might be relevant in terms of vacant buildings throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  They created a template and a toolkit and they set up four hubs during the course of the projects.  These hubs are not-for-profit.  One or two people can go into a location and set up their businesses.  They receive mentoring and there is a whole stakeholder engagement which goes behind that so that these become sustainable hubs for creative enterprises.  This has been very successful in Ume&aring; in Sweden.<br\/><br\/>Our colleagues in Sweden pioneered the mentoring aspect.  They also pioneered working with creatives, graduates working with business and creating international meeting points.  Finally, our colleagues in Finland pioneered the idea of creative education, internationally, across the four partners, getting them to work with businesses in terms of the creative economy and looking at how they utilise their cross-media skills, which included working with a tyre company to create new products and services.<\/p><p>This is a critical sector for the national economy, one that would equate in terms of time to medical devices and ICT.  It is undervalued and needs to be recognised more in terms of coherence and in terms of policy.  We also suggest there be more detailed data, similar to what we have pioneered in this project to really map out the rest of the clusters of creative activity throughout Ireland because they are really important to society, rural society, and also in terms of economy.  In some senses if one has vibrancy in terms of creative activity and consumption, and also in terms of creation, they are like having many foreign direct investment companies in particular locations.  They keep coherency and vibrancy in the local economy.<\/p><p> We also would argue that there needs to be greater coherence at a policy level on co-ordination between the different actors responsible for this sector.  Our analysis of Sweden and Finland proves that better policy co-ordination, better regional supports and a more customised approach works and helps in terms of the sectors growing and flourishing.  We suggest having a ten-year plan to redevelop the sector, similar to successful models that have been followed for other sectors such as ICT, medical devices, life sciences, etc.  We are finding that there is a great appetite from the creatives in terms of the willingness and need to develop this sort of support.<\/p><p> When looked at from a regional and peripheral perspective, the place is the aspect that needs to be protected but also the place helps to harness the uniqueness.  Catalysts such as the specialised programmes we have just outlined will help to create new networks and create activity in terms of the internationalisation that is required.  Our project has shown us that we can create great connections on a pan-European basis between peripheral regions, working together to boost the economic activity in international trade.  Better use of broadband and access to all those kinds of things are critical.<\/p><p> On cultural consumption, 80% of consumption of cultural products comes from seven categories, the highest being television, radio and Internet.  It is very important that Ireland is well positioned in these cultural categories to be a very strong and dominant force internationally.  There needs to be more analysis of content because this is at the cutting edge.<\/p><p> On education, there needs to be enhanced, broadened understanding of skillsets, discipline and connections.  More data need to be collected in terms of creative education.  As we would do for other sectors, there is a need for creative innovation hubs throughout the country - mini ones like the creative hubs that we have pioneered with our project.<\/p><p> Those are just some thoughts we have on a project we have run for the past three years and also the research we have done for the past five years in this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the invitation to appear today.  I will speak about a document prepared by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, both in its report and its research report.  I acknowledge the input from my colleagues who are present.  It very much drew upon work within the Western Development Commission and NUI Galway.<\/p> <p>  Within the commission we regard the creative sector as being very important.  We devoted an entire chapter to it in the research report and there were some very specific recommendations for the sector, recognising the importance to which Dr. Cunningham referred.  It is a relatively varied sector building upon performance and expression, technology, and applications such as arts and crafts, etc.  It is recognised as a sector that can have an important impact, particularly in rural and more peripheral areas.<\/p> <p>  OECD research has shown that up to the middle of the last decade, the creative economy grew at twice the annual rate of the service industry and four times that of manufacturing.  There is a very high growth potential particularly for the sectors linked into the knowledge economy.<\/p><p>Given the structure of those businesses, they can be complementary to the needs of rural economic development.  The Western Development Commission highlighted the fact there are 5,000 businesses and 11,000 direct employees.  This is, therefore, a relatively big sector in the west.<\/p><p> The creative economy is a strength and has a competitive advantage for Ireland's rural regions, drawing upon our rural image and capitalising on the creative strengths, thus being a potential source of employment.  WDC research shows there is a difference between urban and rural creative industries, with the creative industries in rural areas drawing more upon the land and building, for example, fashion clusters in Donegal and craft clusters in Connemara and places like Offaly and Westmeath.  The WDC forecast estimates there are 17,000 potential jobs in the western region alone.<\/p><p> Some of the potential advantages of the sector are due to the fact it is an important indigenous sector providing incomes that benefit people living in Ireland.  It has strong growth potential, in line with other aspects of the economy, and often produces high-quality jobs, particularly in the locations in which they are based and especially in more peripheral areas where there may be fewer quality employment opportunities.  As a knowledge and creative sector, the sector can help stimulate innovation in the wider economy, particularly given its links with other sectors.  It can also play an important social role in making an area more attractive.  If there is a strong creative sector in an area, this can have spin-off effects on tourism and other visitor-based businesses and, as a result of its location, can promote rural and regional development.<\/p><p> As in all other economic sectors, people are important drivers for this sector, along with their skills, creativity and innovation.  However, there are skill needs.  The location of an industry relates to the attraction of a region, in terms of landscape, heritage, infrastructure, social network and quality of life.  This feeds in both directions, both drawing upon the environment in which it is based and contributing to the view of that area.  As in other sectors, creative supports relate to the infrastructure that can facilitate development, whether funding, networking opportunities, marketing capabilities and infrastructure, especially broadband infrastructure for IT-based businesses.  This is critical and was the number one requirement at every meeting CEDRA had throughout the country.<\/p><p> Our document provides a SWOT analysis.  I will not go through all the detail on that, but I will mention some of the high-level strengths, such as the high level, quality and diverse mix of skills throughout the country, the natural attributes of locations, and the creative supports where there is critical mass, particularly in Galway, Sligo and Leitrim.  On some of the opportunities, there are hidden skills and skills that are not marketed which do not generate an economic return within the sector.  There are also possibilities of having more businesses within unspoilt landscapes and opportunities for more export access.  A theme across rural economic development concerns how we move from supplying to a local economy to a global economy.<\/p><p> Some of the weaknesses in the sector are not unique to the creative sector and are typical of SMEs elsewhere, for example, capacity and business skills.  This fundamental gap was identified across the CEDRA report.  There may also be gaps in creative skills, for example, where we want to change the way we do things.  There are also gaps in terms of the availability of low-cost workspaces and challenges in terms of networking.  Some of the threats are the loss of key skilled people and, perhaps, a policy of focusing on attracting new skills rather than sustaining and encouraging existing skills.  Gaps in infrastructure also exist and we also face some of the other issues in terms of SME development, such as funding.<\/p><p> In regard to policy, concern was expressed in the report on the multitude and different sources of support and advice on capacity building.  This is not unique to the creative sector.<\/p><p>That was the fundamental point made across the CEDRA report, and the 21st recommendation in that report was the development of a co-ordinated strategy for the creative industries that places a specific focus on potential to contribute to the development of the rural economy, with consideration given to a specific mechanism that combines the creative economy's support competencies with the relevant Departments, many of which have been mentioned, as well as existing lead agencies.  In particular, there is the Western Development Commission, the Crafts Council of Ireland, the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  This should introduce a more integrated approach to funding in line with the overall approach advocated by the commission.<\/p><p> Fundamentally, the challenge in promoting rural economic development highlighted in CEDRA was the lack of co-ordination.  There are many institutions involved in supporting sectors but the question remains as to who is choreographing or directing all these different activities in particular directions.  In particular, we highlight the gaps within the creative sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Cathal O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Western Development Commission, WDC, formally expresses its gratitude to the committee and its members for the invitation today to make a presentation on the creative economy.  As my colleagues have already mentioned, we will address some of the national case but, more specifically, the regional case for the creative economy that we have discovered in our work.<br\/><br\/>As members know, the WDC has a statutory remit to foster and promote economic growth in the seven counties of the west.  We have a vision, as expressed in the notes available to members, about making a confident global region and all that pertains to that in the creative economy.  However, we are involved with much more than the creative economy.  We promote our region to individuals and enterprise globally and we have in excess of 1 million visits to the request website.  Through policy, access to finance instruments and innovative development programmes with partners, we have supported 1,899 jobs in recent tough times.  As such, we would welcome more time to discuss such issues with committee members under the theme of broader economic development.<br\/><br\/>There is a question of why we would consider the creative economy, and that has already been addressed by colleagues today.  It is globally important and of growing significance to advanced, knowledge-based economies.  Equally, for us, it is unique in a regional sense in that it is one of the few industrial sectors where growing thought indicates that jobs tend to follow people in the creative class rather than people following jobs, which has traditionally been the <i>modus operandi<\/i>.  Growing research also demonstrates that regions in particular are well suited to exploit this creative economy due to certain factors inherent within them.<br\/><br\/>The WDC has mapped, with partners, the creative economy in our region, and that forms much of the discussion today.  As has been mentioned, we have engaged with National University of Ireland, Galway, and the Whitaker Institute, Teagasc and others, as well as Oxford Economics.  Some of the key findings have been circulated to members.  The creative economy in our region is a sector employing almost 11,000 people directly.  It is a sector which engages nearly 5,000 businesses and it also earned more than &euro;534 million.  It also offers opportunities, and we know there is a very big opportunity now with exports.  That line is often trotted out but we have measured it through commissioned work.  There is a very low participation rate in exports among creative businesses and the value is very low indeed.  As such, that gives us good headroom in which to get products to a global market.  As has been mentioned by my colleagues, quality of life is essential to the discussion about the creative economy.  It begets success in many other industries and some would argue it is also the seed of innovation, and many of the regions in our country would be eternally grateful if we could move along in that respect.<br\/><br\/>That, in broad brush strokes, is the case for this being a significant sector.  We can consider what we have done in the previous six or seven years.  Along with partners such as the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, NUIG and the Whitaker Institute, Teagasc, the local authorities and many others, nationally as well as internationally, we in the WDC and through the good work of my colleague, Ms Pauline White, and others have engaged in trying to have a programme to develop growth areas within the creative economy.  We have some ideas on what has worked and what has not.<\/p><p>As members have already heard, we have put in significant effort in the Creative Edge, which has garnered 550 international businesses in the creative economy, allowing them to access global markets.  It is a beginning, not an end, but the access is now established.  Through another programme, Creative Momentum, we have an international expertise to assist growing in new markets and new product development.  For example, Finnish expertise is helping Irish capital to come together for new product development, which is always a good thing.  What is important from the point of view of the WDC, given our western investment fund and our background in venture capital, VC, expertise, we have an access to finance instrument, a micro-loan ability up to &euro;25,000.  We have earmarked &euro;1 million over three years.  That is giving creative economy businesses access to seed capital in terms of export growth.<\/p><p> In total, the Western Development Commission, WDC, with partners, has sourced and is directing almost &euro;4 million of risk capital to this critical sector, &euro;2 million of which is directly in the region.  For us, the creative economy is indigenous.  It is also immutable in that it is bound within our region.  That is really important because it gives different ways in which to tackle the creative economy, both in the urban centres and in the rural centres depending on the regional identity.  The simplest way to put it is that people come to my region to be creative because they are inspired by it.  They do not want Temple Bar any more.  They are looking for other ways in which to create goods and services and we need to get them to the world.  We are helping them to try to do that.<\/p><p> I will not go into the reasons the region is so inspiring.  We have a lot of data on it, but I will just mention some key points.  Galway is a UNESCO designated city of film.  Music and literature from the west is famous nationally and internationally.  In Yeats we have an iconic poet and in 2015 we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of his birth.  This is a national commemoration with which the west is proud to be associated, not just from a commemorative aspect but also from an enterprise and entrepreneurial aspect.  We have Aosd&aacute;na communities and film and audiovisual clusters.  We have all the components to make a world class global economy within our region and we believe that it is also the national story.  It is not just us.  As has been mentioned, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, has earmarked the creative economy as one of the areas of diversification in the rural economy.  We commend it in that regard and will work with it to achieve that goal.  The Action Plan for Jobs, an innovation of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has earmarked the creative industries for the deepest consideration in terms of support.<\/p><p> In essence, the WDC has sought to showcase innovatively and support this highly indigenous and sustainable sector within our region.  The next step in the vision is to grow the sector significantly in the coming years, with product development and exports being the key areas of development.  The WDC is working with national, regional and international partners and businesses to implement this using private sector, national and European funding.<\/p><p> To enable this transformation and have the creative economy truly become of global stature, it is essential to evolve the national support narrative to access broader enterprise development programs for the creative economy.  It cannot just be grant funded; it needs more sophisticated instruments of support.  Due to the highly indigenous, specialised and geographically rooted nature of enterprises in the creative sector, the WDC would strongly recommend consideration of a permanent regional creative sector development function to be established.  This would greatly accelerate realisation of a vision to create a global indigenous sector in the west and other regions and realise the revenue opportunities there.  Once again, I offer many thanks for the kind invitation and consideration of committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Brannigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the three gentlemen to the committee to speak on a very exciting sector of the economy, perhaps one that is not generally discussed although there is an individual focus on it.

To answer Deputy Kyne's first question, I do not yet think we are at the point where people feel they are part of the creative economy.  He is correct that someone working in the creative economy would consider himself or herself to be a jeweller, craftsperson or potter.  That is fine.  We do not need to change that.  The use of the term \"creative economy\" is one to use simply from a support and branding point of view, and it is important to be known as a global creative region rather than tinkering with the personality and brand identity of individual producers.<\/p> <p>  I could go into a lot of detail in terms of unique potential in the region.  The approach is twofold.  First, the quality of life attracts people to live there.  Addressing broadband and access infrastructure allows people to work there.  The second thing is that there are specific sectoral issues that are very welcoming to people within certain areas.  For example, a lot of world class photographers come to the west.  We did a bit of research on NUIG on the reason that was happening.  It turns out it is because of the light changes.  We always talk about the weather but it means that one photograph can be taken on a given day in several different lighting conditions and it looks good.  That is a reason a lot of photographers go there as well as the quality of life.<\/p> <p>  The last question related to the WDC's role in the Action Plan for Jobs.  I am very happy to say that we are very much involved.  To date, we have been involved in two to three of the regional workshops with the Minister.  We have been fully involved in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Brannigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In terms of the CEDRA recommendation, the fundamental objective across sectors is to have improved co-ordination of the instruments of the State to better generate rural economic development.

We organise ourselves within the State in terms of sectors, industries or pillars and whether it be creative industries or rural economic development in general, it is a cross-cutting goal.  That is very hard.  An outcome of the report was the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, as the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs.  That is a start in terms of co-ordination.  She has established an interdepartmental group where members of a variety of different agencies meet regularly and are preparing an implementation committee.  Fundamentally, that is hard.  A challenge to the group is the availability of human resources.  Perhaps more staff time could be made available to facilitate co-ordination.

When one looks at our colleagues in Finland and Sweden it is clear that could be even further enhanced.  It is necessary to grow the capacity.  If the industry is to grow as a whole, we need to ensure there is creative talent in terms of the early stage career graduates but also in terms of people who want to get into the industry in later life or want to change career direction.

In terms of the public mind, generally the small companies get shouldered out of the limelight by the larger ones.  When an announcement is being made about multinationals coming in, it is the first items on the news and newspapers and everybody is talking about it but the media tends to ignore the smaller initiatives such as those the representatives are promoting.  I am aware they promote all of them but, in general, they get a bad press and do not get the kind of publicity they deserve.  If there are ten companies which have five people each employed, that is 50.  When all of those are added the figures are significant.  There is a disparity of esteem about the operation, status and significance of the smaller companies.  I wish to give one example from my own experience in County Donegal.  When Radio na Gaeltachta was established in the peripheral areas of south west Donegal and north west Donegal, the Irish language was not considered a posh vernacular.  Younger people, in particular, were indifferent towards it, despite schools and their best efforts.  When Radio na Gaeltachta was established it had a very significant impact on promoting the language.  Once something was on the radio people saw it differently.  They heard their tongue being spoken on the radio with very important matters, such as current affairs and sport, being discussed.  It changed the psychology of people in the area to the extent that people thought that if the language could become important nationally, other things could be promoted nationally.<\/p><p>I know many younger entrepreneurs who have a great sense of get up and go to do things.  Many small companies in the tourism industry organise fishing trips, mountain climbing and other activities using local resources that were underused or perhaps never used properly.  The presence of Radio na Gaeltachta has provided a very strong psychological impulse.  Apart from the language, there are other things that are important.  In other places such as County Donegal there are small but vibrant and important local industries which together have a great impact.  That point struck me when the speakers mentioned that smaller businesses were as important in many ways as larger businesses that were in the limelight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#M00300","speaker":"1031","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":33,"content":"<p>One of the objectives of the CEDRA report was to try to shine a light on those sectors that were not as visible, including the SME sector in small and medium-sized towns.

There is a need for investment in infrastructure, including theatres, museums and tourist trails.  In reference to our colleagues in Northern Ireland, there is a need for creative hubs, places where people can meet in different types of network.  My colleague, Dr. Pat Collins, has shown that TG4 has spawned a global audio visual sector that employs in of the order of 600 people.  It is growing and international in its orientation.  What we have found in looking at Finland and Sweden is the importance of the economy, society and culture coming together.  These three elements when fused together give long-term sustainability because they are grounded in people's entrepreneurial and creative ability.  If it is harnessed and supported in a customised way, depending on the needs of a locality or particular region, it proves to be sustainable.  Clearly, in terms of growth rates, this sector is out-performing many others that we think are very successful.

Sometimes small is beautiful because, as well as being indigenous and immutable, it is rooted to whatever it is, which is always good.  The sector has a really powerful dynamic.  People will participate in it for a lot less than they would in others.  Speaking plainly, in gross value added, GVA, terms, what they will accept to be involved in this sector is way below what one would normally expect because they want to be involved in it for quality of life reasons, which is fantastic.  That means that one can have a vibrant society in a peripheral area because people want to live there and will be happy to accept a salary of &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 as opposed to &euro;60,000.  That is why some of the projections of 17,000 and 19,000 jobs within ten years seem to be aggressive until one looks at the GVA figures.<\/p><p>They are quite low.  It is &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000.  Many of the jobs are seasonal, part-time and lifestyle related.  That is the nature of it.  It is not any less valuable - small is beautiful - but it sustains a rural and peripheral community at a fraction of the cost of bringing in a large multinational.  While a multinational might be a nice solution - and I am not against it having worked for one for 15 years - this is a perfect balance because it achieves the same thing with people who will never leave because they are rooted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Brannigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>It does not get the same attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#O00200","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>That is what we are trying to articulate through things like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Brannigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I have been here for four years without getting excited by too many committee meetings, but this is fantastic.

This turns on its head the idea that living in a rural area is a disadvantage.  It is a distinct advantage to live in a rural area if one is involved in the creative industries.  I found it intriguing that the Irish language was not mentioned until Deputy Conaghan referred to it.  I might have missed something at the beginning, however.  I see the Irish language as an integral part of the development of the creative industries.  A kind of reverse migration can happen with the language.  If people can develop their creative industries as Gaeilge initially, it is very easy for them to migrate back to English as we have seen with the likes of D&aacute;th&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute;, Grainne Seoige and the band Altan, all of whom started as Gaeilge but then came back to a much more mainstream audience in the lingua franca of English.  We must realise that there is huge potential in training people as Gaeilge who also have very fluent English.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the connections with organisations like Skillnets.  Skillnets was utilised very well in the creative industry in Spiddal to do the kind of vocational training creative people wanted.  We are talking about training people in the creative industries, but the creative person tends not to like mainstream education.  They tend not to want to do degrees.  Degrees tend to have an element of homogenisation so that if one sends people to art or drama schools, they tend to come out doing the same type of art or drama, which loses their individualisation.  Artists in particular tend to shy away from that type of training, which is why we need a different model when it comes to the creative industries.  Skillnets has been utilised quite well, but there are also other options.  I would be interested to hear any thoughts the witnesses have on the use of the Creative Europe and Leader programmes to enhance the creative industries in the west.<\/p> <p>  There are outstanding examples of people who have turned rurality into an advantage.  I think of Philip King and his company, South Wind Blows, which is based in west Kerry, the way they produced \"Other Voices\" and the programmes they did on Irish music.  Philip has been very critical recently of the accessibility of broadband technology.  Surely, that must be given a bigger priority.  If we have a hub or a town where we intend to create one, we must ensure the top level connectivity is available.  Where do the witnesses see the hubs being based?<\/p> <p>  Links with third level are very important.  Third level options being available rural areas is also hugely important.  If one looks at the furniture college in Letterfrack, one sees a prime example of how one can take a niche course, put it in a rural area and have it create its own dynamic in that it brings people to the area.  It is within a community that is in itself very creative.  What do the witnesses recommend as regards third level colleges doing that?  The trend in the last number of years has been to contract, to pull in from the periphery and to take courses away from those rural areas.  For example, there has been a trend in NUIG to pull back on the number of courses that were available part-time and at weekends.<\/p> <p>  The other tendency of people in the creative industries is to multitask.  There are two elements to that.  They can multitask in a creative sense by being a writer, artist and filmmaker and do a number of different things.  We need to look at a model of supporting them that will allow them to either multitask or specialise in one area.  The other classic example of multitasking is where someone who is very good at pottery, for example, also wants to run a business but lacks the business skills.<\/p><p>There is then that innate fear of collaboration with someone who might be more <i>au fait<\/i>with business and marketing.  How do the witnesses see us overcoming that problem?<br\/><br\/>The witnesses referred to the area being given a regional status.  We know that there is a move within Europe to broaden the labelling idea so that if one gets a wine or cheese from a certain region, a classification is given to it.  Is that the type of regional branding the witnesses are thinking of in order that one could get an EU classification as a creative area which would given one a certain kudos?  It is something like the UNESCO idea of film in Galway.  Is that something that could be looked at?<br\/><br\/>I was in Denmark quite a few years ago where they had a fantastic concept of the cultural dynamo in one of the folk high schools.  The folk high school is like transition year but after school as opposed to in the middle of it.  One can do a course in whatever one wants after finishing the equivalent of the leaving certificate.  The one I visited was a creative arts school which had dance, theatre, film and music.  There was another element in the idea of cultural dynamos.  Cultural dynamos are the people who make things happen.  They are the people who see opportunities and that there might be funding available.  They can access resources and people who can do things, drag them together and push them to do the projects.  Do we have anything similar in Ireland where we create these cultural entrepreneurs and dynamos?  Is it something we should be thinking about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#O00600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":43,"content":"<p>As a matter of information, the Senator will be delighted to know in relation to his Irish language comments that TG4 representatives are attending our next session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I saw that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#P00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":45,"content":"<p>A couple of things arise.  When the Senator mentions the Irish language, I could not agree more.  Without judging it in any way, I would add the word \"authenticity\".  When the Senator refers to Philip King, which we have discussed, it screams authenticity.  For a creative product, an authentic experience is really important and it is what people pay money for in high-value products.  If one is speaking Irish, it is seen as an authentic experience and when it is created in that medium, they see it.<\/p> <p>  I am sure my learned colleague will have a great deal to say about the issue the Senator raised on third level.  We know there is an entrepreneurial deficit in our region, which is due to peripherality and other factors.  I would like to see people coming out of the creative courses having an add-on of entrepreneurialism to bridge that pre-mentoring gap where they can apply some business skills to the artistic abilities they have and move it on.  That would be great.  The Senator mentioned regional status.  I had not thought about a UNESCO type thing.  While there may be a branding opportunity in the fact that we are located in a region, it is a jump we would not make ham-fistedly.  We would like to consider it with everyone.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to multitasking.  We have discussed a great deal today the traditional creative sectors.

We think we have those type of break-out capabilities in the west and we are looking at all aspects of it.  Dr. Cunningham covered some of the segments.  There is creative technology based in some of the urban areas which we consider is very strong and it needs to migrate into the rural areas to a greater extent.

From our point of view in Teagasc, about two thirds of farmers require off-farm employment to maintain a viable household.  Therefore, businesses like the creative sector, which can provide part-time niche employment, are important in balancing the household budget.<\/p><p> As regards the Leader programme, the uniqueness and niche dimension to businesses within the creative sector are consistent with the goals of Leader funding whereby they should not duplicate or compete against existing money.

From our research in Finland and other countries, we have been looking at new modes of delivery, including shorter courses which are more tailored and focused.  In my presentation I mentioned the pro-academy model in Finland.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, creatives do not really like to do a lot of courses in the traditional structure.  They have an opportunity to work on a business idea.  If a person wants to learn something, someone in the group takes a lead.  That model is innovative and could be used in an Irish context.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Donoghue's point was about utilising the existing infrastructure in new and innovative ways.  The creative hubs idea in Sweden, which has also been piloted in Northern Ireland, is about getting people to meet and interact in different places, both formally and informally.<\/p> <p>  Like any sector, business skills are required at the early start-up stage to understand the marketplace.

In public or self-organised community spaces, people examine how to create different networks connecting people formally and informally.  This is where new ideas are generated.

It was strong on growth centres, but many people are living in small or medium-sized towns and wider rural areas.

As I said earlier, we did cover one of the aspects of why we are pushing forward the creative economy regionally as well as nationally.  The narrative is that there are people there who attract jobs because of their creative ability.  They are in the region for their own choice so they will not go elsewhere.  That is a great example of what the WDC and regional development do.  We are not interested in dividing up some sort of pie.  We are genuinely interested in the national well-being.  That is why we want to find sectors where we have international competitiveness.  The dumb question is, do we want to be internationally competitive as a country?  If so, we have to pick our strengths.  Renewable energy is a great example because we are not going to put up 1,000 turbines anywhere to generate gigawatts.  It thus becomes a question that if one chooses to do so, one chooses to do it in certain areas where there are good natural resources.  In the creative economy we have a strong international sector.  This is not balanced regional development, it is sensible economic development.  That is a really important thing to understand.  I would not be qualified to discuss another aspect.<\/p> <p>  The clustering effect has to happen, rather than it being forced.  Michael Porter's strategy is great but I worked it for 15 years and one must spend an awful lot of money to make it happen.  There are natural places in rural areas which allow agglomeration effects for clusters, that is, where people can go to meet.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  With the committee's permission, I will spend a second on Galway's bid to be Capital of Culture.  It is a wonderful idea.

It is a terrific idea.  Should there be a national directory?<br\/><br\/>I heard Mr. Phil Coulter make a presentation at another committee on which I sat prior to this one.  He said that if he was starting now, he would not attain the same success, nationally or globally, because there are no policies on promoting Irish performers on national radio and television in terms of air play.  Several artists are associated with that view and feel strongly about the issue.  Would Dr. Cunningham research it?  His comments on work placements linking creative graduates with industry are excellent.<br\/><br\/>Does Professor O&rsquo;Donoghue have any view on how we might incorporate business skills for young people?  They need to think of themselves as being self-employed because they are part of the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, although they may not think they are.  Much of their employment will be contract work and they will go back on social benefits when a contract ends.  Is there sufficient expertise in the LEOs to recognise the potential business of a young person?  Much of it comes from courses and taps into technology that is moving so rapidly that people may not recognise the potential when, for example, a girl or a boy designs something like <i>Minecraft<\/i>or writes <i>Game of Thrones<\/i>.  They have the potential and the capacity to do something fantastic.  Are we missing out by not recognising it?<br\/><br\/>Mr. Brannigan&rsquo;s point that jobs follow people in the creative class is well made and puts the matter in perspective.  How can we get away from the impression that many people graduating have that they must work for nothing for a long time?  They sign on and then have to try to find some work on a film or here, there and everywhere to build a CV.  There is no other sector in which a young graduate who has worked hard for three or four years is expected to work for nothing.  That is particularly evident in the creative industries and the technology sector.<br\/><br\/>Do any of the delegates have an input into developing the third level curriculum?

It is a fast moving, diverse sector.  We have noticed in counties Mayo, Sligo and Galway that there is almost an underground aspect to much of this, especially among young people.  My colleague, Ms White, recently attended the Rough Draft festival, although that is the wrong word for it.  Many creative technology people come together at their own cost to discuss how to improve their businesses.  At the first festival I attended two years ago there were 200 present and I was the only person from the public sector in the room and they would not let me speak.  They were, in effect, 200 micro-businesses.  That is the level of knowledge available, which one cannot read in a book.  As Senator Feargal Quinn said, one has to engage with them.  That is one of the reasons I would like to see a regional aspect to enable people to develop these links directly with the client base.<\/p><p>It would help them to build it up and LEOs and others to channel support to them.  On the impression that they must work for nothing, it is a question of making it a viable career.  The rewards are huge.  Our research has shown specifically that many salaries are lower because they are lifestyle-based or seasonal.  There is an acceptance of this and it allows people to work on the periphery.  There is no doubt that in some cases it is an apprenticeship.  That is why we would like to see a greater awareness of the career path in these emerging sectors to make entrepreneurial skills more apparent in order that people will work more for themselves and in that way develop self-worth in order that they will not feel they are being exploited in some way, while still learning the skills because ultimately it is their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Brannigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":60,"content":"<p>In terms of capacity building for business and financial skills, I came from a meeting this morning at which we focused on these issues within the farming sector.

There is a need and whether it be in farming, business or the creative sector, it is becoming more complicated to exist, survive and thrive in the business environment which is more complicated and volatile.  To be successful, it is important to be a manager, as well as an expert in whatever the business is.  While we recognise the need, there is no demand.  Almost the first stage in getting people to engage with the tools and supports is to create awareness and a demand.  We are working with 22 partners across agri-business, banking and farm organisations to try to create this awareness.  I imagine a similar approach would be useful in other sectors such as the creative sector.<\/p> <p>  I am not an expert on the skills set of the LEOs.  It was a view of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, that, while it supported the LEOs as development organisations, they needed to be proactive rather than passive.

I am delighted to be here.  I will quickly flick through various images on the screen which come from an exhibition which just closed in Milan on Sunday.  They will give members a flavour of the potential of the creative economy for our emerging and established design community.  The potential of the creative industries cannot be underestimated in terms of its impact as a catalyst for radical change.  Design, creativity and innovation are intrinsic to the future growth of Ireland's economy.  In the same way that Ireland has excelled in developing the agricultural, pharmaceutical and technology sectors, this is the moment to utilise the creative industries as a platform and tool for growth, innovation and economic development.  To do this, appropriate infrastructure and supports are required.<\/p> <p>  My role as the head of international programmes for Irish Design 2015, ID2015, and as head of innovation with the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has provided specific insights into the needs of these sectors.  ID2015 is a year-long initiative backed by the Irish Government exploring, promoting and celebrating Irish design throughout Ireland and internationally to drive job creation, grow exports and increase competitiveness.  The programme for the year includes presenting the work of Irish designers at high-profile events in design capitals including London, Paris, Eindhoven, Milan, New York, Chicago and Hong Kong\/Shenzhen.  ID2015 is being convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, in collaboration with partner organisations on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise Ireland.  It is an ambitious programme with more than 300 national and 50 international events throughout the year that aims to create 1,800 jobs over three years; generate an additional &euro;10 million in design-based exports; generate 200 new design business start-ups; facilitate 300 companies to attend international trade events; engage with an audience in excess of 3 million; and develop a national design centre.<\/p> <p>  The ID2015 programme is a significant undertaking and represents the start of a journey to position Ireland at the leading edge of design collaboration, integration and innovation.  To ensure its success and that of the creative industries as a whole, a long-term, strategic view from economic and cultural perspectives is required.  The broad spectrum of design disciplines represented by ID2015 includes, but is not limited to, architecture and the built environment, film animation and motion design; food design; furniture design; gaming, product and industrial design, textile design; crafts; fashion; and web interface and digital design<\/p> <p>  ID2015 has identified key strategic enablers that could be applied to the creative industries sector as a whole to drive job creation, innovation and balanced economic development in the creative economy.  These can be listed under the following headings: education, enterprise and innovation; communication and promotion; legacy, infrastructure and disruptive reform; and commercialisation and internationalisation.  In terms of the first heading, the development and implementation of an education and enterprise model in collaboration with all major third level institutions to develop a strategy that provides tools for creative industries students and graduates to become entrepreneurs with the capacity to trade internationally is recommended.  This can be achieved through tailored programs delivered in partnership with the network of local enterprise offices, LEOs, and incubation centres throughout the country or through new models based on international exemplars such as NeueHouse in the US directed by James Reilly or Highway1 set up by Liam Casey of PCH.<\/p><p>To foster innovation across an integrated eco-system of creative industries, the parameters for innovation vouchers or similar incentivised funding should be broadened to enable B2B innovation across multiple sectors.  An innovation brokerage system should be established to pair companies and assist in the development of strategies and relationships to realise innovative products and services.<br\/><br\/>To realise significant growth in exports, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and creative industries need to have access to international markets.  Sustained investment to enable participation in international events such as design weeks, fashion weeks and architecture <i>biennales,<\/i>as well as access to funding to attend trade events for creative industries, must be maintained and further developed.<br\/><br\/>Raising awareness of the quality and innovative nature of the creative industries is key.  Coverage in high profile international media enhances and elevates the international perception of Ireland and our design, innovation and technical abilities.<br\/><br\/>To ensure sustained growth and development of the sector, a level of infrastructural supports is required.  They include a benchmarking of the creative industries sector as a whole.  The Western Development Commission has done a substantial amount of work in that area in the western region.  We also need engagement on an inter-agency and interdepartmental basis to maximise resources and strategic development of the creative sectors.  Access to investment for the creative industries through grant aid or venture capital funding is key.  The development of projects and programmes that integrate design thinking solutions across the business and community sectors to drive efficiencies and provide a platform for new systems to emerge is important.  The development of design hubs or creative industries hubs to encourage networking, collaboration and the sharing of skills, ideas and expertise is recommended.  The launch of a Made in Ireland campaign and a strategy of supports based on models in the United Kingdom and the USA would increase the capability of Irish manufacturers and bring visibility to the types of product available in Ireland.  The creation of a creative industries policy and a future strategy for Ireland is extremely important also.<br\/><br\/>I will give a sense of the impact cross-sectoral collaboration can have, especially when coupled with international exposure.  As I said, I have just returned from Milan where we opened Liminal Irish design at the threshold.  It represented over 20 Irish designers and design companies.  It was the first time in 50 years that we had this kind of international exposure and representation.  The level of innovation and resulting products from this initiative were significant.  For example, companies such as Thomas Montgomery, a small furniture manufacturer based in Bray, partnered Perch Design Solutions which is based in Dublin and they launched a product called FLOAT, an integrated system for seating in office environments.  It integrates both social and work-based interactions.  I asked Mr. Stuart Montgomery, its chief executive officer, his impressions of attending the show.  In terms of interest, he had received 45 concrete leads and interest from global design brands such as Labofa in Denmark, Kloebar in Germany, Vanerum in Belgium and FASB in Italy, which are interested in either tertiary exclusivity of his product or developing licensing agreements.  That is the result of just one representation on an international platform.<br\/><br\/>Another example is Design Partners that has worked with an American company, Seed Labs Inc.  They are exploring the smart home market to uncover and deliver the potential of its technology and brand.  Seed Labs Inc. developed pioneering Bluetooth and connected solutions technology through its own software, protocols and chips.  Design Partners has helped it to translate them into a brand, an experience and product design language in the design of all their products.  Working closely with Seed Labs Inc., it launched its first control device, Silvair, in Milan in April and it is just about to launch in the United States.  That is important because these companies are positioning themselves at the forefront in shaping the future of connected and integrated devices.<br\/><br\/>Enabling these collaborations allows true innovation to take place.  Supporting and promoting collaboration across sectors and disciplines will enable more intuitive, responsive, user centred smart design products and services to emerge.  Ireland has an incredible opportunity to merge our assets, technologically, scientifically and creatively, with the creative industries.  Based on research being undertaken as part of Irish Design 2015, we have the opportunity to develop and support a defined policy and a strategic plan for investment in the design and creative industries for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I invite P&oacute;l &Oacute; Gallch&oacute;ir to make his presentation to the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#W00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inn teacht anseo inniu agus an cur i l&aacute;thair a dh&eacute;anamh.

T&aacute; muid lonnaithe i mBaile na hAbhann i gContae na Gaillimhe.<\/p> <p>  TG4 was established in 1996 as a public service broadcasting initiative to promote the Irish language and culture, raise the profile of the language as part of the Government&rsquo;s wish to create a bilingual society and normalise its use.<\/p> <p>  TG4 operates as a publisher-broadcaster.  We source most of our Irish language programmes from Ireland's independent production sector.  Through this and through all of the other services we buy from the Irish creative sector, such as marketing, digitisation, software and hardware, music, etc., we have a significant impact on jobs in the economy, innovation levels and Ireland's economic development.<\/p> <p>  TG4 has commissioned Irish language content from more than 100 independent production companies in Ireland.  Most of these are small to medium-sized enterprises.  We have particularly focused on sourcing content from companies which operate through the Irish language, and many of these are located in Gaeltacht and regional areas, thus bringing significant social and cultural benefits to these rural communities with the high-skill employment they sustain.<\/p> <p>  TG4 is committed to investment in high-quality original Irish language content produced by the independent production sector in Ireland.  We spend over 90% of our programme budget with this sector annually.  In 2014, we purchased &euro;22 million worth of Irish language programmes and services from the sector and a priority of our strategy is to grow this spend in future years.<\/p> <p>  TG4 also places an emphasis on nurturing talent in the Irish language creative economy through our development programmes which support first-time producers, directors and writers in the Irish language.  This is done through initiatives such as the provision of training courses for Irish language producers, writers and directors and support for media courses in universities and institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  IBEC's Audiovisual Federation research on the Irish film and television industry shows that in excess of 300 highly skilled and creative full-time jobs in the film and production sector are directly sustained by TG4 commissions on an annual basis.  TG4's Irish language soap, \"Ros na R&uacute;n\", now in its 20th year of production, creates a significant level of direct employment and contracted personnel in the local economy.<\/p> <p>  Through our work with the independent production sector in Ireland, TG4 also helps to develop the capabilities of the companies and individual talent with whom we work.  By investing in skills and training, services and technology systems and approaches, and by working to defined standards, the capabilities of the production and creative sector in Ireland are continually enhanced.  We also help to raise finance for the independent production sector through working with it to help it secure sound and vision funding from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, funding from the Irish language broadcast fund and European media programme in addition to helping them work with international co-production partners such as European broadcasters.<\/p> <p>  The effect of TG4's expenditure every year extends beyond the first round of our purchases such as content or marketing services as additional economic value is created further down the supply chain and in other markets.  Thus the effect of TG4's spending is multiplied as it trickles down through the economy.  The multiplier effect of TG4's expenditure, direct and indirect, in terms of contribution to Ireland's national earnings was &euro;74 million in 2014 with an employment impact of 1,150 jobs, including production sector jobs.  This reflects the level of TG4 expenditure in Ireland on indigenous programming and creative services rather than on purchasing these from international markets.  For every &euro;1 invested by TG4 in the creative industries in Ireland, it was worth more than &euro;2 to the economy of Ireland in 2014.<\/p> <p>  The creative industries combine conventional cultural industries, for example, film and television, publishing and advertising, with digital media, software and technology sectors.  Much is based on intellectual property, and the fast-changing nature of the creative economy generates many opportunities.  If the global creative economy was a country, it would be equivalent to being the fourth largest economy in the world, and it would have the fourth largest labour force with 144 million workers.<\/p><p>Research from Nesta also shows that creative industries rely much less on imports than manufacturing sectors.  The commissioning of programmes from the independent production sector and services we source from other sectors will continue to support a vibrant and creative production sector in Ireland, the Gaeltacht and other regional areas outside Dublin in particular.<\/p><p> Looking ahead for TG4, we are seeking to grow our contribution to job creation, innovation and economic development in the creative economy.  We aim to maximise the share of our public funding which we spend on Irish language content.  We also aim to continue to spend most of our programming budget with the independent production sector rather than purchasing content from international markets.  This will provide for investment in the creative sector and job creation.  TG4 is establishing a digital Irish language archive, sourcing systems, digitisation, archiving and other Irish language creative services as part of this important project.  Since the beginning of 2015, with the assistance of grant-in-aid from the BAI, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, TG4 has indirectly employed five people with language and IT skills to archive and catalogue its Irish language content.<\/p><p> These activities and many others will continue to sustain jobs and support the development of additional jobs, drive innovation and growth in the creative economy.  Our funding must be sustained to enable us to continue to make this valuable contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#X00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&oacute;l &Oacute; Gallch&oacute;ir","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I extend congratulations to all of the delegations.

Irish Design 2015 has received a very positive response from the sector which views the initiative as very encouraging and one which should be sustained.  We have run a series of open calls, which has provided a level of funding directly to the designers and design companies.  More than 130 individuals and design companies have received funding through the initiative.  We also had an open call for an international trade fund, which provides a level of matching funding to enable applicants to attend relevant trade events internationally.<\/p> <p>  We have just submitted our first quarterly report which shows that we had more than 50 designers at international events.  Alongside the event in Milan, we had a presence during London Fashion Week, which showcased emerging Irish fashion designers, and 21 designers at the Maison &amp;amp; Objet trade fair in January.  We launched the year with Showcase, our international trade show.  We were delighted to bring the exhibition, Weathering, to Beijing during the President's visit to China in December.  As a result, we saw a significant increase in the number of Chinese buyers visiting Ireland for the Showcase trade event, which was extremely positive. <\/p> <p>  On the international element of the programme, we have received considerable support from the embassy network abroad.  We are working with more than 25 embassies and touring a capsule exhibition that is also linking with some of the trade missions taking place in 2015.  This is a significant and positive development.<\/p> <p>  On the design courses available in Ireland, when I graduated from the National College of Art and Design, the entrepreneurial and business side was not a core component of courses.  As I stated, we are actively working with the institutes of technology and universities to roll out a programme in this regard in September as part of the new curriculum.  We will also develop a design education programme to encourage entrepreneurial activity at second level and this will feed into the programme at third level. <\/p> <p>  In terms of design hubs, they can be both physical and virtual and both have benefits.  There are examples in Ireland such as the Fumbally Exchange where a number of creatives are housed under one roof and able to share experience and expertise.  This model has proved to be highly beneficial.  NeueHouse, the model I mentioned in New York, houses a number of companies and provides flexible co-working spaces.  It serves as a very efficient recruiting mechanism for creatives for technology companies in New York city.  It is very important to have some element of this here and linkages between Ireland and other countries such as the United States.<\/p><p> In terms of the profile in the media, first and foremost, we need to be present at events to secure coverage.  We need to make the best representation possible in terms of quality, innovation and the type of product we choose.  It is also a matter of building relationships and partnerships, which are core elements of Irish Design 2015.  Internationally, we have developed very significant relationships with institutions such as the British Council, the Design Council in the United Kingdom and the V&amp;A where we will have a significant intervention later in the year.  We have also established links in New York, for example, with the director of the Museum of Arts and Design and Paola Antonelli in MoMA.  All of the relationships and partnerships we build make a major difference in terms of the type and level of profile Ireland enjoys and the and way in which it is perceived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I watch TG4 much more often that I initially thought I would because it is a highly engaging channel.  While I do not understand much of the vernacular, the reason I watch so many TG4 programmes is that their content is strongly visual.  The channel has brought a new eye and ear to matters of Irish interest which many of the other broadcasters have never captured or did not believe were worth exploring.  For example, one would not expect a programme on labourers in England, principally ordinary men who were working in tunnels and on roads, to be very engaging.  However, the human side of the story penetrates and makes the programme very engaging.  While I did that type of work for a long time, my wife, who is a great follower of TG4, never worked as a labourer.  She likes the channel because it takes ordinary things and makes them extraordinary, appealing and engaging and she and I have both become regular viewers.<\/p> <p>  As well as Irish labourers working in Britain, TG4 addresses the issue of emigration generally, including to America.  It does not always focus on those who have made it big, earned a great deal of money and returned to show off their success in Galway or Donegal but addresses topics that have been neglected and aspects of the experience of Irish people in America that are not normally explored.  One of its strengths is that it shows the fate of emigrants and features strong human interest stories and other issues that remained unexplored until now. <\/p> <p>  TG4 also features little corners of Ireland that have been neglected or that people have never bothered about.  Its programme makers go to these places to build a story of the area, perhaps using as a focal point a river and its salmon or trout fishing or the scenic value of a waterway or mountainous area.  It is amazing how engaging such programmes can become simply through their visual impact and the personality and sound of a landscape or river.  The story lines are frequently simple but profound in that they have a hidden quality which engages those who are willing to be engaged, as more and more people are.  Ordinary topics have become extraordinary and TG4 explores rich seams of the human experience of Irish people in different settings, contexts and spheres which mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC and RTE do not consider to be sufficiently interesting.<\/p><p>The interest is there, if it can be found and presented.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#BB00200","speaker":"1031","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Apart from the use of the Irish language, we will make every effort to maximise our audience and to welcome people to TG4.

In those ways we try to maximise our audience and try to create a bilingual society and normalise the use of the Irish language.<\/p> <p>  I accept the points made in regard to emigrants and the United States.  Recently we did a lovely programme on the tunnel tigers, those who spent years in the tunnels in London and elsewhere in Britain.  Also, a production company in Carna, S&oacute;nta, did a four part series, \"GAA USA\" on the history of the GAA in the United States, which covered from before the GAA was established to the present day and looked at its future there.  Another nostalgic programme was made by Bob Quinn from Connemara, a lovely programme on the Galtymore ballroom.  <\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we have managed to touch base with rural and other parts of Ireland is that we are a publisher broadcaster.  Therefore, we take most of our programmes from companies that are mostly based in their own localities and which mirror their own society.  In a sense, we have approximately 100 small companies scattered and dotted throughout Ireland supplying programmes and mirroring Irish life of days gone by and present day Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&oacute;l &Oacute; Gallch&oacute;ir"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I wish to make a quick point regarding labourers in the UK.

I have passed through the airport a couple of times recently and have seen the picture montages there that give a sense of what is going on in Irish Design 2015.  I would not be as <i>au fait <\/i>with design as others.  We know a little about fashion designers, such as John Rocha, Louise Kennedy, Orla Kiely and Lainey Keogh and from the Connemara perspective, Cniot&aacute;il Inis Me&aacute;in, seems to have done very well on the international market.  Philip Treacy is another Galway designer.  However, in other areas of design mentioned, such as architecture, I am not as <i>au fait<\/i>with designers.  How do we compare internationally in those other areas?  We are not in the same league as Milan, but would we be in the premier league or are we somewhere down in the third or fourth division internationally?  What do we need to do to bring ourselves up?  I am not necessarily concerned that individual designers be there, but that there should be awareness of their work.  How can we promote them more?<\/p><p>I am also conscious that many of our designers are members of the diaspora.  Do we have a brain-drain scenario in this regard?

In terms of how we compare internationally, we rank like with like.  Our challenge is that we do not have a huge number of product or industrial design companies of a scale which can compete from a cost perspective.  One of the stories in Milan is about a company called Dolmen, which has launched a device called Moocall.  I think it did it in partnership with the IFA.  It alerts farmers as to when a cow is about to calve.  It will send an alert to both the vet and the farmer.  Globally, that kind of product is worth billions.  The committee will be able to do the maths itself.<\/p> <p>  The point about the diaspora and the brain drain is critical.  We need, from a policy perspective, to start putting in enablers and infrastructure to make it attractive for our designers and our design community to remain in Ireland.  The whole fabric of manufacturing and production is changing radically.  I had a discussion with the CEO of Casino, which is one of the largest Italian furniture manufacturers in the world.  He was saying that even the Italian industry is changing.  A democratisation of manufacturing and producing is happening worldwide, and Liam Casey is responsible for some of this.  This gives the potential to individual or small companies to make and compete globally.  It also means there are more mergers and acquisitions, so they are competing against very large global corporations.  We need to put the infrastructure and supports in place for those on the middle ground.  We are not going to compete at every level, but we can identify where we can compete.<\/p> <p>  The Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has commissioned an audit of producing and making in Ireland.  Irish Design 2015 is also looking at a programme to see how we can map our resources.  Often the problem is not that we do not have the skills here, but rather that we do not have the visibility of the skills available in Ireland.  It is very important to bring some kind of a brokerage system to bear in order that we can enable people to produce efficiently and effectively in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We were asked what gaps there are in training at third level.  The animation sector, for example, finds it quite challenging to recruit animators in Ireland, although it is a thriving sector.  In respect of the fashion and textile sector, which was mentioned, we are working closely with the British Fashion Council.  It provides supports over a three-year period and a lot of that support is directly into the trade.  It will have placements with fashion manufacturers, producers and designers.<\/p><p>This gives those graduates the kind of live training and hands-on knowledge they need when they want to go out and make a name and business for themselves.

Does she think career guidance is reaching young people and revealing to them the potential of design as a career path?<\/p><p>Does she believe the arts offices should have a greater role in supporting any young people who come up with designs and linking them to the enterprise offices?  I recently had an interesting engagement with a young milliner whose house is overflowing.  What organisations can creative people approach about identifying spaces particularly in rural areas?  Is there a role for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland in this regard?  For example, Shannon Development may have some available property.  I mention that because I am familiar with that area.  In other areas there may be spaces that could be identified similar to the Fumbally Exchange Ms Allen referred to but that it would be more of a rural area.<\/p><p> Offaly County Council and the county enterprise board acquired a space, called the innovation hub, which includes a number of young technology companies which are coming up with all sorts of ideas for apps etc.  Perhaps that could be replicated elsewhere.<\/p><p> Each county has people with particular skills and crafts.  I will focus on one that I know well and I love its name, Offaly Crafty.  It does pop-up shops.  It is amazing to see what is going on in one's own county that one did not know about.  Is there not potential throughout the country to have permanent spaces where craft spaces can exhibit?  I do not know if each county can sustain that.  For example, many national craftspeople exhibit in the Core Crafted Design in Ballinahown.  Could each county sustain something like that or should it be done regionally?  We need something permanently accessible.  Given the increase in the number of tourists who seek out something that is distinctively Irish, there might be potential in that regard.<\/p><p> Ms Allen spoke about going to Milan.  Hazel Greene, the Offaly-based silk scarf designer, won the accessory designer of the year in a competition in Galway which is wonderful.  I understand that she has received commissions for some of her work.  It is great to see all of that success.  Many people are surprised about what is happening with the creative economy.  Are we taking it somewhat for granted because we are so good at it?  Do we really appreciate it enough?  Do our national broadcaster and the other broadcasters give it sufficient focus?  Does it have to be part of a specialist programme or, if there is a great success in an international competition, should that not feature as part of the mainstream news to allow people to appreciate what we have as a nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#EE00500","speaker":"1099","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429619700,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The Cathaoirleach has raised some valid points.  In one of my former roles with the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, I worked directly with some of the career guidance agencies.  From a local enterprise office understanding and from a designer's, craftsperson's or artist's perspective there is a challenge in terms of understanding what the job is.  Young designers presenting themselves do not necessarily see themselves as entrepreneurs.  Equally a local enterprise office will not necessarily see them as potentially being the next business it wants to be able to support.  We need to put that infrastructure in place.<\/p><p>The Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has launched a number of initiatives and we are actively working with the local enterprise offices.  We have set up a design mentoring panel to give advice to young and emerging craft enterprises.  We have realised that just as the designers need an education, the agencies also need an education.  We will actively work with them to deliver workshops regionally.  We have set up an initiative, called Fuse, that brings a number of experts in retail, design, innovation and PR into a space with a group of designers to work intensively with them to understand what those young creative individuals need in terms of support.  That is followed on by one-to-one mentoring, much of which is supported through a partnership between local enterprise offices, and Irish Design 2015 and the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The role of arts officers in supporting the designers is very important.  I was an arts officer for a brief period and I know it is a very demanding role.  More to the point, there is a gap.  There could be a role for a similar person in the design field - a design officer or a craft and design officer in the local authority who could potentially deliver a dedicated support service.  If we try to give too much work to arts officers, they might not be able to deliver.<br\/><br\/>On spaces for creative individuals, the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland is looking at creating centres of excellence for fashion and textiles, and ceramics.  There is a benefit in terms of supporting the emergence of workspaces for creatives.  We need to look at the model.  I know a number of local enterprise offices have supported those in the past.  Not all of them have been successful and some have been extremely successful.  We need to look at the levels of investment and how we bring creatives and companies forward, looking at those economies of scale and how those enterprises can scale.  We need to come together and develop a number of strategies in partnership.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman asked if we appreciate the creative economy enough and if we take it for granted.  We work in partnership with the media.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and RTE are very strong partners particularly for Irish Design 2015.  It is very important to celebrate our wins.  It would be great to have a slot that celebrates Irish design in Milan, for example, on the national news.  We need to become more aware of the contribution not only to the economy but also from a cultural perspective of how Ireland is perceived abroad.  The level and depth of culture that we hold intrinsically in ourselves without even knowing it is something we should celebrate more fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015042100002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429619700,"counter":99,"content":"<p>That concludes our engagement.

I am accompanied by Ms Rosemary Steen, director of public affairs; Mr. John Fitzgerald, director of grid development; and Mr. Aidan Geoghegan, project manager on the North-South interconnector project.<\/p> <p>  Last month we published a draft strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s transmission grid.  The draft strategy, on which EirGrid is now seeking public feedback, is shaped by three key pillars, namely, open engagement with communities, making the most of new technologies and a commitment to make the existing grid work harder before building new transmission infrastructure.  The strategy takes account of the changing technical and economic context for Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission system, examines the energy challenges facing Ireland and identifies the steps we need to take to develop a strong and secure transmission system for homes, farms and businesses throughout Ireland in order that the electricity grid is capable of providing for the energy needs of our country now and into the future.<\/p> <p>  The strategic review includes an independent report from Indecon which shows that investment in the electricity grid will directly benefit Ireland&rsquo;s economy and can help reduce energy costs.  As well as supporting indigenous businesses and consumers, a modern transmission grid will put Ireland in a strong position to continue to attract foreign investment and support new and emerging opportunities in the energy sector.  This approach will also support Ireland&rsquo;s current policy objectives, including the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and the IDA&rsquo;s regional development strategy.  The draft strategy reflects the change in economic circumstances and our current circumstances as a country, an economy and a society.  In recent years we have seen technological advances, some of which we have deployed already to great effect and others which are now emerging.  Based on all these advances, our new strategy is firmly focused on maximising existing assets and deploying appropriate advanced technology solutions.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the North-South interconnector, the review determined that there remains a clear need for the project and that a 400 kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution.  The interconnector is a 400 kV overhead line linking a substation in Woodland, County Meath, with a new substation in Turleenan, County Tyrone.  It will provide a second high capacity transmission line between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The project will more than double the power transfer capacity between North and South, thereby improving the efficiency of the all-island electricity market.<\/p><p>It will enhance the security of the electricity supply throughout the island of Ireland, which is essential for economic growth, the creation of jobs and improving the standard of living and quality of life for all.  In addition, it will enable more renewable energy supplies to be connected to the network, thereby reducing our production of greenhouse gasses and our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  The interconnector is needed now, as a cross-Border bottleneck has developed on the all-island electricity system, which is having serious financial consequences.  Last year the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reported that the North-South interconnector would remove the bottleneck and reduce electricity costs by &euro;30 million per year.<br\/><br\/>The proposed scheme has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate for some time, with the focus on whether it can be put underground.  Several independent reports on the issue have been published.  In 2008 the Government commissioned the Dutch energy consultancy company Ecofys to produce a Study on the Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines Versus Underground Cables.  In 2009 EirGrid published a report produced by industry experts, PB Power, which examined overhead and underground options for the project.  A key component of the study was a comprehensive and site-specific underground cable evaluation that identified and evaluated a specific route corridor.  The report was reviewed and updated in 2013.  Another report commissioned by EirGrid was a technical study by TransGrid Solutions of Canada that investigated the impact of high voltage, direct current, HVDC, schemes in the Irish transmission network.  We also commissioned an assessment by Tokyo Electric Power Company of the technical issues related to significant amounts of underground cable in the all-island transmission system.  In 2012 the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published a study by an international expert commission which had reported on the case for, and cost of, undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  The Government-appointed independent panel, headed by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, acknowledged that the evaluation of undergrounding of the North-South interconnector was compatible with the methodologies being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects.<br\/><br\/>We do not have time to examine in detail the findings of all these reports, but there are two themes that emerge from them, the most prominent of which is the finding that undergrounding the project would be more expensive.  The international expert commission's report concluded that an underground solution would be three times more expensive than an overhead option.  Our own estimate is that an underground system would cost in excess of &euro;500 million more than the overhead option.  As a State-owned company the mission of which is to develop, maintain and operate a secure, economical and efficient transmission system, this is an additional cost EirGrid cannot pass on to consumers.  It is an additional cost that would not be acceptable to the regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  This is made clear in a joint letter to EirGrid in 2013 from the CER and the utility regulator in Northern Ireland which stated:<blockquote>[T]he project must not only be progressed quickly but also cost effectively.  The Committee understands from the Irish Government review that the cost for the undergrounding of the project would be significantly higher than the AC overhead line construction employed elsewhere in Europe.  The regulatory authorities would therefore be of the view that customers should not be expected to pay for any unnecessary costs associated with undergrounding of the cables given there would be no enhancement in service. <\/blockquote>I will deal briefly with some of the technical aspects of the project.  In its 2012 report the international expert commission made only one recommendation, namely, that the North-South interconnector not be undergrounded using AC technology.  We agree with that recommendation.  The commission, while not recommending that the interconnector be undergrounded, stated that if it were to be undergrounded for all or a significant portion of its length, the best solution would be to use HVDC technology.  EirGrid is very familiar with HVDC and keeps abreast of the development and application of the technology which we successfully deployed in our east-west interconnector project.  However, while it was, in fact, the only technically feasible option available for the east-west interconnector, the same cannot be said for the North-South interconnector project.  There are technical options to be considered and they have been. <br\/><br\/>The international expert commission found that AC overhead line technology was the standard in Europe for implementing projects similar in application to the North-South interconnector.  That remains the position.  There are significant technical issues with putting projects such as the North-South interconnector underground using HVDC technology.<\/p><p>One of the key benefits of the North-South interconnector is the ability to operate the networks North and South as if they were one system.  This will bring cost savings for electricity consumers as a larger electricity system can be operated more efficiently than smaller ones.  However, if the project was to be put underground, it would be an HVDC system linking two alternating current or AC networks.  As HVDC is not compatible with AC, there would be additional complexities as it would require equipment to convert the power from AC to HVDC and back again.  In order to function properly, an HVDC interconnector would also require a computerised control system.  Such a system would be bespoke and very complex and introduce a risk of mal-operation.  Taking such a risk when there is a technically superior and less risky option readily available is unnecessary.  In addition, \"tapping\" into an HVDC interconnector at an intermediate point to provide a new grid connection or for network reinforcement in the future would add to the already complex control system.  It would also be significantly more costly, potentially in excess of &euro;100 million more, than tapping into the proposed AC overhead line.  This would disadvantage future development in the region.<\/p><p> Where are we with the project?  EirGrid has recently republished its proposed line route that will form the basis of an application for planning approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The review resulted in the proposed tower locations being repositioned along the alignment.  The alignment has not changed and the owners of the land holdings affected were notified prior to publication.  We are looking to submit a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming weeks.  In fact, we have been liaising with the board on the planning application for some months.  We have been doing this because 18 months ago the European Commission designated the interconnector a project of common interest, PCI.  This is a significant development and means that the project is subject to a new EU regulation for trans-European energy infrastructure that is designed to facilitate a more efficient permit granting process.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was designated as the competent authority for managing the PCI process in Ireland and, as per the EU regulation, we submitted a draft application file to it for review.  Last month we submitted additional information to the board which it is reviewing.  Once it is satisfied with the draft application, it will draw up a schedule for formally submitting the planning application.  We expect this to happen very soon. <\/p><p> As I mentioned, open engagement with communities is a key pillar of the draft strategy.  During the course of the project we have endeavoured to meet every landowner affected by the development and have had productive discussions with many.  Others have chosen not to deal with us directly, appointing intermediaries to represent them.  This is their undoubted right and prerogative.  However, it is also a barrier to effective engagement and we encourage all landowners to talk to us.<\/p><p> Recently we have opened offices in counties Meath and Monaghan and will shortly open a new office in Cavan.  We are encouraging anyone interested in the project to call in and discuss it with our project team.  These offices will remain open right through to the submission of the planning application and afterwards.  Our staff will be on hand in the local offices to provide assistance for landowners and members of the public who wish to make a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la once the statutory consultation process starts following the submission of the planning application.<\/p><p> The interconnector is critical to ensuring a safe, secure supply of electricity throughout the island of Ireland.  It will bring major cost savings and address significant issues around security of electricity supply, particularly in Northern Ireland.  On behalf of the EirGrid representatives present, I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to brief it on this critical development.

The Chairman has mentioned that different solutions are appropriate for different projects.  There is no one bespoke solution that works for all projects.  I will talk about them in turn, indicating the differences between them.  I will deal, first, with the North-South project which is at a significantly more advanced stage than both the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  It has been the subject of extensive analysis and consultation for a number of years.  A number of reports have examined the undergrounding of the interconnector.  In 2009 EirGrid commissioned PV Power to produce a detailed report which was published.  It included a route specific evaluation of the underground option.  The analysis was updated in 2013 and made available.  In addition, in 2011 the Government appointed a commission of three international experts to look specifically at the project.  Its terms of reference included an examination of the cost of, and the case for, undergrounding the interconnector.  The commission reported in 2012.  At the time its members appeared before the committee to brief members on their findings.  The underground option has, therefore, been analysed extensively.<\/p> <p>  The independent expert panel was established at the start of 2014 by the then Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  It is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and includes Professor Colm McCarthy, Professor John Fitzgerald, Professor Keith Bell and Dr. Karen Foley.  It was asked to examine the analysis and assessment of the different technical options, specifically the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector, and come to a view on whether the analysis was the same as that being proposed for the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  It concluded that it was.  Therefore, the same rigour and analysis has been applied to the alternatives, in particular, the undergrounding option for the North-South project.<\/p> <p>  I will address the question of the new advanced technology that has been potentially deployed for the Grid Link project and the extent to which it may or may not be applicable to other projects.  It is a technology that relies on upgrading the existing grid; therefore, the Grid Link project is about transmitting large power supplies effectively from the Munster region to Leinster and, in particular, the east coast centred around Dublin where there has been and continues to be significant growth in demand.  However, there is a multiplicity of transmission lines between Munster and Leinster.  The new technology which has not been deployed anywhere else for this purpose in Europe before relies on maximising the utilisation of these lines.<\/p> <p>  In the case of the North-South project, it is about joining two transmission grids - the grid in the Republic and the grid in Northern Ireland.  There is a single link between the two.  While we have two transmission grids, there is a single all-island energy market.  To have the infrastructure underneath to support that single energy market, it is necessary to reinforce it.  Unfortunately,there is only one link and we do not have a multiplicity of lines, the use of which we could maximise.  Therefore, new infrastructure is needed.<\/p><p>That technology is not appropriate, which means the main technical option for the North-South interconnector is an underground solution using HVDC technology.  As I pointed out, this technology has been the subject of extensive reviews.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about the other two major projects.  As part of the Grid West project, EirGrid examined overhead and underground options.  We established that by reducing the voltage from 400 kV to 220 kV, we could potentially underground up to 30 km of the circuit.  We identified and analysed this option.  The analysis of the three options was conducted in line with the terms of reference established and set out by the independent expert panel.  The analysis has been submitted to the panel which is in the process of reviewing it.  Once the review has been concluded, the panel will provide an opinion to the Minister as to whether the analysis meets the terms of reference and the options are set out in an objective and comparable manner.  EirGrid will then publish the detailed analysis that has been submitted to the independent expert panel and engage with local communities in the area in an extended project specific consultation on the three options.<\/p><p> Grid Link has always been approximately six months behind Grid West in terms of project development.  In addition to an overhead option, which is the one on which we have been engaging with communities and for which we have identified multiple line routes, we are in the process of developing an underground cable route.  This would be a direct point-to-point route from Cork to Kildare rather than a three-point solution, as is the case with the overhead line.  As part of the Grid25 review, which we have been carrying out for the past year, we identified this new technology which is deployed in other parts of the world.  For example, it is deployed in the United States on very long transmission lines that are hundreds of kilometres in length to enable them to be used effectively.  EirGrid has established that in the context of a relatively small system such as the system in Ireland, the technology can be used for a different purpose on existing lines to maximise the power throughput on them.  This is another option in respect of these lines. <\/p><p> EirGrid will develop these options in further detail.  They are clearly very different across a range of criteria in terms of their impact on the environment, both visual and natural, cost implications and technical characteristics.  They all meet the needs of the regional economy for the next decade or until 2030.  We have stress-tested them specifically against the IDA's regional development strategy and the plans for the region in terms of existing industries and their anticipated development over the relevant period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>How influential will the public consultation be, for instance, if, in the case of Grid West, the overwhelming traction, if one likes, is in favour of upgrading the two 20 kV lines and undergrounding 30 km of the route to avoid schools and other pressure points?

Central to this was a set of 12 commitments as to how we would improve our consultation and engagement in the future.

We are quite clear that we are going into the Grid West project with three options.  We have not decided which one and we do not have a predisposition towards one or the other.  We have the independent expert panel to ensure that as we analyse the options and present the analysis of the options to the public, this is done in a fair, transparent and comparable way in order that people can see the trade-offs that are being made or that need to be made when a selection is being made from options.

It seems that the company has done a U-turn with regard to the Grid West and the Grid Link south.  When it is good enough for Grid West and Grid Link south, why is it not good enough for the people in the path of the North-South interconnector?  There is significant disquiet in this regard.  There is also significant scepticism with regard to the consultation process.  As I stated, I think it was a decision made by the company to take the energy from one point to the other without any consultation with the people on its path and this has led to the almost stand-off situation at this stage.  Is it fair and equitable for the company to drive on with the proposal on the North-South interconnector?  The company has explained all the technical issues but the fundamental point is that this project will have a detrimental effect on the area in its path.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two and a half years there has been discussion in this committee and in the D&aacute;il about the cost.  The undergrounding of the project was going to be three times more expensive.  In December 2013 the figure was bandied about that it would be six times the cost of the overgrounding.  This report gives the figure as being 1.57 times the cost.  Why is there such a variation in the figures?  How come the figure of six times the cost has been reduced to 1.57 times the cost?<\/p><p>Where was the figure of six times the cost found?  What is the cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector?  There is a fear among people on the path of the interconnector that, regardless of consultation with the communities, the offices opened or the engagement, the decisions have been made, the routes are planned and the plan will go ahead.  Why will EirGrid not consider undergrounding the interconnector?  What is the real rationale behind that decision?  The information, technology, knowledge and issues around putting the entire North-South interconnector could be as wrong now as the figures were a year and a half ago.<\/p><p> The communities are very aggrieved and feel strongly that the consultation is a whitewash, is only ticking a box and will not make any real difference to the overall strategy that EirGrid will announce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#H00300","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>There have been several detailed analyses of undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  In 2009, we published a detailed, route-specific analysis of undergrounding by the international company, PB Power.  That was updated in 2013.  The Government appointed an international expert commission of three who examined the case for and cost of undergrounding it.  The independent expert panel appointed by the Minister concluded that in all material respects undergrounding had been examined to the same extent and level of detail as was being proposed for the Grid Link and Grid West projects.  All of that analysis has been done for the North-South project.  It has been publicly available and has been debated publicly, including with this committee.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the multiples of the cost as being 1.57 versus six times.  I take it the 1.57 is from the comparison of options for Grid Link in the recent strategy.  For different projects different technology solutions are appropriate and they require different capacities of interconnector.  For Grid Link the proposed underground scheme is 700 MW, but for North-South a 1,500 MW scheme is needed.  Therefore, the comparison is not like for like.  The 1.57 is based on a 700 MW scheme for the Grid Link project.  There is still a band around that &euro;800 million to &euro;850 million as we are still involved in the engineering and detailed design of that.  With the delivery of the east-west interconnector, we have a lot of experience of the costing, engineering and delivery of these high voltage direct current, HVDC, projects.<\/p><p>The higher cost multiple comes from our detailed engineering analysis of delivering an underground solution for a North-South connector and from the PV power report where the multiple was approximately five.  That is based on a detailed engineering analysis, component by component and route specific, which is all documented and set out in the PV power report, which was updated in 2013.<\/p><p> The other number often cited is a multiple of three.  This comes from the international expert commission appointed by the Government.  That multiple was not derived through an on-site engineering study, but through comparison with a range of projects around Europe.  The commission carried out an international benchmarking exercise - some of the commission worked closely on those projects and I expect it was good information - and its conclusion was a factor of three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The figure of six times the cost was bandied about prior to a D&aacute;il debate we had in 2013 regarding the North-South interconnector.

This is a very contentious issue and there are different aspects which cause concern for people.  Everybody agrees that in this country we need secure, affordable and sustainable energy supplies.  Everybody is conscious of that but how can we get there in an economic way and in a manner that respects people's lives and ways of living?  How we can we do it in a way to deliver the benefits we are seeking?  There are a few components to consider.<\/p> <p>  The witness mentioned the technological advances that have been made since the last proposals were put forward, particularly in terms of Grid West and Grid Link.  I am unclear about the financial impact of those as there seems to be some contradictory information in the material that we have.  If I read this correctly, the projected cost of &euro;3.2 billion in 2011 will now range from &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.9 billion in 2015.  Another document indicates that there is the option to use existing infrastructure, at least in part, for Grid West and Grid Link, so I would have expected a big reduction in the cost.  Undergrounding is argued to be three times more expensive for the North-South interconnector but people still have serious doubts about that figure.  It is moving around the place.<\/p> <p>  People will not be reassured by the witness stating that the project is of common interest.  Basically, the indication is this can be fast-tracked through the planning system.  There was mention of consultation with the community.<\/p><p>Design documents are being drawn up to support planning applications.  As that costs money, it means effectively that decisions have been made.  It is difficult to know what difference public consultations can make as the design decisions have been made.  Otherwise, EirGrid would not be in a position to produce design documents for planning applications.  Am I wrong in saying this?<\/p><p> EirGrid referred to series compensation technology, which will allow existing infrastructure to be used, but dismisses it for the North-South interconnector project.  As I am not technically knowledgeable enough and do not have technical staff who could advise me on why this must be the case, will the delegation explain to me in simple English why it is that series compensation technology can be used elsewhere but not for the North-South interconnector project?<\/p><p> Several times during the presentation it was mentioned that too much of a burden must not be placed on communities.  I agree completely, but the burden seems to be in terms of energy bills only.  While this is important, there are other impacts such as on house and home values, agriculture and those involved in the tourism industry.  Has any analysis been carried out of these aspects?  I would have expected one to have been carried out.<\/p><p> There has been a difference in approach between the North-South interconnector project and projects in the rest of the country.  Will this have an impact on future discussions or proposals for an interconnector project with Britain or France?  If there is to be wider interconnectivity between continental Europe, Britain and Ireland which is not beyond the bounds of possibility, will the same restrictions apply to such a proposal?<\/p><p> Nowhere in the documentation is the impact of further delays in the North-South interconnector project addressed.  There have been many delay in the project up to now.  I do not see any evidence that progress has been made in getting those who will be immediately impacted on, namely, the host communities whose lands and lives will be impacted on by the interconnector, to understand or to at least accept that this is the way this needs to be done.  The fact that they do not understand or accept this means that some people will resist the project in every legal way they can, despite the object of common interest designation, allowing it to be fast-tracked through the planning system.  What will be the impact if there are further delays?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#L01200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on technological advances and the financial implications.<\/p><p>The Deputy said that he would have expected to see a drop in the &euro;3.2 billion number, which was the estimate of the cost of the Grid25 review in 2011.  As he will have seen from the recently published draft strategy, there is a range from &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.9 billion in terms of the cost.<\/p><p> On a like-for-like comparison basis - in the original 2008 strategy we had assumed an overhead line solution to a project and we assume that is how we would now deliver all the projects - there is a significant drop in the overall costs, which is the &euro;2.7 billion number.  Therefore, the figure of &euro;3.2 billion on a like-for-like comparison basis comes down to &euro;2.7 billion.  However, in addition to that, we have become more open to other technologies and that includes advanced technologies such as series compensation, which I will talk about later, and also underground technologies.  Hence, we have published a range for the total cost because, for many projects, the decision about whether it will be overhead or underground has not been taken and that decision, on a project by project basis, would impact on the cost.  If we took the decision to underground a project, it would increase the cost.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct in that some of the new technologies we are deploying are more cost-effective.  Some of them are more expensive but have other advantages such as undergrounding and, hence, the range in the figures.  We moved from a point estimate, which we would have used in the original strategy, to a range in this respect.  We have not picked a solution for many of the linear projects and therefore there is a range in the cost depending on the technology choice.  However, there is a significant scaling back.  The original number was &euro;4 billion in 2008, the number was &euro;3.2 billion in 2011, which is the number that the Deputy selected, and now the number is down to &euro;2.7 billion if one were to a like-for-like comparison.  That reflects the stark change in economic projections and also projections around use of electricity.  That was the Deputy's first question.<\/p><p> The Deputy's second question, if I picked him up right, was around the multiple of costs for undergrounding the North-South project.  He referenced the three times cost.  That is not a number we produced but one that was produced by the international expert commission, which was appointed by the Government and reported in 2012.  It was its conclusion that deploying a HVDC underground solution in respect of the North-South project would be three times the cost.  Our detailed engineering analysis comes up with a higher number than that and that was the subject of the discussion that I had with Deputy Moynihan.  I am aware that the three times number has been questioned but it is important to make sure when making comparisons to ensure they are like for like comparison of projects.  The three times number is not ours it is that of the international expert commission.<\/p><p> The Deputy picked up on the project of common interest, PCI, point that I made during my opening remarks and the issue of it being a fast-track process.  The PCI process is a European one that was introduced for what are labelled projects of common interest and they extend across different infrastructural types.  Typically they are cross-Broder projects.  The North-South interconnector has been designated a project of common interest.  The enabling framework within the Irish planning system to give effect to that was put in place late last year and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was appointed as the competent authority for managing projects of common interest.  There is a slightly different process for projects of common interest to the process that would apply for a project such as a substation in Mayo.  One of the key ways it is different is  with respect to the process before application.<\/p><p>It sets out what is required of the developer in terms of their engagement with localities and communities.  As a result of the designation of North-South, and these regulations came into force in the middle of the North-South project although it had a life before the end of last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the competent authority, had to examine the project and the consultation and engagement that had been done and determine whether it met the requirements for consultation and engagement as set out in the projects of common interest, PCI, regulations.  That is called the concept of public participation, which we had to produce around that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la reviewed that and agreed that we could move forward based on the consultation that had been done.<\/p><p> The other difference is that under the normal planning rules, the developer submits a planning application, and there is fairly limited engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la before that.  Under the PCI process a draft application is provided to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which it reviews, and it must certify that it is fit for purpose before it is submitted as a formal application.  We have been engaged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that since November or December last year when we submitted the draft application.  That is quite a different process.  Once it has determined that the material is fit for purpose it then sets out the schedule of the process involved in lodging the application.  That is everything from site notices to notification of statutory bodies to notices in newspapers, etc.  It sets out that process, and we understand it will take about four weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>If I may intervene, was that process ongoing during the preparation of this study?

It has a series of consultations on it in which everyone has an opportunity to have their say.  An oral hearing is conducted.  My understanding of it is that it is not significantly different in terms of what the process looks like from the point of application forward.  That is it in terms of the PCI process.<\/p> <p>  The next point I picked up was on the new advanced technology we are deploying on the Grid Link as an option, alongside the overhead solution and the underground solution in terms of series compensation technology and why that is not applicable to the north-south project.  I would say it is also not applicable to the Grid West project.  I will attempt to explain and if I do not do so adequately, members can feel free to interrupt me.  It is technology that is deployed on existing transmission lines in existing transmission stations.<\/p><p>It is large transmission kit such as one would see in a transmission station.  It is put on the ends of a transmission line and it changes the electrical characteristics of that transmission line and allows more power to be pushed over the line than would happen in the absence of this technology.  When this technology is put in, it allows the maximisation of the power transfer over the existing transmission line.  Advanced control systems now allow the possibility to change how that happens from the control centre as well.<\/p><p> In the case of Grid Link, that works because we have a need to move large amounts of power from the south and south west, where generation is growing in the Cork-Kerry area, up towards the east, centred around Dublin where there is demand growth.  That is one of the key parts of the Grid Link project.  There is a multiplicity of existing transmission lines which run from the general south and south east area to the Dublin area.  The existing transmission network covering that is a mesh network.  Therefore, existing transmission lines are in place upon which we can place this technology to maximise use.  If that multiplicity of lines can currently carry 100 units of power, by deploying this technology we can raise that to, say, 110 or 120 units of power.  <\/p><p> We need to do two other things as well to solve the Grid Link issue.  One is to up-rate seven or eight existing lines in the Golden Vale south east region, which we can do.  That involves upgrading and changing conductors on the lines in existing infrastructure to allow them to carry more power.  The second thing we need to do is to install another cable underneath the River Shannon.  We are trying to get power which is being generated in the Cork-Kerry area out so we need to get it underneath the Shannon and onto the 400 kV lines, where we are going to deploy this technology, and maximise the use of those 400 kV lines, which start at Moneypoint station and travel up towards Dublin. <\/p><p> That is why it works in the case of Grid Link.  It does not work in the case of North-South or Grid West because the problem is a different one  In the case of North-South, the problem is that there are two different transmission grids.  We have a single, all-island energy market but two transmission grids with, currently, one link between them.  We need to enable the two grids to be operated more seamlessly together to maximise the benefits of the all-island market.  To do that, we need to put in place another piece of infrastructure alongside the existing one.  We do not have the underlying network to utilise; it needs new infrastructure.  Hence, the technical options boil down to an overhead option or an underground option to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Is it the case, therefore, that there is no converter or receiver to receive the transmission in one format and convert it like one would with a modem in communications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#P00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Not without the circuit in between.  In order to transmit electricity, we need a circuit in between.  The technologies to do that are either underground or overhead technologies.  If we go underground, we need the large converter stations at either end, because the underground technology uses a different power transmission technology.  It uses high-voltage, direct current, HVDC, technology.  All of the grid, all of the material in this room, everything we have, uses AC technology.  We therefore need these converter stations to convert the power from AC to DC and back again.  When we talk about converter stations, that is what that is.  The HVDC cable is completely underground, but we have these converter stations at either end to convert them in and out.  Hence, there is no existing network on which to deploy the technology to which I referred for Grid Link series compensation to maximise the usage of it.  It is a case of needing additional infrastructure and examining what are the options for it.  I hope I have managed to explain that.<\/p><p> The Deputy's next question, if I understood him correctly, was on the analysis of other impacts besides just the economic impact on energy prices.

Will he clarify that point?<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, there is an intention to provide an interconnector between France and Ireland in due course.  Looking to the long term, does it make sense to go around the country installing pylons and wind turbines when the probability is that in ten to 15 years time we will not be able to produce electricity more cheaply than the price at which it can be imported?  In England, for example, they have kicked the wind turbines to touch and given a contract to the French to build five plants.  In Mr. Slye's opinion, is the most likely scenario one in which it will be cheaper to import electricity than to produce it here?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slye referred to working with IDA Ireland in the regions.  That must be a recent development because everything that organisation has been doing has been focused on Dublin.  It is not in the past three, four or ten years that consideration has been given to the regions.<\/p> <p>  Investment in motorway infrastructure in recent years has left us with a good network.  By and large, that development managed to avoid, as much as possible, impacting on home owners.  In deciding the location of pylons and other infrastructure why does EirGrid not seem to give the same consideration to avoiding building near people's houses?  Why has it not worked in conjunction with the National Roads Authority in devising these projects rather than imposing a blight on the landscape in all parts of Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Colreavy and Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the impact of this infrastructure on property prices.  Has EirGrid undertaken any analysis of the extent to which the homes of people living 50 m or 100 m from these unsightly pylons will be devalued?  The delegates have indicated that they took account of the impact on tourism and referred to community grants, which seems to be the buzz phrase.  Community grants are being talked about like the pill the doctor will give to the patient to make him or her better.  However, ordinary people, many of whom are in negative equity, are understandably concerned about the impact of pylons and turbines on the valuation of their property.  We have seen how much the technology has advanced in the past six months throughout Europe and the world in dealing with cryptosporidium and other types of water pollution.  I am sure that if similar progress is made in the case of electricity infrastructure, networking could become a very efficient and cost-effective way to go.<\/p><p>Has Mr. Slye looked at the cost base analysis given that more people are working, be it digging or whatever, and more tax is returned to the Exchequer and it may be a better option for everyone's sake?  I ask Mr. Slye to address particularly the issue of England and France.  Are we going down a road where there will be wires and pylons all over the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#T00400","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I might start with the questions on the interconnector.  As the committee will be aware, in 2012 we completed the east-west interconnector, a 500 MW link to Wales from Ireland, which has been in commercial operation since then.  We are investigating further interconnection.  That is part of our overall remit and mandate.  The one that is most advanced that we are looking at is an interconnector to France.  We are working with our colleagues the French transmission system operator, RTE, on evaluating that.  We have done an initial analysis of it to see whether it stacks up from an economic perspective and it does.  It appears to work and we have commissioned a seabed survey which will take place over two years.  The first half took place last summer, the second half will be completed this summer.  That largely informs the cost of building it.  Once one knows what is on the seabed one can better estimate the cost.  This will lead us to a detailed rigorous cost benefit analysis of that project in the first half of next year with a decision as to whether, at that point, to bring it to the next stage of development in association with the French.<\/p> <p>  In terms of interconnectors and their effect on electricity prices and electricity flows I will look first at the east-west interconnector.  About nine months after it was in operation at the end of the first calendar year, we conducted a retrospective analysis as to effect on electricity prices.  We found that the existence of the interconnector and the ability to move power over it had reduced wholesale electricity prices by 9% from what they would have been had the interconnector not been in place.  That was due largely to power moving from the UK into Ireland.  The typical profile of the interconnector for a large part of the time since it has come into operation is that cheaper power comes from the UK into Ireland; its cheaper base load power being nuclear gas traded over the interconnector and into Ireland brings down wholesale prices.  When it is very windy in Ireland the flow tends to go the other way as we have a surplus and sell that excess energy to the UK. <\/p> <p>  In looking at an interconnector with France, obviously for it to go ahead it would have to be a 50-50 joint venture with the French.  It needs to work both overall but also for each country individually.  It needs to make sense for Irish consumers to make an investment of that level in an interconnector.  In looking at the cost benefit analysis of the interconnector we have to ensure it stacks up overall.  The French will look at it from a French perspective and we will look at it from an Irish perspective.   In broad terms the way it pans out, similar to the UK interconnector to an extent, is that at times of relatively low renewable generation across Ireland and the UK, French based nuclear power which is largely nucular would flow into Ireland and have the effect of depressing electricity prices at a wholesale level.  At times when it was relatively windy, the flow of large amounts of renewable resources on these islands reverse and be sold into the UK.  Obviously, that is a very broad generalisation of what would happen on those interconnectors over time.  The French electricity system is quite different from that of the UK electricity system hence the diversity in the two sources works quite well.<\/p><p>The French electricity system is dominated by nuclear power, which has a relatively low incremental cost of production.  It is also relatively inflexible, so that works in terms of interconnecting and getting cheap electricity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Slye nail this for me please because we are going around in circles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#V00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>In business one has to project for the future.

The case for interconnection will have to stand on its own.  It is a single investment in a single piece of infrastructure and it is a big price-tag.<\/p> <p>  The other part of the Deputy's question concerns energy policy.  With the 40% target, for example, and that level of renewable generation, what will be the impact upon electricity prices in, say, ten years' time?  A detailed analysis of that has been done.  It is currently being finalised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We provided some modelling expertise for it.  The SEAI, ourselves and one other party were involved.  They are finalising that study and, as I understand it, they hope to publish it soon.  That specifically examines the question the Deputy is getting at in terms of going to the 2020 target of 40% renewables in electricity and the net costs and benefits, versus a system that, for example, keeps today's levels, which are about 20%.  That study gets to the heart of the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>It has not yet been published, although I understand it is being finalised.<\/p><p> Interconnectors tend to increase the value of the renewable resource because at times of high wind and low demand when it cannot be used, they provide a market into which one can sell and obtain some value.

This means that the French and Irish sides would have to come together to undertake the analysis.

This reduction reflects the decrease in the underlying projections for electricity demand until 2025 and beyond and the potential to use advanced technology to maximise the use of additional infrastructure.  The range in cost figures is due to the fact that for many of the projects we have not determined what will be the choice of technology.  Therefore, if the more expensive technology is chosen, the figure will move towards the upper end of the range.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked a question about the international expert panel and how the multiple of three in terms of costs related to EirGrid's higher projected costs for the North-South interconnector.  The reason the panel and EirGrid arrived at different costs was that two methodologies were used to produce the figures.  I do not disagree with the findings of the international panel of experts which benchmarked broadly similar projects and arrived at an estimate of three times the cost of overgrounding.  It used, if one likes, a top-down approach, whereas EirGrid took a bottom-up approach involving an engineering analysis and the identification of a route.  We costed the route and all of the individual components and produced a higher figure for overall costs.  The difference in the two figures can be attributed to the methodology and approaches employed.  I hope that explains the difference. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about working with the National Roads Authority.  When EirGrid is examining the options for routing overhead transmission lines or underground cables, we consider how best to route them.  For example, the underground cable for the east-west interconnector, a 500 MW interconnector, uses existing roads from Rush beach to Woodlands station.  Typically, it is better to use second class roads than motorways because they do not need to be closed and the works can be accommodated.<\/p> <p>  For the North-South interconnector, the best option we identified was to use agricultural land owing to a much larger land use requirement for the project.  We work with the National Roads Authority and examine options alongside motorways.  However, the routing principles for transport infrastructure along motorways tend to be different from those for transmission lines.  We consider all of these issues.  The key factor is that when one is examining routes for an overhead transmission line, one is trying to mitigate the visual impact and the proximity to houses and community facilities.  In Ireland there is a large number of one-off houses and we try to keep as far away from them as possible when routing a transmission line.  While EirGrid works with local authorities and the NRA on routing, placement alongside roads is not always a viable option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The next speakers are Senator Brennan, Deputy Conlan, Deputy Smith and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.

I am trying to compare the North-South interconnector with the east-west interconnector and with the interconnector to France.  It all depends on the distance and the length of the cable to Wales.  I suggest that the North-South interconnector should be a maximum length of 400 kV underground cable and overhead where it is less conspicuous and then back underground.

Along with other Deputies here I represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  The communities in Cavan-Monaghan are very concerned that they have not been treated in the same fair and equitable manner as people in Grid Link and Grid West.  There is a fundamental difference in the way they have been treated in terms of consultation compared with the people in the west and south.  We are coming to the commemoration of the 1916 centenary.  There is a concept of cherishing all the children of the nation equally but we do not feel that we have been treated equally with people in other parts of the country.  I asked the landowners of County Monaghan to sign a petition to the Minister, Deputy Alex White before the committee meeting of 31 March.  Some 95% of the landowners affected are opposed to overgrounding.  They want a specific underground route option and they want to be consulted on it.  Some 350 fifty people attended a meeting last night in Aughnamullen community centre and they are all totally opposed to the overgrounding of this project.  There is huge community disquiet about the approach taken by EirGrid.<\/p> <p>  On the point made by Mr. Slye about regional gain, there is absolutely no regional gain in Cavan or Monaghan from this project because the company has not included any converter stations.  The previous application included converter stations at Kingscourt but there are no converter stations planned as part of this application so therefore there can be no community gain nor regional gain in the area affected by the project.<\/p> <p>  The company has pointed out here for the first time that it is technically feasible to put this project underground for the length of the line and that is welcome.  The company has said that it will take &euro;500 million more to put it underground than the cost for overground.  A number of questions were asked at last night's meeting about the fact that the valuation of property has not been included in the cost of the overground option when compared with the underground option.  There is also the question of the effect on tourism in the region if the lines are overground.  A number of technical questions were asked and I have some technical questions which I wish the company to address.  Mr. Slye said that the project was needed in its current form because of bottlenecks between transfer of energy between the North and South.  It is my understanding that the daily flow of electricity between the North and South is between 150 MW and 170 MW and that based on the company's own figures and safety requirements, the current interconnector can take a capacity of 400 MW per day but only 150 MW to 170 MW is being used at a maximum at tea time while the average is around 100 MW per day.  There are three power stations in Northern Ireland producing up to 2,300 MW of energy per day.<\/p><p>The average daily consumption of energy in Northern Ireland is 1,200 MW to 1,300 MW.  They can produce 2,300 MW per day.  The maximum daily use ever of energy in Northern Ireland was 1,700 MW in December 2010 during the very bad weather.<\/p><p> They say the maximum flow they can take in is 400 MW per day but the daily average, according to the website, is between 150 MW and 170 MW.  I question the need for this project at a 400 kV line.  In EirGrid&rsquo;s technical guide to the project there is no technical analysis whatsoever of a 220 kV underground option which would cost much less than a 400 kV underground option.  It could produce an additional 500 MW per day with a 220 kV line underground.  That would be technically possible and that option should be before the people.  It has not been put before them and that needs to be done before the project goes ahead.  I have communicated this message to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Delegates from the Irish Farmers Association attended the meeting last night and they were unequivocal in saying they believe a 220 kV line is sufficient, given that the three power stations in Northern Ireland have not been closed down and there is new private gas generation contracted to produce an extra 250 MW through traditional sources.<\/p><p> Mr. Slye mentioned the Tobin report.  The independent expert panel chaired by Ms Justice McGuinness did not have access to the Tobin report before it made its analysis.  There is a complete variance between what the Tobin report and PB Power say about the best options.  The Tobin report said the preferred route options were underground along roads.  PB Power said that was the least best option.<\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la was appointed the competent authority for the project of common interest, PCI, element.

The draft review indicated that an underground line would be feasible and Mr. Slye confirmed that here today when he stated it would be technically possible engineering wise.  He also indicated there are other advantages that have to be taken into account, not just the issue of cost.  This is something we have argued with EirGrid over many years.  There are other advantages, some of which can be quantified in euro and cents.  It is about the people who are so dramatically impacted by what is proposed.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slye stated that consumers should not be burdened, given there would be no enhancement of service by taking the underground approach.  He cited the cost of converter stations, AC to DC, at either end and also stated that they cannot \"pass on\" to consumers.  What cannot be passed on, and over what period of time?  We are looking at a project with a suggested life expectancy of 40 years.  Therefore, what are we talking about in terms of the per annum additionality or the two-monthly billing period most of us are subjected to from Electric Ireland?  What additionality are we talking about and over what period of time?  What is the maximum period this could apply to?<\/p> <p>  As somebody who is not impacted immediately, in terms of living in close proximity to the line, I believe the additional cost per consumer would be marginal over a period.  I am quite willing to pay, because I know what my constituents and those in neighbouring counties, not only in this jurisdiction but North of the Border, would have to face.  We must face up to this.  Does Mr. Slye have the figures on that rather than just saying \"we cannot pass it on to consumers\", as if he was particularly concerned about consumers.  I mean no disrespect, but we are all consumers, including the families and individuals who will be dramatically impacted if this presents in close proximity to their homes.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slye's opening remark was that the interconnector is needed now and he stressed the word \"now\".   I do not believe there is any likelihood this will happen any time soon.  We must also recognise there are significantly reduced demand forecasts, right up to 2025 and beyond.  What does he mean by \"needed now\" when those forecasts apply not only in regard to the economy in this State but across the island?  The forecasts in terms of demand are significantly reduced from what would have been believed back before the current more difficult economic climate. <\/p> <p>  EirGrid has engaged with people on a range of issues, such as land valuation, which is a huge concern for land and homeowners.  This is understandable.  The issue of the environmental impact has also been raised and reference has been made to tourism.  However, this is also about the people who live in the area concerned.  Perhaps some of the subtext to the decision not to take another look at the North-South connector is because it does not belong to the traditional tourist destinations, such as the west or the south east.  However, those of us who live in or visit the area are very concerned in terms of the visual impact for the potential market for the development of the north east.<\/p> <p>  I have a range of other concerns, including one everyone dismisses, namely, health.  This is not just about being unwell.  Health is about being well and having a sense of wellness.<\/p><p>I have heard of one instance of a young man, whose mother spoke to me last evening.  They live in immediate proximity to a 36 kV line and they know the facts.  This young man has special needs and is unable to leave the family home and use anything around the periphery of their smallholding because of the continuous crackling from the line.  Even in damp weather conditions, there is also occasional flickering.  There is a noise factor, even with a 38 kV line.  This will be replaced and there is no consideration given to the fact that this young man has a very severe level of autism and all the complicating factors it entails in terms of the health and quality of life of that family.  There has been no care whatever shown in any of the so-called consultations that have taken place.<\/p><p> Time is against me and there is a range of issues I would have liked to raise with the delegation.  The Tobin Consulting Engineers report was mentioned earlier.  Why was the information in that report not presented to the independent expert panel in the consideration of its extended brief?  It was a minuscule responsibility in terms of taking on the North-South interconnector.  It was a number of days after the publication of that report that the content was shown with respect to the width and depth of the channels to accommodate roadside undergrounding.  The PB Power report indicated 20 m to 22 m working swathes but the reality from the Tobin report was that the width is 1.1 m and the depth is 1.35 m.  That is absolutely achievable along the greatest lengths of the regional road infrastructure that serves the counties of Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone.  It is absolutely achievable and there has never been any serious consideration, despite all that EirGrid and its voices have claimed, of the undergrounding approach with respect to the North-South interconnector.  It has not happened and the PB Power report does not tick the box under any circumstances.  There has been no consultation with the people on the ground on this real alternative.  The figures on potential cost have decreased and this will continue.  Some day, EirGrid will wake up and wonder what all the fuss was about and how it should have considered this approach all along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#Z00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I must attend another committee meeting.  I welcome the chief executive's clear statement in response to my party colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, that it is feasible to underground the North-South interconnector project.  I suggest that in advancing the project, EirGrid should consult the local community about undergrounding options.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that has not entered the debate much is that the project is for a relatively short distance interconnector, making it completely different from the western project and the example in the South and midlands.  The technical analysis document states that Grid25 was predicated on forecasted electricity demand at a peak of 8,000 MW daily by 2025.  The forecast is now over 5,000 MW daily, which is the same as the 2011 peak.  Will the witnesses confirm which figures are correct in that respect?<\/p> <p>  I attended the public meeting referred to by Deputies Conlan and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in last night in Aghnamullen, County Monaghan.  More than 400 decent, honourable local people attended that meeting to voice their concerns, anger and their absolute frustration with the inability of EirGrid to have a meaningful consultation to date.  They gave a clear message that they will not be treated as second-class citizens.<\/p><p>Whereas there was a meaningful external panel assessment of the grid projects for the west, the south east and the midlands, the North-South interconnector was an add-on without a meaningful review being undertaken.  It is welcome that two of the other projects were substantially changed in terms of how they would be completed.  Why can it not be the same for the people of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath?<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Colreavy asked about the adverse impact of the interconnector on land values and the devaluation of property.  It certainly beats Banagher to hear Mr. Fitzgerald refer to an international qualitative assessment.  What about the man or woman who milks 40 or 50 cows a day and whose holding, if traversed by these pylons, would be decimated and no longer be in a position to carry on his or her existing farming practices?  One does not need to have any international assessment to know that the real adverse impact of these pylons would be on these individuals, families and communities.  We need to get real in the consultations with people and communities.  When the project was first initiated in 2009, the cost of putting the lines underground was put at 20 times more than that of overgrounding.  Today EirGrid has stated it will be a small multiple of the cost, if at all.  The clear message has to go to EirGrid that the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath want the North-South interconnector project, if it is to proceed, to be put underground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#AA00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>It has been a contentious, topical but necessary discussion for all Deputies and Senators from counties Cavan and Monaghan.

The Deputy is right.  However, a specific underground route was examined and published.  Members who have looked at the back of the PB Power report will see an Ordnance Survey map that sets out the route corridor.<\/p> <p>  The next question was on regional gain on which I will make two points.  First, the existence of a high voltage AC transmission line such as this one affords opportunities to interconnect into it, even without the station being there initially, and a great example of that is Apple in Athenry.  It is not connecting in to an existing station.  We are building a new transmission station for it, tapping in to an existing high voltage transmission line.  The existence of that corridor, therefore, provides access to high quality, high voltage electricity that will allow for developments into the future.  We see that with Apple, and we are seeing it more frequently with other companies that are looking to develop and tap in to an existing line.<\/p> <p>  I would point out also that we have in place a proposal on community gain that includes both a community fund for the wider community and also a proximity allowance payable to householders in recognition of the fact that transmission infrastructure has a greater impact on those immediately adjacent to it in terms of their visual amenity.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of bottlenecks in the current flow of the existing line, power capacity in Northern Ireland and projections for security supply in Northern Ireland.  If I might, I will group those three issues in my answer.  Every year we review the security of supply on the entire island.<\/p><p>We look at it in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and on the island as a whole.  It is updated every year based on best projections for economic growth and electricity demand growth resulting from that.   The document, called the Generation Capacity Statement, is published every year, and it is approved by the regulators North and South before it is published.  That document clearly articulates the security supply issue that is emerging in Northern Ireland in 2020 as security of supply margins dip below what is acceptable.  That is due in part to the impending closure of some of the power stations in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> For those who are not aware, two of the power stations in Northern Ireland use coal and there are European directives around the continued use of those power stations.  A number of power stations closures are imminent in Northern Ireland and they are set out in our report.

The situations outlined by the Deputy in terms of Coolkeeragh, Moyle and all of those issues have been analysed in the generation adequacy report.

He asked why those costs would be passed on to consumers and the impact over the lifetime of the project.  In the context of transmission development, at the end of the day consumers end up paying for the cost of the transmission network.  It is broken down and differentiated depending on the consumer group, with industrial consumers tending to have a greater percentage of their bill relating to transmission charges than domestic customers.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the impact on people's bills, I am aware of one piece of analysis that was done.  The energy regulator reported to this committee that if the transmission infrastructure development bill was to increase by &euro;2 billion through the undergrounding of a series of the major projects, it would raise prices by 3% to 5% at domestic level.  This is on the record of this committee and I may not have it 100% right.  The one point I want to stress is that industrial customers pay significantly more as a percentage of their bills in transmission chargers.  For some of those industrial customers, who are among the largest employers in the country, the additional energy bill in a year could exceed &euro;1 million.  Therefore, 3% to 5% in some contexts might not seem like a large amount of money, but we need to consider the effect on all users of the system and how that affects Ireland's competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#FF01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Over what period of time is that calculated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#FF01500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>A 40-year depreciation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#FF01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1429612200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>May I just ask about the ones that were not answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042100002#FF01700","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429612200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I believe it was consistent with what Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in outlined.
