This is borne out by recent research findings:<\/p><p>- My Department&rsquo;s 'Growing Up in Ireland' study has found how over 24% of 9 to 17 year olds have reported been bullied.<\/p><p>- The Anti-Bullying Centre in Trinity College has found how one in four girls and one in six boys in Ireland have been involved in cyber-bullying either as a victim, bully or both.<\/p><p>- Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp; Lesbian Equality Network) &amp; BeLonG To on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 58% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools.<\/p><p>  Bullying can have a terrible and corrosive impact on our children and young people, on their confidence, learning outcomes, self-esteem and mental health.  The affects of bullying can last for years. Sadly, in some case they can result in the loss of young lives. In recent times we have learned of a number of very tragic cases where bullying was involved. On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I wish extend my sympathies to the families and friends of the young people who have died.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children &amp; Youth Affairs I am committed to working with colleagues in Government to ensure that integrated policy responses to combat bullying are high on our agenda. The new Children First guidelines which I published last year now, for the first time, recognises the problem of bullying.<\/p><p>  Last month Minister Quinn and I launched the Action Plan on Bullying. This is the first plan of its kind and aims to address the serious impact of bullying on our children and young people. The publication of this plan is an important step in the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensuring a safer childhood. <\/p><p>  The Action Plan recognises that as bullying is no longer limited to classrooms, we have to have a broader approach also. That means making sure that wherever young people are, they&rsquo;re protected by safety guidelines. It means making sure that wherever young people are, they are supported by an anti-bullying ethos and an Anti Bullying Framework. <\/p><p>  In line with the Action Plan, my Department will lead the development of Anti Bullying Framework to support young people, parents, schools, teachers and youth worker.<\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying Framework will be development and prioritised within the context of the new whole-of-government Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which my Department is leading on and which is due be published later this year.<\/p><p>  My Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of an anti-bullying website, as recommended in the plan, to provide a single point of access to practical advice for parents, children and teachers to support them in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours, including cyberbullying. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools in tackling bullying and their need for support and guidance, The National Education Welfare Board, which now comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, has issued guidelines requiring each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. Compliance by schools with this NEWB requirement is now inspected by Department of Education Inspectorate during Whole School Evaluations.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, my Department is committed to the fight against bullying and we will work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300070#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300070#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[7334\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300070#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the measures she is taking to support youth employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to creating the environment for a strong economic recovery to support employment creation and jobs growth. Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the difficulties it poses for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include initiatives in respect of education, training, job search assistance\/work experience and support for job creation.   <\/p><p><br \/>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have sought to highlight and promote the potential of youth work as part of the continuum of youth employment supports and I welcome the growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.<\/p><p><br \/>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.<\/p><p><br \/>  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiative can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme. Minister Bruton is currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context my Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the inclusion in the plan of appropriate actions relating to the contribution of the youth sector in supporting youth employment, including through a greater focus on promoting and supporting volunteering opportunities.<\/p><p><br \/>  In line with the Ireland&#8217;s overall EU Presidency priority theme of &#8216;Jobs, Stability &amp; Growth&#8217;, I have sought to prioritise youth employment during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Europe 2020 growth agenda emphasises the need to <i>&#8220;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;<\/i> while the current EU Strategy for Youth (2009) contains a key objective to   <i>&#8220;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;.<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  With this is mind, Ireland&#8217;s Youth Presidency Programme includes a priority focus on maximising the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular with respect to supporting youth employability.  Work is underway on draft council conclusions which I hope will be agreed at the EU Council of Youth Ministers meeting in Brussels in May which I will chair.

The response of the HSE provides an important update on the significant progress in developing aftercare supports, the development of greater consistency nationally and the challenges in making supports available to individual young people, including the need for multi-agency cooperation and the need to take account of the views of those leaving care who, ultimately as young adults must wish to avail of the aftercare arrangements being made available. I have arranged for my officials to forward a copy of this response to the Deputy today.<\/p><p>  The annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million.There are currently 42.2 whole time equivalent aftercare workers in the HSE. In addition, the HSE commissions aftercare services from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care. The most recent information available indicates that there are 1,387 young people in aftercare, the majority of whom are aged 18-19 years. Since November, I have received additional information regarding young people who were in foster care and I was advised by the HSE that approximately 640 young people aged 18 and over are living with their foster carers and are being supported financially by the HSE. A further 110 of the young people in aftercare are living in supported lodgings. Supported Lodgings are provided to young people in care and in need of accommodation and support aged between 16 and 18 years, who cannot live at home but are not yet ready to live independently. Supported Lodgings is a term used to describe when a young person lives with an adult or family in a domestic home and is provided with accommodation, care and support appropriate to their age and needs. Persons providing this service are fully assessed and monitored.<\/p><p>  The HSE National Aftercare Service which is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.<\/p><p>  The HSE has reported on the key findings of the National Implementation Group's review of aftercare provision. The review has shown that there is now a more systematic approach to ensuring that young people around age sixteen are identified through the care planning review process for assessment and through care planning. A standardised aftercare planning template is now being utilised nationally and this approach is helping to identify young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, earlier and has led to good examples of interagency working.   There have also been improvements in the statistical information available with additional new data being provided. While an aftercare service is provided across all areas, variations in how this is delivered and the level of aftercare allowances have been highlighted by the Group.<\/p><p>  The National Policy and Procedures Document sets out the eligibility criteria for an aftercare service. The care planing review process identifies young people as they approach 16 years and a process of assessment commences at that point, in conjunction with the wishes and views of the young person. Each individual's strengths and need for support is assessed across a number of areas, including whether they will continue to live with foster carers for a number of years after reaching age 18. The assessment also looks at life skills and capacity to live independently in the short and longer term; relationships with family, carers and significant others; emotional and behavioural development; health and overall wellbeing; identity and very importantly, educational\/training requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the particular difficulties some young people experience in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension, which is particularly important in the context of the HSE Children and Family Services' transition to the Child and Family Support Agency. Protocols are being developed with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care to support this approach. A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. In addition, a protocol with the Housing Authorities which will set out a clear framework for identifying quality aftercare accommodation and commit local authorities to consider the needs of young care leavers is in the final stages of preparation. <\/p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of aftercare service and the issue is under ongoing active consideration by the National Implementation Group. My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300071#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Support","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300071#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[7348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300071#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she supports subsidised childcare over benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>The balance between providing support to parents through child benefit and other income supports, or through subsidised childcare services, is a matter for the Government to decide in the context of budgetary discussions.<\/p><p>  My Department currently provides support to low-income parents to assist them with the cost of childcare through the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes.

Noting the lack of national data on teenagers' body image, they decided that this was an issue worth researching.  The survey was completed by 2,156 young people and gives new insights into how teenagers perceive themselves in an area of critical importance to their mental health.  The Survey found that body image is a burning issue for young people in Ireland with 77% of participants ranking body image as important to them. 57% of the young people surveyed expressed some level of satisfaction with their body image which means 43% were dissatisfied.<\/p><p><br \/>  The promotion of self esteem and a positive body image in young people is a complex issue requiring inputs from a wide range of stake-holders including parents, schools, the media, commercial organisations and the Health Service Executive (HSE) through its Health Promotion Programmes.

The issue of self esteem and body image is addressed as part of a holistic approach to health.  It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations. The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. Mindout is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people, looking at the ways they cope, ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.

There is a unit in Ballydowd in Dublin, which has a capacity of ten beds and is fully occupied, another in Gleann &Aacute;lainn in Cork, with a capacity of four beds and which currently has three children placed there, and Coovagh House in Limerick, which a capacity of three beds and is fully occupied.<\/p><p>  Additionally, there are two National High Support Units in Ireland, Rath Na n&Oacute;g in Castleblaney and Crann&oacute;g Nua in Portrane, both of which have capacity for six young people.  There are currently four young people placed in each of the two units.<\/p><p>  There are currently no young people approved and awaiting a special care placement.  There are seven young people under consideration by the National Special Care Admission and Discharge Committee.  This Committee is due to meet today.  There are currently two young people on transition into High Support.  There are eight young people under consideration for High Support, including two new referrals which will be discussed by the National High Support Admission and Discharge Committee, which is due to meet today.<\/p><p>  A full review of the capacity of the HSE Alternative Care Services is currently being undertaken by an Independent Consultant, under the lead of the Office of the National Director for Children Family Social Services.  The initial focus of this review was to consider the capacity requirements for the National High Support and Special Care Service.  I am advised by the HSE that a Capital Building Project with the HSE Architectural Services commenced work in late 2011.  Stage 2 of the design programme led to planning applications being lodged at the end of 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300072#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300072#WRC00650"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[7340\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300072#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she will bring forward the adoption tracing and information legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The drafting of the Heads of Bill in relation to the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department.

This level of funding represents an increase of &euro;16m over 2012 allocation and consists of &euro;417 million in current expenditure and &euro;26 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, Budget 2013 provides for &euro;546 million in the Health Service Executive Vote (HSE) for 2013 in respect of Children and Family Services. This consists of &euro;545 million in current expenditure and &euro;1 million in capital.<\/p><p>  The maintenance of the budgetary provision for child welfare and protection services at a time of wider curtailment in public expenditure reflects the priority attached by Government to this area.  The potential provided by these resources will be further strengthened in 2013 through reform and the establishment of the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency. This will involve moving the child welfare and protection services out of the HSE and creating a new statutory body which will also encompass both the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. Under the Government&rsquo;s reform programme, we are moving to a situation where child and family welfare is the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a single dedicated Government Department<\/p><p>  The funding allocated to my Department is providing for the retention of schemes and services during 2013, including retention of the universal free Pre-School Year, as well as the introduction of a number of important new initiatives and developments.  These include: a new School Age Childcare initiative with full year funding of  &euro;14 million, which will provide over 6,000 after-school places for children in primary school to support parents in low-income families to take up employment; a new &lsquo;Area Based Approach to Child Poverty&rsquo; initiative with a funding allocation in 2013 of &euro;2.5 million; and the provision of &euro;20.4 million  in capital funding to further develop the National Children Detention Facility at Oberstown and end the practice of detaining 17 year old boys in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.<\/p><p>  The initiative relating to School Age Childcare is a joint initiative with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  It is hoped to pilot the scheme in the coming months with a full roll-out from September 2013.  The new scheme will augment my Department&rsquo;s existing programme of childcare supports for low income parents, which with this additional funding will now amount to over &euro;88 million.  This programme includes the existing Childcare Community Subvention (CCS) and Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes.  These are in addition to the universal free pre-school year which has a separate budget of &euro;175 million.  Extending childcare provision has been a key priority for me and this initiative shows how Departments are working together to deliver on this Government&rsquo;s agenda to promote employment and to support children&rsquo;s development.<\/p><p>  The new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour.  We know that early intervention improves life chances for children and families.  This is even more true in communities with high levels of disadvantage and joblessness.<\/p><p>  I particularly welcome the provision in Budget 2013 of &euro;20.4 million in capital funding, to enable the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown to proceed.  Since assuming responsibility for the children detention system in January 2012, I have worked with my colleagues in Government on a range of actions to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The provision of new the facility in Oberstown, which is expected to be completed in 2015, will deliver all detention services for children in a single location which will maximise the scope for ensuring best practice standards and improving operational efficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300074#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children's Rights Referendum","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300074#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[6999\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300074#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the full McCrystal judgement handed down last week in the Supreme Court; the reason her Department used &euro;1.1 million of Exchequer funding to support the Yes campaign; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p> The judgement in <i>McKenna <\/i>stated that the Government has a duty to give information to the electorate as well as to clarify issues which may arise in the course of the campaign, and must do so without advocating a particular position.

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.   This function transferred in July 2011 to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 and S.I. No. 418\/2011  Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011.  The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it. The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.  <\/p><p>  It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September, 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office. The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986, approximately 14 years after the dissolution of the company. The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title. The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter for consideration in the context of the waiver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Legislation","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRL01150"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[7684\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the public pension options available to women who left the public service as a result of the marriage bar and returned to the public service in each of the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>Prior to 1974 pensionable female Public Servants were generally required to resign on marriage and, depending on their service, received a marriage gratuity in lieu of any pension benefits.  <\/p><p>  Public Servants who received a marriage gratuity and returned to the Public Service  have the option of (a) refunding the gratuity (plus interest where applicable) and having all reckonable prior service (i.e. before their resignation on marriage) aggregated with subsequent reckonable services for Superannuation purposes or (b) not refunding the gratuity and having their reckonable service for superannuation purposes commence from the date of their re-appointment only.<\/p><p>  Public Servants who had to resign on marriage but where not eligible to  receive the marriage gratuity may be able to have their entire service pensionable on payment of appropriate back contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2014 Issues","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[7623\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the estimated time of the publication of the estimates for 2014 in view of the fact that the publication of the estimates and the Budget are to be brought forward; the implications for discussing the estimates in the Oireachtas prior to their approval by Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>One of two draft economic and budgetary regulations, known as the &#8220;two-pack&#8221;, nearing finalisation in Europe, will introduce a common budgetary timeline for all euro area Member States.

Given this work, the only appointment made by me to the Board of Shannon Development in 2012 was the appointment of Stephen Curran of my Department to replace his predecessor, Mr Bob Keane.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Groups mentioned earlier assisted the Government in making its decision to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority in December 2012 last and in the on-going work of merging Shannon Development with Shannon Airport.  As part of this process the Government also agreed to ensure commonality in appointments to the boards of both Shannon Development and Shannon Airport in preparation for the establishment of the new entity.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport appointed Rose Hynes as Chair of the Shannon Airport Authority in December 2012 and I wish to inform the Deputy that I have recently appointed Ms Hynes to the Board of Shannon Development.

Implicitly, therefore, there were approximately 12,000 more people employed in the private sector in that period.  This conclusion is supported by the job creation figures of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for 2012.  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland client companies created more than 3,300 net new jobs, while IDA Ireland companies created over 6,500 net new jobs.

Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.<\/p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered.  However, Section 39 of the Act provides for the following exceptions:<\/p><p>  The death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State;<\/p><p>  The death of a person on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship;<\/p><p>  The death of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member.<\/p><p>  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State. <\/p><p>  Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate. In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.<\/p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection has recommended amending the current legislation in order to enable deaths of Irish citizens who have died abroad to be registered here. <\/p><p>  Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration. It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.<\/p><p>  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":304,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01200"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[7528\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for invalidity pension in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16th   January 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[7529\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16<sup>th<\/sup>   January 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements. <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Eligibility","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[7595\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider changing the qualifying criteria for free travel in respect of epilepsy patients who risk losing their jobs as a result of transportation difficulties as a result of their illness.","asker":"983","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>There are currently in excess of 745,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.

This additional layer would very seriously dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility, as well as the performance and effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time. The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p><p>  The separate roles of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided for under the provisions of the 2005 Act.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.  <\/p><p>  Another critical point overlooked by those who advocate a separate authority is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not only the police service in this jurisdiction, it is the security service and border control authority of the State.  To pass control of such matters to an unelected body beyond the executive and the legislature is untenable.  It is more appropriate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and to the Oireachtas - which are fully representative of, and dependent upon the support of the sovereign authority of the Irish people.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a Garda Authority and there is no such commitment in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRW00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Eligibility","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRW00125"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[7476\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an agri environment option scheme 2 application will be reviewed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p> The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st   September 2011 and full payment totalling &euro;338.07 issued in respect of 2011. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

This Act makes general provision for the control and eradication of disease, the categories of animals and classes of diseases to which the Act applies.  Section 20 of the Act empowers the Minister to make Ministerial Orders for specified purposes and the nature of offences that may be prosecuted.   The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1989 was made under powers conferred by several sections, including Section 20,   of the Act.  The Order provides for, inter alia, the prohibition of tuberculosis testing without Department permission, the type of test to be used, the tagging of reactors, the removal, movement, control and slaughter of reactors.  Similarly the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order, 1991 as amended was made under powers conferred by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, including section 20, and contains similar provisions to the TB Order.<\/p><p>The information relating to the total number of animals removed as TB and Brucellosis reactors under the Act is not readily available.  However, with regard to bovine TB, the number of reactors removed in selected years since 1960 is set out in the following Table.  I am pleased to be able to say that the TB situation has been steadily improving over the past 10 years or so as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.21% last year and reactor numbers in 2012 were, at 18,476, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  I am hopeful that the incidence of TB can be maintained at or below these levels.  Ireland is free of Brucellosis in sheep, pigs and cattle.<\/p><p><pcenter>TABLE 1.<\/pcenter><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1960<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>139,881<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1984<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>31,715<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1992<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>35,997<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2000<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>39,847<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2008<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,901<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1965<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>23,378<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1985<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>32,608<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1993<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,359<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2001<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>33,702<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2009<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>23,786<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1970<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>35,982<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1986<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,179<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1994<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,439<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2002<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,930<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2010<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>20,211<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1975<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>21,339<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1987<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,682<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1995<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>33,180<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2003<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,978<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2011<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>18,531<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1980<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,827<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1988<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,994<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1996<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,400<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2004<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>22,967<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2012<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>18,476<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1981<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>31,542<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1989<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>43,580<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1997<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,647<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2005<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>25,884<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1982<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,013<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1990<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>41,419<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1998<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>44,498<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2006<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>24,173<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1983<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,330<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1991<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>36,832<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1999<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>44,903<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2007<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,711<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[7638\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 833 of 16 January 2013, the position regarding an agri environment options scheme application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>An application under the Agri-environment Options Scheme was received in the Johnstown Castle Office of my Department from the person named on 28 November 2012.

This legislation was amended in September 2012 ( S.I. 371 of 2012) in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport. <\/p><p>  My Department of Agriculture is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department.

The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01050"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[7695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of beef, poultry, lamb and other meat products that were imported into Ireland in 2008, 2009, 2010; 2011, and 2012; if he will also indicate the reason for these level of imports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[7751\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason, in a country that produces an abundance of excellent beef, we are importing beef from other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 186 together.<\/p><p>It is assumed that the Deputies are referring to goods originating outside Ireland whether as a result of trade within the EU single market or imports sourced from non-EU countries.

The majority of these imports from the UK consisted of cow carcasses for further processing before being re-exported as primal joints. Brazil, Uruguay and the USA are the principal non-EU suppliers of beef into Ireland. Processors import beef from a range of countries in order to produce specific products for the export market at particular price points.<\/p><p>It is also worth pointing out that import figures are relatively small when compared to the quantity of beef exports. For example in 2012, Ireland exported over 412,000 tonnes of beef &ndash; virtually all of it to other EU member states &ndash; which was nearly 12 times as much as it imported.<\/p><p><b>Pigmeat<\/b><\/p><p>In 2012, almost 75,000 tonnes of pigmeat was imported into Ireland. Around 29,000 tonnes (38%) of imports came from the UK with 4 other member states &ndash; Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands &ndash; cumulatively accounting for some 39,000 tonnes (52%) of volume. Pigmeat imports are destined for secondary processors, wholesale and foodservice operators. Ireland has an import requirement for loin and leg primal because domestic consumers&rsquo; preference for loin (pork chops, bacon, rashers) and leg (cooked ham, gammons) differs from that in other European countries where more processed meats are preferred. The price differential between Irish and imported loins is approximately 20%. There is little difference in the price of indigenous versus imported legs but supply is an issue.<\/p><p><b>Poultrymeat<\/b><\/p><p>Ireland imports significant volumes of poultrymeat annually; namely broiler, turkey and duck.  Broiler meat in the form of chicken breast meat (frozen \/ chilled \/ cooked) comes principally from Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany and also international markets such as Thailand and Brazil. The product is used for wholesale, foodservice and further manufacturing. Turkey breast meat and crowns are imported mainly from Italy and Germany for cooked meats manufacturing and for catering \/ foodservice outlets. Whole turkeys, imported from Italy for the Christmas period, are supplied through the wholesale and butcher sectors. Typical cost differentials for imported versus domestic chicken and turkey can amount to as much as 30%.<\/p><p><b>Sheepmeat<\/b><\/p><p>Of the 3,467 tonnes of sheepmeat imported into the Irish market last year, almost 3,300 tonnes (94%) came from the UK. Imports, which peaked during the February to June period, were mainly British hoggets destined for food manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, foodservice. Imports from non-EU countries, primarily frozen product from New Zealand, were negligible at 83 tonnes. At present, Irish lamb commands a strong position in the domestic retail sector. The use of the Bord Bia Quality logo on-pack is growing in popularity since its launch on lamb in 2008. According to Bord Bia retail store audits, the percentage of facings of lamb product with the Quality Mark has risen from 55% to 84% in the 2 years from December 2010.<\/p><p><b>Other Meat Products<\/b><\/p><p>Products in this miscellaneous category, which includes offal, are imported mainly from the UK (47%) and the Netherlands (23%).<\/p><p><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/p><p>Ireland is a small, open economy that is hugely dependant on international trade flows in products and services. The above data demonstrate the extent to which the beef and other meat industries are reliant on trade with our EU partners and, by extension, the importance of that trade to the national economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":527,"content":"<p>Question No. 182 answered with Question No. 179.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Exports","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[7697\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of horses and ponies including thoroughbreds that were exported in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>The number of horses certified for export by my Department during the years in question is as set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>NO.

The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.<\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors. I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life.

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.<\/p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.<\/p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&rsquo;s development, health and wellbeing, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise, as a result of the current economic situation,  such as youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills and Department of Social Protection in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.  As part of the programme of the EU Presidency of the Youth Council, I will hold an expert round table on the subject in on 21st June 2013.<\/p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&rsquo;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.  My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them. <\/p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented,  contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan  and is undertaking a series of initiatives  to raise awareness about the problem and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.  The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  Consultations with young people themselves and their identification of needs for supports and facilities is a core feature of the National Play and Recreation policy. As a result of the policy many local authorities have developed world class play facilities. Youth cafes funded by my Department are a particular success responding directly to teenagers identified need for places to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo; and an alternative to pub and drug culture.  My Department estimates that there are between 75 and 100 youth cafes now in place around the country.  I will shortly be announcing details of the &euro;1.75m in capital funding that is available this year  for the further development of these and other facilities to respond to young people.<\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people.

The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion\/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.  It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations.  The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway.  MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.  Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.   <\/p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion.  This programme is accredited by NUI Galway and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion.  It focuses on a holistic model of an individual&rsquo;s health and mental health and reinforces youth work as a valuable setting for mental health promotion.  Actions needed to address this issue obviously extend beyond the remit of my Department. My Department is currently leading the preparation of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which will represent a whole-of-government approach to addressing issue affecting children and young people including their well being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":558,"content":"<p>Question No. 194 answered with Question No. 190.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00450"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[7578\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her Department can take any particular initiatives arising from the consequences of youth unemployment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to creating the environment for a strong economic recovery to support employment creation and jobs growth. Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the difficulties it poses for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include initiatives in respect of education, training, job search assistance\/work experience and support for job creation.   <\/p><p><br \/>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have sought to highlight and promote the potential of youth work as part of the continuum of youth employment supports and I welcome the growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiatives can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme. Minister Bruton is currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context my Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the inclusion in the plan of appropriate actions relating to the contribution of the youth sector in supporting youth employment, including through a greater focus on promoting and supporting volunteering opportunities.<\/p><p><br \/>  In line with the Ireland&#8217;s overall EU Presidency priority theme of &#8216;Jobs, Stability &amp; Growth&#8217;, I have sought to prioritise youth employment during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers.

Work is underway on draft council conclusions which I hope will be agreed at the EU Council of Youth Ministers meeting in Brussels in May which I will chair. I also plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to Europe 2020 and youth employment in June of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[7579\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will set out her proposals to enhance the extent of child protection measures throughout the country with particular reference to early intervention in situations of suspected child abuse of a physical and\/or sexual nature; the extent to which adequate resources are available to her Department in line with assessments undertaken in this regard by her officials; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[7580\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she intends to enhance the procedures to ensure a rapid response to reports and\/or suspicions of child abuse; if she has in mind any particular initiatives in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.

All reports of concern for the safety or well-being of a child are handled initially by the Duty\/Intake team for the purposes of assessment. All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to treat seriously all child welfare and protection concerns whatever their source. Once a report has been made the screening stage deals with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with formulating an appropriate response. <\/p><p><br \/>  Once it is agreed by the Duty Team Leader that it is a correct referral the case is allocated immediately for an Initial Assessment. This is a time limited process to allow the gathering of sufficient information on the needs and risks within a case so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made and actions that will result in better outcomes for children are taken.  The duty team leader, together with members of the team, will categorise the information received under the following categories:<\/p><p> -  level 1 - child and family must be seen immediately<\/p><p> -  level 2 - child and family must be seem within 3 days<\/p><p> -  level 3 - child and family must be seem within 7 days<\/p><p>Comprehensive information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation.<\/p><p><b><i>Children and Family Services Change Programme<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Currently, HSE Children and Family Services are engaged in a major programme of reform. A major element of the reform programme involves implementing consistent and timely child protection procedures in line with the revised Children First National Guidance<i>, <\/i>through a single, national, service delivery model, which is in development, and through the introduction of a National Child Care Information System (NCCIS).  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. The introduction of the NCCIS is a high priority and will help in the management of social work case management and will significantly improve the level, quality and accessibility of information in respect of Children and Family Services.<\/p><p><b><i>Resources<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First <\/i>has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999.

The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of <i>Children First<\/i>   throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.  In addition to the existing structures in place to support <i>Children First<\/i> , significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past few years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area. The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, as was the commitment to place Children First on a statutory basis.  <\/p><p><b><i>Children First Legislation<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the  in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  Following receipt of the Committee&#8217;s report, my Department is currently, in preparation of the legislation, considering the recommendations along with the broad range of submissions made, including any need for additional reporting guidance.<\/p><p><b><i>New Child and Family Support Agency<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services. The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. <\/p><p><br \/>  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function.

Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. <\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective. The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is complete and I understand that my colleague the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD intends to issue a policy statement on homelessness in the near future.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  I further understand that she will use the opportunity to indicate what she expects from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  As announced in Budget 2013, the Government committed to an Area-based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative, for which &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the 2013 Estimates.<\/p><p>  This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which has supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies. These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour and are currently being evaluated by national and international experts. It is important that we mainstream the learning from these pilot projects so that proven and effective supports for children and families can be delivered right through the country, including through the range of services to be provided by the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency.<\/p><p>  The new initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  In line with this commitment, my Department in conjunction with a number of Departments, including the Office of the Tan&aacute;iste and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government, and Education and Skills will work in 2013 to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6.  The new initiative will not simply be a continuation of the PEIP scheme but will instead seek to implement programmes which have already been evaluated and proven to work in improving outcomes for children and families at risk of disadvantage.  It is envisaged that this initiative will be co-funded by a philanthropic organisation and discussions are ongoing to this end.  It will not be possible in advance of the completion of these talks to know the final total funding levels including the co-funding component.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRAA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":570,"content":"<p>Question No. 200 answered with Question No. 190.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aftercare Services","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB00050"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[7608\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB00100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to introduce a statutory right to aftercare for children leaving the care system.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007.  To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, to provide a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time.  The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, pass the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams.  Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July.  In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE estimates that this will be sufficient to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[7474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new acute mental health admissions unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin will be operational; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[56766\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300076#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has looked at proposed changes to 16 and 17 year olds being seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; if he is satisfied that this will have no detrimental impact on mental health services for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) were traditionally provided to children aged 0 - 15 years, and care and treatment of 16 and 17 year olds was the responsibility of the adult service.

The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.

Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data is available on www.ptr.ie.  The data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.<\/p><p>  In the coming months, as winter pressures in Emergency Departments ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target that no adult should be waiting &gt; 8 months for in patient and day case surgery. <\/p><p>  These significant improvements in access and experience are being achieved despite the economic and budgetary pressures which must be dealt with and managed.

There are 24 Statements  of Learning which describe the core of learning at junior cycle. It is through  enjoyment, interest and being proactive that the young person will learn.<\/p><p>  In addition, there are 8 key skills in the Framework. The obvious ones are  literacy and numeracy but all 8 skills will be embedded in their learning  through subjects, the new short courses and other learning experiences. With  the skill of &quot;staying well&quot; it is expected that the young person will enhance  their confidence, be enabled to be co-operative and respecting of difference.<\/p><p>  The changes in assessment will also allow the student to gain evidence of  learning as they progress through junior cycle.

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.

The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it.

The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title.

Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.<\/p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered.  However, Section 39 of the Act provides for the following exceptions:<\/p><p>  The death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State;<\/p><p>  The death of a person on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship;<\/p><p>  The death of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member.<\/p><p>  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State. <\/p><p>  Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate. In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.<\/p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection has recommended amending the current legislation in order to enable deaths of Irish citizens who have died abroad to be registered here. <\/p><p>  Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration. It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.<\/p><p>  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":841,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01200"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[7528\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for invalidity pension in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16th   January 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":846,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[7529\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":847,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16<sup>th<\/sup>   January 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements. <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Eligibility","counter":848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[7595\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300083#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider changing the qualifying criteria for free travel in respect of epilepsy patients who risk losing their jobs as a result of transportation difficulties as a result of their illness.","asker":"983","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":850,"content":"<p>There are currently in excess of 745,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.

The current costing applied to a gluten free diet is &euro;68.43 per week for adults and &euro;6.50 per week for children. <\/p><p>  The last study into the cost of specialised diets was carried out in 2007.

Where there is a single national police force, the case for the setting up of a policing authority to act as a link between democratic institutions and the day to day responsibility for operational policing loses much of its force.  This additional layer would very seriously dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility, as well as the performance and effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time. The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p><p>  The separate roles of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided for under the provisions of the 2005 Act.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.  <\/p><p>  Another critical point overlooked by those who advocate a separate authority is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not only the police service in this jurisdiction, it is the security service and border control authority of the State.  To pass control of such matters to an unelected body beyond the executive and the legislature is untenable.  It is more appropriate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and to the Oireachtas - which are fully representative of, and dependent upon the support of the sovereign authority of the Irish people.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a Garda Authority and there is no such commitment in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300090#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300091#WRW00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Eligibility","counter":997,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300091#WRW00125"},{"type":"question","counter":998,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[7476\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300091#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an agri environment option scheme 2 application will be reviewed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":999,"content":"<p> The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st   September 2011 and full payment totalling &euro;338.07 issued in respect of 2011. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

This Act makes general provision for the control and eradication of disease, the categories of animals and classes of diseases to which the Act applies.  Section 20 of the Act empowers the Minister to make Ministerial Orders for specified purposes and the nature of offences that may be prosecuted.   The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1989 was made under powers conferred by several sections, including Section 20,   of the Act.  The Order provides for, inter alia, the prohibition of tuberculosis testing without Department permission, the type of test to be used, the tagging of reactors, the removal, movement, control and slaughter of reactors.  Similarly the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order, 1991 as amended was made under powers conferred by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, including section 20, and contains similar provisions to the TB Order.<\/p><p>The information relating to the total number of animals removed as TB and Brucellosis reactors under the Act is not readily available.  However, with regard to bovine TB, the number of reactors removed in selected years since 1960 is set out in the following Table.  I am pleased to be able to say that the TB situation has been steadily improving over the past 10 years or so as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.21% last year and reactor numbers in 2012 were, at 18,476, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  I am hopeful that the incidence of TB can be maintained at or below these levels.  Ireland is free of Brucellosis in sheep, pigs and cattle.<\/p><p><pcenter>TABLE 1.<\/pcenter><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Year<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1960<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>139,881<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1984<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>31,715<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1992<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>35,997<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2000<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>39,847<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2008<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,901<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1965<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>23,378<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1985<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>32,608<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1993<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,359<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2001<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>33,702<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2009<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>23,786<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1970<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>35,982<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1986<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,179<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1994<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,439<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2002<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,930<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2010<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>20,211<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1975<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>21,339<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1987<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,682<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1995<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>33,180<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2003<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,978<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2011<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>18,531<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1980<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,827<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1988<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>29,994<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1996<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,400<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2004<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>22,967<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2012<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>18,476<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1981<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>31,542<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1989<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>43,580<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1997<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>28,647<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2005<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>25,884<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1982<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,013<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1990<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>41,419<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1998<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>44,498<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2006<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>24,173<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>1983<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>30,330<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1991<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>36,832<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>1999<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>44,903<\/div><\/td><td><div><b>2007<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div>27,711<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300092#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":1034,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300092#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1035,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[7638\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300092#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 833 of 16 January 2013, the position regarding an agri environment options scheme application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1036,"content":"<p>An application under the Agri-environment Options Scheme was received in the Johnstown Castle Office of my Department from the person named on 28 November 2012.

This report estimated the total horse population in Ireland at approximately 180,000.

This legislation was amended in September 2012 ( S.I. 371 of 2012) in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport. <\/p><p>  My Department of Agriculture is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department.

The majority of these imports from the UK consisted of cow carcasses for further processing before being re-exported as primal joints. Brazil, Uruguay and the USA are the principal non-EU suppliers of beef into Ireland. Processors import beef from a range of countries in order to produce specific products for the export market at particular price points.<\/p><p>It is also worth pointing out that import figures are relatively small when compared to the quantity of beef exports. For example in 2012, Ireland exported over 412,000 tonnes of beef &ndash; virtually all of it to other EU member states &ndash; which was nearly 12 times as much as it imported.<\/p><p><b>Pigmeat<\/b><\/p><p>In 2012, almost 75,000 tonnes of pigmeat was imported into Ireland. Around 29,000 tonnes (38%) of imports came from the UK with 4 other member states &ndash; Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands &ndash; cumulatively accounting for some 39,000 tonnes (52%) of volume. Pigmeat imports are destined for secondary processors, wholesale and foodservice operators. Ireland has an import requirement for loin and leg primal because domestic consumers&rsquo; preference for loin (pork chops, bacon, rashers) and leg (cooked ham, gammons) differs from that in other European countries where more processed meats are preferred. The price differential between Irish and imported loins is approximately 20%. There is little difference in the price of indigenous versus imported legs but supply is an issue.<\/p><p><b>Poultrymeat<\/b><\/p><p>Ireland imports significant volumes of poultrymeat annually; namely broiler, turkey and duck.  Broiler meat in the form of chicken breast meat (frozen \/ chilled \/ cooked) comes principally from Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany and also international markets such as Thailand and Brazil. The product is used for wholesale, foodservice and further manufacturing. Turkey breast meat and crowns are imported mainly from Italy and Germany for cooked meats manufacturing and for catering \/ foodservice outlets. Whole turkeys, imported from Italy for the Christmas period, are supplied through the wholesale and butcher sectors. Typical cost differentials for imported versus domestic chicken and turkey can amount to as much as 30%.<\/p><p><b>Sheepmeat<\/b><\/p><p>Of the 3,467 tonnes of sheepmeat imported into the Irish market last year, almost 3,300 tonnes (94%) came from the UK. Imports, which peaked during the February to June period, were mainly British hoggets destined for food manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, foodservice. Imports from non-EU countries, primarily frozen product from New Zealand, were negligible at 83 tonnes. At present, Irish lamb commands a strong position in the domestic retail sector. The use of the Bord Bia Quality logo on-pack is growing in popularity since its launch on lamb in 2008. According to Bord Bia retail store audits, the percentage of facings of lamb product with the Quality Mark has risen from 55% to 84% in the 2 years from December 2010.<\/p><p><b>Other Meat Products<\/b><\/p><p>Products in this miscellaneous category, which includes offal, are imported mainly from the UK (47%) and the Netherlands (23%).<\/p><p><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/p><p>Ireland is a small, open economy that is hugely dependant on international trade flows in products and services.

In order for the public to have confidence in a youth justice system, it needs to be reasonably assured that it is effective in its policies and delivery.<\/p><p>  The focus for the forthcoming Youth Justice Action Plan will be to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and detention; becoming more adept in understanding and intervening in more serious crime offending patterns; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions in addressing the behaviour and needs of these children. The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities.

I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life.

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.<\/p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.<\/p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&rsquo;s development, health and wellbeing, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise, as a result of the current economic situation,  such as youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills and Department of Social Protection in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.  As part of the programme of the EU Presidency of the Youth Council, I will hold an expert round table on the subject in on 21st June 2013.<\/p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&rsquo;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.  My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them. <\/p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented,  contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan  and is undertaking a series of initiatives  to raise awareness about the problem and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.  The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  Consultations with young people themselves and their identification of needs for supports and facilities is a core feature of the National Play and Recreation policy. As a result of the policy many local authorities have developed world class play facilities. Youth cafes funded by my Department are a particular success responding directly to teenagers identified need for places to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo; and an alternative to pub and drug culture.  My Department estimates that there are between 75 and 100 youth cafes now in place around the country.  I will shortly be announcing details of the &euro;1.75m in capital funding that is available this year  for the further development of these and other facilities to respond to young people.<\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee is an important source of advice and guidance to my Department in  developing youth policy and initiatives.  The committee is composed of a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services. This committee advises my Department on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1090,"content":"<p>Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Awareness","counter":1092,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1093,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[7576\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will indicate, arising from her discussions with youth organisations and health service providers, the extent to which the issue of depression affecting young people has been examined; if it has been found possible to identify particular issues that might be addressed with a view to alleviation of the consequences of such depression; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1094,"content":"<p>The prime responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with depression currently lies with the Department of Health.

Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.

MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.

Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiatives can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme.

The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system.

Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. <\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective. The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is complete and I understand that my colleague the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD intends to issue a policy statement on homelessness in the near future.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  I further understand that she will use the opportunity to indicate what she expects from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  As announced in Budget 2013, the Government committed to an Area-based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative, for which &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the 2013 Estimates.<\/p><p>  This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which has supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies. These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour and are currently being evaluated by national and international experts. It is important that we mainstream the learning from these pilot projects so that proven and effective supports for children and families can be delivered right through the country, including through the range of services to be provided by the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency.<\/p><p>  The new initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  In line with this commitment, my Department in conjunction with a number of Departments, including the Office of the Tan&aacute;iste and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government, and Education and Skills will work in 2013 to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6.  The new initiative will not simply be a continuation of the PEIP scheme but will instead seek to implement programmes which have already been evaluated and proven to work in improving outcomes for children and families at risk of disadvantage.  It is envisaged that this initiative will be co-funded by a philanthropic organisation and discussions are ongoing to this end.  It will not be possible in advance of the completion of these talks to know the final total funding levels including the co-funding component.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRAA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1107,"content":"<p>Question No. 200 answered with Question No. 190.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aftercare Services","counter":1109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB00050"},{"type":"question","counter":1110,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[7608\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB00100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to introduce a statutory right to aftercare for children leaving the care system.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1111,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare.

The HSE responded to my Department at the end of November in relation to the key findings of the National Implementation Group and provided information on the current provision of aftercare, assessment of need, multi-agency working and the HSE policy regarding section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which provides that the HSE must take all reasonable steps to make suitable accommodation available to a child who is in need of accommodation.<\/p><p>  The response of the HSE provides an important update on the significant progress in developing aftercare supports, the development of greater consistency nationally and the challenges in making supports available to individual young people, including the need for multi-agency cooperation and the need to take account of the views of those leaving care who, ultimately as young adults must wish to avail of the aftercare arrangements being made available.  There have been improvements in the delivery of aftercare service and the issue is under ongoing active consideration by the National Implementation Group.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[7620\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline any initiatives she is undertaking to promote collective activities for youth people of a social and recreational nature to reduce isolation and encourage social inter action and confidence building.","asker":"1015","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1114,"content":"<p>My Department has a specific role in supporting the provision of youth services and facilities and promoting non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people in out-of-school settings through which they can enhance their personal and social skills and competencies.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007.  To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, to provide a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time.  The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, pass the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams.  Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July.  In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE estimates that this will be sufficient to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[7474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new acute mental health admissions unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin will be operational; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":1139,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[56766\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has looked at proposed changes to 16 and 17 year olds being seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; if he is satisfied that this will have no detrimental impact on mental health services for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1140,"content":"<p>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) were traditionally provided to children aged 0 - 15 years, and care and treatment of 16 and 17 year olds was the responsibility of the adult service.

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists, I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.<\/p><p>  Scheduled care &ndash; in-patient and daycase.  The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery  was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease.  The number of children waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase surgery was down to 89 from 1,759 in December 2011, a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure went down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, a 99% decrease.<\/p><p>  Outpatient services.  Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data is available on www.ptr.ie.  The data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.<\/p><p>  In the coming months, as winter pressures in Emergency Departments ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target that no adult should be waiting &gt; 8 months for in patient and day case surgery. <\/p><p>  These significant improvements in access and experience are being achieved despite the economic and budgetary pressures which must be dealt with and managed.  They reflect my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them<\/p><p>   The HSE publishes monthly performance reports on their website.  These reports include information on impatient and daycase waiting lists for adults and children, broken down by hospital and region.  The monthly performance reports can be accessed via this link:  <\/p><p>  <\/p><p>  The latest report available is for December 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to your request for data detailing the numbers of patients waiting for elective procedures over the last three years, I have forwarded your question to the HSE who will respond to you directly in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[7736\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in the opening of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[7737\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he or his Department have intervened in the matter of the failure of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, to open; and if so, if he will provide details of same;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[7738\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that additional resources are provided to the Mater Hospital, Dublin, to allow them to opening the new emergency department; if so, if he will detail these resources;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[7739\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a new date for the opening of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[7740\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300093#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that there is no interruption to the provision of emergency services to the inner city when the relocation of the emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, takes place unlike the previous scheduled closure;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1222,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 242, inclusive, together.<\/p><p> The MMUH is undertaking the most significant transformative reform programme in its history.

Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.<\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors. I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life. In order to design and develop effective policies and services that make a difference, then as a first step, we need to better understand our children: their lives, their experiences, their expectations.<\/p><p>  My Department's National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives  2011-2016 sets out a 5 year plan to guide and support the development and use of research and data on children&rsquo;s lives, for the purpose of improving understandings and creating an evidence base to support policy and practice. Several of the priority areas identified in the strategy relate to the experience of children and young people in contact or in danger of coming in contact with the justice system. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the commitment given at broader systemic and cultural level through the way we deliver services, in particular through the work of the new Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) which will be established this year. At the heart of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases, such that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support. The new Agency will represent the practical application of a new approach towards 'proportionate' service responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[7573\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which she continues to engage with youth organisations in the context of meeting the requirements of children and young people in general; if any particular issues have arisen wherein her Department may be able to make a positive intervention with particular reference to the impact of the on-going economic situation on young people; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[7574\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she has identified the main issues affecting young people in today&rsquo;s economic situation; the degree to which she can find herself in a position to respond to any such needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[7577\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which research has been undertaken to identify the most common causes of concern and stress amongst young people in modern times; the extent to which any corrective measures can be put in place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[7581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she and\/or her Department will provide intervention and\/or support services to teenagers or young people who are subjected to bullying outside of school hours or in employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[7583\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the extent to which she and her Department have identified the most serious deficiencies in children and youth support or other services; the progress made in addressing such issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 191, 194, 198 and 200 together.<\/p><p>  Funding of &euro;53.173m, including &euro;1.75 for a new capital funding programme, has been provided to my Department in 2013 for the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country through a number of schemes.<\/p><p>  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force projects and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.<\/p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.<\/p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&rsquo;s development, health and wellbeing, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise, as a result of the current economic situation,  such as youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills and Department of Social Protection in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.  As part of the programme of the EU Presidency of the Youth Council, I will hold an expert round table on the subject in on 21st June 2013.<\/p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&rsquo;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.  My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them. <\/p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented,  contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan  and is undertaking a series of initiatives  to raise awareness about the problem and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.  The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  Consultations with young people themselves and their identification of needs for supports and facilities is a core feature of the National Play and Recreation policy. As a result of the policy many local authorities have developed world class play facilities. Youth cafes funded by my Department are a particular success responding directly to teenagers identified need for places to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo; and an alternative to pub and drug culture.  My Department estimates that there are between 75 and 100 youth cafes now in place around the country.  I will shortly be announcing details of the &euro;1.75m in capital funding that is available this year  for the further development of these and other facilities to respond to young people.<\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee is an important source of advice and guidance to my Department in  developing youth policy and initiatives.  The committee is composed of a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services. This committee advises my Department on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300094#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1261,"content":"<p>Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Awareness","counter":1263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300095#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1264,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[7576\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300095#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will indicate, arising from her discussions with youth organisations and health service providers, the extent to which the issue of depression affecting young people has been examined; if it has been found possible to identify particular issues that might be addressed with a view to alleviation of the consequences of such depression; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1265,"content":"<p>The prime responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with depression currently lies with the Department of Health.

The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion\/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.  It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations.  The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway.  MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.

Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiatives can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme.

Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. <\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective. The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is complete and I understand that my colleague the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD intends to issue a policy statement on homelessness in the near future.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  I further understand that she will use the opportunity to indicate what she expects from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  As announced in Budget 2013, the Government committed to an Area-based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative, for which &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the 2013 Estimates.<\/p><p>  This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which has supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies. These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour and are currently being evaluated by national and international experts. It is important that we mainstream the learning from these pilot projects so that proven and effective supports for children and families can be delivered right through the country, including through the range of services to be provided by the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency.<\/p><p>  The new initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  In line with this commitment, my Department in conjunction with a number of Departments, including the Office of the Tan&aacute;iste and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government, and Education and Skills will work in 2013 to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007.  To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, to provide a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time.  The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, pass the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams.  Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July.  In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE estimates that this will be sufficient to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300096#WRBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300096#WRBB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[7474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300096#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new acute mental health admissions unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin will be operational; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1307,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300096#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":1310,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[56766\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300097#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has looked at proposed changes to 16 and 17 year olds being seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; if he is satisfied that this will have no detrimental impact on mental health services for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1311,"content":"<p>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) were traditionally provided to children aged 0 - 15 years, and care and treatment of 16 and 17 year olds was the responsibility of the adult service.

They would typically work in orthodontic practices under the supervision of an orthodontist. To date there has been no registerable training programme approved in Ireland for orthodontic therapists. The Council has recently put in place a mechanism whereby dental nurses can undertake a UK qualification while doing their clinical training under the clinical supervision of Irish based orthodontists. There are currently 4 registered orthodontic therapists in Ireland and up to 10 others in training or undergoing adaptation placements.  A HSE review of orthodontic services is underway. The outcome of this review will give guidance as to what changes will be desirable to provide the best model of care delivery, given current resources and expected future demand for services.

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists, I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.<\/p><p>  Scheduled care &ndash; in-patient and daycase.  The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery  was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease.  The number of children waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase surgery was down to 89 from 1,759 in December 2011, a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure went down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, a 99% decrease.<\/p><p>  Outpatient services.  Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data is available on www.ptr.ie.  The data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.<\/p><p>  In the coming months, as winter pressures in Emergency Departments ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target that no adult should be waiting &gt; 8 months for in patient and day case surgery. <\/p><p>  These significant improvements in access and experience are being achieved despite the economic and budgetary pressures which must be dealt with and managed.  They reflect my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them<\/p><p>   The HSE publishes monthly performance reports on their website.  These reports include information on impatient and daycase waiting lists for adults and children, broken down by hospital and region.  The monthly performance reports can be accessed via this link:  <\/p><p>  <\/p><p>  The latest report available is for December 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to your request for data detailing the numbers of patients waiting for elective procedures over the last three years, I have forwarded your question to the HSE who will respond to you directly in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[7736\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in the opening of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1389,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[7737\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he or his Department have intervened in the matter of the failure of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, to open; and if so, if he will provide details of same;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1390,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[7738\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that additional resources are provided to the Mater Hospital, Dublin, to allow them to opening the new emergency department; if so, if he will detail these resources;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1391,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[7739\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a new date for the opening of the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1392,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[7740\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021300100#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that there is no interruption to the provision of emergency services to the inner city when the relocation of the emergency department at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, takes place unlike the previous scheduled closure;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1393,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 242, inclusive, together.<\/p><p> The MMUH is undertaking the most significant transformative reform programme in its history.
